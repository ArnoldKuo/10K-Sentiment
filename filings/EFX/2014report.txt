reputation as a trusted steward of information          8             technology and intellectual property     we generally seek protection under federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by registration under applicable trademark laws or by prosecution of patent applications we own a number of patents registered in the us and several in foreign countries we also have certain registered trademarks service marks logos and internet urls in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of which are equifax the work number and variations thereof these marks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents or trademark however certain company trademarks which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services including but not limited to the equifax trademark are an integral part of our business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us we also protect certain of our confidential intellectual property and technology in compliance with trade secret laws and we protect disclosed confidential intellectual property and technology with nondisclosure agreements     we license other companies to use certain data software and other technology and intellectual property rights we own or control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property other companies license us to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control for example we license creditscoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee additionally such licenses do not contain early termination provisions except for standard provisions providing the right to terminate in the event of breach by the other party we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations     governmental regulation     we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business these laws and regulations may involve privacy data protection intellectual property competition consumer protection anticorruption antibribery employment health taxation or other subjects in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding the collection protection dissemination and use of nonpublic personal information we have in our possession and consumer financial protection foreign data and consumer protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements or the adoption of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations financial condition or liquidity     us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain these laws are enforced by federal state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and in some instances also through private civil litigation there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us     summary of us regulation relating to consumer and data protection     our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers use of consumer credit or other data we furnish     examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following     federal laws and regulation           the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the us financial services industry among other things title x of the doddfrank act established a new independent regulatory agency known as the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers significant portions of federal regulatory oversight of the fair credit reporting act as amended fcra have been transferred from the federal trade commission ftc to the cfpb the cfpb is charged with defining unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices known as udaap and also may require reports and conduct examinations for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws may obtain information about the business activities affecting consumers and compliance systems or procedures and will devote resources to detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services            9             the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties     under udaap the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices to be unfair deceptive or abusive during 2013 the cfpb announced more than 20 enforcement actions and imposed more than 73 million in civil penalties and 27 billion in restitution     if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have material adverse effect on us we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in the form 10k at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb or exercise of its or other enforcement powers will impact our operational results financial condition or liquidity     the cfpb confirmed in 2012 through rulemaking that we are subject to its supervisory examination and enforcement authority examinations may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures our cfpb examinations to date have included our regulatory compliance management system and our north america personal solutions business unit directtoconsumer and an examination is planned for our consumer dispute handling process we are continuing to constructively engage with the cfpb on the results of completed or pending examinations           the federal trade commission act ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices we must comply with the ftc act when we market our services such as consumer credit monitoring services offered through our personal solutions unit the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the ftc act and failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action there is no private right of action under the ftc act             the fcra regulates consumer reporting agencies including us as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports such as banks and other companies fcra provisions govern the accuracy fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies cras that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes the fcra limits the type of information that may be reported by cras limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes customer rights to access and dispute their credit files cras are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates and if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumers file to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation cras are required to make available to consumers a free annual credit report the fcra imposes many other requirements on cras data furnishers and users of consumer report information violation of the fcra can result in civil and criminal penalties the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against a cra for violations of the fcra regulatory enforcement of the fcra is by the federal trade commission ftc the cfpb and the state attorneys general acting alone or in concert with one another             the financial services modernization act of 1999 or grammleachbliley act glb act regulates among other things the use of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers that is held by financial institutions including us we are subject to various glb act provisions including rules relating to the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the physical administrative and technological protection of nonpublic personal financial information breach of the glb act can result in civil andor criminal liability and sanctions by regulatory authorities such as fines of up to 100000 per violation and up to five years imprisonment for individuals regulatory enforcement of the glb act is under the purview of the ftc and state attorneys general acting alone or in concert with each other             the credit repair organizations act croa regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing there have been efforts to apply the croa to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others croa allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged credit repair services in the event of violation            10             state laws and regulation relating to consumer and data protection           a number of states have enacted requirements similar to the federal fcra some of these state laws impose additional or more stringent requirements than the fcra especially in connection with the investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports the fcra preempts some of these state laws but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts the state of vermont is grandfathered under the original fcra requirements and thus we are subject to additional requirements to comply with vermont law             most states and the district of columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name these laws place differing requirements on credit reporting agencies with respect to how and when to respond to such credit file freeze requests and in the fees if any the agencies may charge for freezerelated actions             a majority of states have adopted versions of data security breach laws that require notification of affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information some of these laws require additional data protection measures which exceed the glb act data safeguarding requirements if data within our system is compromised by a breach we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws       summary of international regulation relating to consumer and data protection     we are subject to various data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate including among others the following           in canada federal and provincial privacy and provincial laws govern how we collect use or disclose personal information in the course of our commercial activities the federal personal information protection and electronic documents act of 2000 gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by us and requires compliance with the canadian standard association model code for the protection of personal information covering accountability and identifying purposes consent collection use disclosure retention accuracy safeguards individual access and compliance the federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention and provisions of canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned the european union or eu recognizes canada as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing             in the uk we are subject effective april 1 2014 to a new regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it will have the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has not yet fixed the date when credit reference agencies or collection businesses must apply for this authorization we are preparing to submit our license applications on or about october 1 2014 which is the earliest date the fca may require applications although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable licenses are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk             in europe we are subject to the european union eu data protection regulations including the comprehensive 1995 european union data protection directive the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security the eu standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries where equifax operates in the uk in addition to the eu directive on data protection the data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data in addition regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations in spain and portugal the privacy laws which are subject to the eu directive on data protection regulate all credit bureau and personal solutions activities regulation relating to the 1995 eu data protection directive was proposed in 2012 by the european commission and is currently being considered by european legislative bodies that among other things could tighten data protection requirements and make enforcement more rigorous for example by streamlining enforcement at a european level introducing data breach notification requirements and increasing penalties for noncompliance            11                   in latin america consumer reporting data protection and privacy laws and regulations exist in various forms in argentina chile costa rica ecuador el salvador paraguay peru and uruguay argentina and uruguay generally follow the eu data protection model and the eu recognizes argentinas laws as providing adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing among other protections laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal data             constitutional laws in argentina chile ecuador peru and uruguay also establish specific privacy rights and judicial proceedings may be used to enforce them the chilean legislature is considering a comprehensive data protection bill and a separate bill that would create a publiclymanaged consumer credit registry although each of these bills would introduce a new framework to allow the government to regulate the collection and use of personal data including credit data they are expected to have only a limited impact on our business in chile ecuadors national assembly recently approved a law to replace private sector credit bureaus with a staterun registry which when implemented would materially impact our local credit reporting operations in ecuador ecuador however represents less than three percent of our anticipated revenue and operating profit for our international business unit and is not material to our consolidated results of operations the government has not issued regulations yet to implement the changes and has indicated that private sector companies will be permitted to provide unspecified credit reference services ecuadors wtogatt commitments include no market access or national treatment limits for credit reference services the law provided a transition period throughout 2013 for the development and introduction of the new registry and that transition period has been extended through 2014 legislation has also been proposed in argentina and uruguay that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be used and create new access and notification rights for data subjects the argentinean legislation has not proceeded beyond the introductory debate stage and the uruguayan government does not support the legislation proposed in that country costa rica is finalizing regulations that will be issued under its data protection legislation while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be material             in india various legislation including the information technology act 2000 and the credit information companies regulation act of 2005 establishes a federal data protection framework entities that collect and maintain personal credit information must ensure that it is complete accurate and safeguarded and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting processing preserving sharing and using such credit information the indian parliament has passed legislation that would allow individuals to sue for damages in the case of a data breach if the entity negligently failed to implement reasonable security practices and procedures to protect personal data our indian joint venture is subject to regulation by the reserve bank of india which is the indian central bank       tax management services     the tax management services business within our workforce solutions segment is potentially impacted by changes

described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be

uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below     uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us     although there has been some improvement in overall global macroeconomic conditions in 2013 we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available     in particular our total mortgagerelated revenue slowed dramatically in the second half of 2013 a trend we expect will continue through the first half of 2014 mortgagerelated revenue was approximately 17 of our consolidated revenue in 2013 for further information see the business environment and company outlook and other sections of the managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k     the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services     we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable          15             our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins     we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins     we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell tribureau and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability     some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins     if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer     we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process     security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer     in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy          16             despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events     we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention     our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties     we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection the fair credit reporting act fcra regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer report information by banks and other companies these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us for example new data protection regulations currently being considered by the european union eu legislative bodies propose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to noneu countries reliance on express consent from data subjects as opposed to assumed or implied consent a right to require data processors to delete personal data and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms     the federal doddfrank act enacted in 2010 established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad powers to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws the cfpb is authorized to adopt rules supervise and examine and enforce and administer federal consumer laws including most aspects of the fcra and other laws applicable to us and our financial customers and specifically to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap the doddfrank act also empowers state attorneys general to bring civil actions to enforce the fcra and cfpb regulations the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb utilizing its udaap authority the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices without notice to be unfair deceptive or abusive during 2013 the cfpb announced more than 20 enforcement actions and imposed more than 73 million in civil penalties and 27 billion in restitution we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k     in the uk we are subject effective april 1 2014 to a new regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has not yet fixed the date when credit reference agencies or collection businesses must apply for this authorization we are preparing to submit our license applications on or about october 1 2014 which is the earliest date the fca may require applications although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable licenses are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk     we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable rules cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions          17                   these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see item 1 business  government regulation in this form 10k     we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes     we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the number of consumer lawsuits against us alleging a violation of fcra has increased substantially over the past several years     the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results     during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses we also completed the integration of the credit services business and assets we acquired from csc credit services inc on december 28 2012 for 10 billion in january 2014 we acquired tdx group a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 327 million expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition     dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively     as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty     the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business     the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us          18             the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases     public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our uscis and personal solutions business units to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these public sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected     our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows     we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows     if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer     we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer     third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services     from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all     third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights     our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage     we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue          19             economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations     sales outside the us comprised 23 of our net operating revenue in 2013 and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including        changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions          trade protection measures          data privacy and consumer protection regulations          difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations          differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations          business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions          difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner          implementation of exchange controls and          geopolitical instability including terrorism and war       we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2013 a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see segment financial results  international  latin america and  canada consumer and effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the managements discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results     we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the companys ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment     compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur     a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets     the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on december 19 2017 the credit agreement and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit agreement negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations          20             changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income     rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income     our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel     our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees     changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income     federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws     we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business     in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business     item 1b unresolved staff comments     equifax has not received written comments regarding its periodic or current reports for the sec staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2013 fiscal year and that remain unresolved     item 2 properties     our executive offices are located at 1550 peachtree street nw atlanta georgia our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide we consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet our current operating requirements and most of the space is being utilized we ordinarily lease office space for conducting our business and are obligated under approximately 80 leases and other rental arrangements for our field locations we owned 6 office buildings at december 31 2013 including our executive offices two buildings which house our alpharetta georgia data center two buildings utilized by our workforce solutions operations located in st louis missouri and charleston south carolina as well as a building utilized by our latin america operations located in sao paulo brazil we also own 235 acres adjacent to the alpharetta georgia data center     for additional information regarding our obligations under leases see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report we believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate our future needs          21             item 3 legal proceedings     california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al  plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims the district court subsequently deferred final approval of the settlement and required the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs counsel fee award mailing of the supplemental notice was completed on february 15 2011 the deadline for this group of settling plaintiffs to provide additional documentation to support their damage claims or to optout of the settlement was march 31 2011 on july 15 2011 following another approval hearing the district court approved the settlement several objecting plaintiffs subsequently filed notices of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which on april 22 2013 issued an order remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings on january 21 2014 the district court denied the objecting plaintiffs motion to disqualify counsel for the settling plaintiff and granted the motion of counsel for the settling plaintiffs to be appointed as interim lead class counsel     state attorney general investigations the attorneys general of the state of ohio and multiple other states commenced an investigation in late 2012 into certain business practices of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion presently there are 32 states participating in this investigation in addition the attorneys general for the states of new york and mississippi have commenced separate investigations into the same or similar matters being reviewed by the multistate attorney general investigation we are cooperating with the attorneys general in these investigations at this time we are unable to predict the outcomes of these investigations including whether the investigations will result in any actions or proceedings being brought against us     cfpb investigation in february 2014 we received a civil investigative demand a cid from the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb as part of its investigation to determine whether nationwide consumer reporting agencies have been or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the advertising marketing sale or provision of consumer reports credit scores or credit monitoring products in violation of the dodd frank act or the fair credit reporting act the cid requests the production of documents and answers to written questions we are cooperating with the cfpb in its investigation and are in discussions with the cfpb regarding our response to the cid at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of this cfpb investigation including whether the investigation will result in any action or proceeding against us     other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process     item 4 mine safety disclosures     not applicable          22                     part ii     item 5 market for the registrants common equity related stockholder matters and

correlated to general levels of economic activity to consumer credit activity to a lesser extent small commercial credit and marketing activity and to our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served in 2013 in the united states we experienced modest growth in overall economic activity and in general consumer credit a moderate yearoveryear decline in consumer mortgage activity and continuing benefits from our internal product and market initiatives as expected after growing in the first half of 2013 total company mortgage related revenues declined significantly in the second half of 2013 a trend we expect will continue into the first half of 2014 as a result our mortgage solutions business units rate of yearoveryear revenue growth slowed in 2013 and the mortgagerelated components of revenue included in uscis online consumer information solutions and workforce solutions verification services each declined in absolute terms compared to 2012 while we continue to expect modest growth in overall economic activity and general consumer credit to continue in 2014 mortgage market origination activity is expected to continue declining due to elevated interest rates internationally the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political fiscal and economic issues in addition recent weakening in foreign exchange rates of certain of the countries in which we participate will reduce growth in revenue and profit when reported in us dollars offsetting these challenges we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver longterm average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long term business strategy we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2014 we expect to offset the negative growth in mortgagerelated revenues with strong revenue growth in our core nonmortgage market initiatives          29             results of operations   twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011     consolidated financial

growth was driven by the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 csc credit services acquisition and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the first half of 2013 also benefitted from the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us which as expected began to decline in the second half of 2013 as compared to the prior year this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our uscis and workforce solutions business units for the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013 for the full year the net decline in mortgage market activity reduced our revenue growth rate by approximately 17 the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 204 million in the 2013 compared to 2012     revenue for 2012 increased by 9 compared to 2011 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into a larger entity during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue growth by 354 million in 2012 compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 12 compared to 2011 the growth in 2012 was driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives and the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us the effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil reduced revenue by 125 million in 2012 compared to the prior

prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased salary and benefit costs of 278 million as well as smaller increases across other categories the csc credit services acquisition did not have a material impact on cost of services as this business had already been processed on our systems under our previous affiliate arrangement the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 49 million     cost of services increased 556 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 632 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million          30             selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 423 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due primarily to increased salary severance advertising litigation and regulatory compliance expenses of 564 million as well as smaller increases in expense in various categories as we continue to support our business growth 2013 expenses were also impacted by the csc credit services acquisition which contributed approximately 19 million of incremental selling general and administrative expenses some of which are transitional expenses as we integrate the business these expenses were partially offset by the 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 and declines in incentive costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 44 million     the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 664 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 27 million     depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by 491 million of incremental expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles the csc credit services acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 as well as other miscellaneous purchased intangible assets that fully depreciated during 2013     the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce

operating income increased faster than revenue due to margin improvements in our workforce solutions north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions businesses reflecting rapid revenue growth and the ability to leverage our existing cost base operating income in 2012 was also negatively impacted by the 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012     in 2012 operating expenses increased at a slightly faster rate than revenue and operating income increased at a lower rate than revenue due to a 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth

commercial paper during 2013 that was used to partially fund the csc credit services acquisition the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2013 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year     interest expense increased slightly in 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011 due to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 our consolidated debt balance increased at december 31 2012 as a result of the issuance of 500 million of 330 senior notes and additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of csc credit services the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2012 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year period     the increase in other expense income net in 2013 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment

reduced nearterm market expectations for credit information services in brazil and increased investment needed to achieve its strategic objectives as a result of these changes and the associated nearterm changes in cash flow expected from the business we recorded a 40 million brazilian reais 170 million impairment of our original investment of 130 million brazilian reais if the economic growth in brazil remains at lower than trend levels for an extended period or if bvs is unsuccessful in effectively implementing its strategy further writedowns could be recognized in future periods     other expense income net in 2013 also includes 65 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds these expenses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture     other expense income net from continuing operations for 2012 decreased 143 million as compared to the prior year periods the decrease is primarily due to the merger of our brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011 on may 31 2011 we completed the merger of our brazilian business with bvs which was accounted for as a sale and deconsolidated in exchange for a 15 equity interest in bvs the brazilian transaction we recorded a 103 million pretax loss on the brazilian transaction in other expense income net other expense net was also reduced in 2012 by higher income from our minority investment in russia and interest earned on higher cash balances during 2012

compared to the prior year the csc credit services acquisition contributed 14 of the revenue growth in 2013 the remaining growth resulted from midsingle digit percentage growth from core nonmortgage products and from strategic product market penetration and pricing initiatives in the mortgage market more than offsetting a 2 decline from lower mortgage market activity in 2013     the increase in revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to the impact of a high level of mortgage activity as well as certain new product pricing and market penetration initiatives implemented during 2011 and into 2012     ocis revenue for 2013 increased 14 when compared to the prior year this increase was driven primarily by the incremental revenue from the csc credit services acquisition as compared to the prior year excluding the csc credit services acquisition revenue increased 1 in 2013 as compared to a year ago a 3 decline in 2013 in organic credit report transaction volume compared to the prior year was due to a decline in mortgagerelated credit report volume and lower volume from select high volume but lower priced accounts in the financial services market as well as changes in usage in the telecommunications sector this was offset by higher average unit revenue due to pricing initiatives and more favorable mix     2012 revenue increased 17 when compared to the prior year about half of

   liquidity and financial condition     management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions     sources and uses of cash     funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility as described below at december 31 2013 7486 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders

the 2011 impact of divestitures increased 515 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven primarily by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably a 520 million reduction in cash used in current liabilities reflecting in part an increase in accrued salaries and incentives partially offset by a change in accrued taxes including certain items related to the merger of our business in brazil into bvs the increase was also driven by 40 million of pension contributions in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 these increases were partially offset by

senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes     our 7500 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility     at december 31 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2013 a total of 7486 million was available under our senior credit facility     at december 31 2013 approximately 81 of our debt was fixed rate and 19 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bearing interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor and of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2013 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 187 to 204     borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program when available     the decrease in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2013 primarily reflects the repayment of 2650 million of cp notes that were outstanding as of december 31 2012 the change in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2012 primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of 2650 million of cp notes as of december 31 2012 that was used to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services     on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012          41             debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 174 at december 31 2013 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants     we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest     credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency     longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2013 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2012 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment            42                  for additional information about our debt

timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2013 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance           5  for future interest payments on variablerate debt which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2013 to calculate these payments our variable rate debt at december 31 2013 consisted of cp borrowings under our credit facilities and our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2013 through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2013 ranged from 187 to 204 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates           6  this table excludes 226 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities            44             offbalance sheet transactions     we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities     pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 826 million and 707 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company     letters of credit and guarantees     we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2013 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2013     benefit plans     we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011     at december 31 2013 the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 26 million and 37 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities     for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap     for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report     seasonality     we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest          45             effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates     equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability     a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency     recent accounting pronouncements     for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report     application of critical accounting policies and estimates     the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions     revenue recognition     revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes     if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met          46             the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract     we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract     many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract     we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance     we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction     deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies     judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services     in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported          47             effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue     goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets     we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have nine reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services     the goodwill balance at december 31 2013 for our nine reporting units was as follows                     december 31                       2013                       in millions           consumer information solutions              9714           id management

performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our consumer information solutions europe canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units     judgments and uncertainties  in determining the fair value the id management and latin america reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value          48             under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our competition discussion in item 1 of our 2013 form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information latin america and id management have benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple     the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value     we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test     growth assumptions     the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our managements discussion amp analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve     we projected revenue growth in 2014 for our reporting units in completing our 2013 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in our reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2014 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful acceleration of global economic growth in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units          49                   discount rate assumptions     we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the companys tax rate for the 2013 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated were 11 and 17 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states such as our latin america reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit     estimated fair value and sensitivities     the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2013 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for these reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of september 30 2013 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded     the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the companys reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2013 were 27 and 40     no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2013 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2013     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material          50             loss contingencies     we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote     judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material     income taxes     we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable     our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals     judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities     we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2013 226 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 60 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material     pension and other postretirement plans     we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost     judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material          51             we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan     the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2013 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 75 for the fourth time in the last five years the expected return for 2014 remains at 75 which is consistent with the rate used for 2013 the crip earned 135 in 2013 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the fourth time in five years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2014 is 743 which was also the 2013 expected rate     annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5548 million at december 31 2013 we do not expect our 2014 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2013 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 743 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 507 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 08 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material     purchase accounting for acquisitions     we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income     judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets          52             item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk     in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes     foreign currency exchange rate risk     a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business     we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency     for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 520 million and our pretax operating profit by 174 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2012 would have increased our revenue by 494 million and our pretax operating profit by 167 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2013 and 2012     on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2013 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2013 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2014 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2014 and rates could go either higher or lower     interest rate risk     our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2013 our weighted average cost of debt was 46 and weightedaverage life of debt was 93 years at december 31 2013 81 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 19 was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2013 interest expense by 28 million     based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other

consolidated entities are reported as noncontrolling interests we use the equity method of accounting for investments in which we are able to exercise significant influence and use the cost method for all other investments all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated     our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented therein certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not material     segments we manage our business and report our financial results through the following five reportable segments which are the same as operating segments            us consumer information solutions or uscis               international               workforce solutions               north america personal solutions               north america commercial solutions             63             notes to consolidated financial statements     uscis is our largest reportable segment with 44 of total operating revenue for 2013 our most significant foreign operations are located in canada and the uk     use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with gaap accordingly we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our consolidated financial statements are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made including the consideration of events that have occurred up until the point these consolidated financial statements have been filed these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from these estimates     revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relates to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes     if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met     the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a portion of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract     we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract          64             notes to consolidated financial statements     many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract     we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance     we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction     deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies     cost of services cost of services consist primarily of 1 data acquisition and royalty fees 2 customer service costs which include personnel costs to collect maintain and update our proprietary databases to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support 3 hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems 4 telecommunication and computer network expense and 5 occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by equifax employees     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs restructuring costs corporate costs fees for professional and consulting services advertising costs and other costs of administration     advertising advertising costs from continuing operations which are expensed as incurred totaled 575 million 487 million and 420 million during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively     stockbased compensation we recognize the cost of stockbased payment transactions in the financial statements over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stockbased awards issued all of our stockbased awards which are stock options and nonvested stock are classified as equity instruments    income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized     we record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates or when statutory terms expire changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur           65              notes to consolidated financial statements     earnings per share our basic earnings per share or eps is calculated as net income divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding the net income amounts used in both our basic and diluted eps calculations are the same a reconciliation of the weightedaverage outstanding shares used in the two calculations is as follows                 twelve months ended december 31                   2013         2012         2011                   in millions           weightedaverage shares outstanding basic             1212             1199             1219           effect of dilutive securities                                               stock options and restricted stock units             25             26             18           weightedaverage shares outstanding diluted             1237             1225             1237              for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 01 million 01 million and 23 million stock options respectively were antidilutive and therefore excluded from this calculation     cash equivalents we consider all highlyliquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents     trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we do not recognize interest income on our trade accounts receivable additionally we generally do not require collateral from our customers related to our trade accounts receivable     the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical writeoff experience an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition we reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense which are included in selling general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income bad debt expense from continuing operations was 28 million 21 million and 27 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively    longlived assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the cost of additions is capitalized property and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally three to ten years for data processing equipment and capitalized internaluse software and systems costs leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms that are reasonably assured buildings are depreciated over a fortyyear period other fixed assets are depreciated over three to seven years upon sale or retirement of an asset the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized and included in income from operations on the consolidated statements of income with the classification of any gain or loss dependent on the characteristics of the asset sold or retired     certain internaluse software and system development costs are capitalized accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the predefined user and operating performance requirements as established during the preliminary stage of an internaluse software development project costs incurred during a software development projects preliminary stage and postimplementation stage are expensed as incurred application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration development of interfaces coding testing and installation capitalized internaluse software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straightline basis over a three to tenyear period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use         66              notes to consolidated financial statements     depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property and equipment was 712 million 739 million and 731 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively     industrial revenue bonds pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 826 million and 707 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company     impairment of longlived assets we monitor the status of our longlived assets in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset group is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset groups ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize estimates of discounted future cash flows to determine the asset groups fair value we did not record any impairment losses of longlived assets in any of the periods presented     goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 each year    in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required for reporting units that we determine meet these criteria we perform a qualitative assessment in this qualitative assessment we consider the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that significantly exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not if it is determined it is not more likely than not no further testing is required if further testing is required we continue with the quantitative impairment test     in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then no further testing is required however if a reporting units fair value were to be less than its carrying value we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded its implied value          67              notes to consolidated financial statements     indefinitelived reacquired rights represent the value of rights which we had granted to various affiliate credit reporting agencies that were reacquired in the us and canada a portion of our reacquired rights are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite in accordance with the accounting guidance in place at the time of the acquisitions indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value our annual impairment test date is september 30 we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value     we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 and we determined that there was no impairment in any of these years    purchased intangible assets purchased intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer credit files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada we expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred we amortize purchased data files which primarily consist of acquired credit files on a straightline basis all of our other purchased intangible assets are also amortized on a straightline basis         asset         useful life                   in years           purchased data files         2 to 15           acquired software and technology         1 to 10           noncompete agreements         1 to 10           proprietary database

sciences corporation that were reacquired in connection with the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on the accounting guidance in place at that time these reacquired rights are being amortized over the remaining term of the affiliation agreement on a straightline basis from december 28 2012 to august 1 2018     other assets other assets on our consolidated balance sheets primarily represents our investment in unconsolidated affiliates our cost method investment in boa vista servicos bvs interest rate swaps assets related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company and employee benefit trust assets       impairment of cost method investment we monitor the status of our cost method investment in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that it may be impaired in that its carrying amount may exceed the fair value of the investment significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of the investment using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and an evaluation of ebitda and transaction multiples for comparable companies if the carrying value of the investment exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the investments carrying amount exceeds its fair value we recorded an impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 see note 2 for further discussion      benefit plans we sponsor various pension and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired us employees benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and for some pension plans benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and other postretirement plans     foreign currency translation the functional currency of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries is that subsidiarys local currency we translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the yearend rate of exchange and revenue and expenses at the monthly average rates during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment in other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 68 million of foreign currency transaction losses the amount was not material for the year ended december 31 2012     financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable accounts payable and short and longterm debt the carrying amounts of these items other than longterm debt approximate their fair market values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of our fixedrate debt is determined using level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for publicly traded instruments and for nonpublicly traded instruments through valuation techniques depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument taking into account credit risk as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of our fixedrate debt was 12 billion and 16 billion respectively compared to its carrying value of 11 billion and 15

are not utilized for speculative purposes or as the companys primary risk management tool derivatives have been used as a risk management tool to hedge the companys exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have used interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed and floatingrate borrowings forward contracts on various foreign currencies have been used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk of certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivative valuations reflect the value of the instrument including the value associated with any material counterparty risk     fair value hedges in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate and are recorded in interest expense the full fair value of the interest rate swap is classified as a noncurrent asset or liability as the remaining maturity of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge is more than twelve months there was no ineffectiveness on our fair value hedge that impacted current year earnings the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 60 million and 122 million respectively recorded in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets     cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of income in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings we did not have any unsettled cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2013 or december 31 2012     fair value measurements fair value is determined based on the assumptions marketplace participants use in pricing the asset or liability we use a three level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data eg a companys own data the adoption of fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements     the following table presents assets

investment selections and is valued at daily quoted market prices         variable interest entities we hold interests in certain entities including credit data and information solutions ventures that are considered variable interest entities or vies these variable interests relate to ownership interests that require financial support for these entities our investments related to these vies totaled 236 million at december 31 2013 representing our maximum exposure to loss these investments are classified in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets we are not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate any of these vies     recent accounting pronouncements testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in july 2012 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test under that option a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the company determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted we implemented the new standard in our 2013 annual impairment testing this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations     other comprehensive income in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income which requires public companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their annual and interim financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2013 and it did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations

recorded         during the fourth quarter of 2013 management of bvs updated financial projections in connection with a request for additional financing the financial projections reflected the effects of reduced nearterm market expectations for consumer credit and for credit information services in brazil and increased investment to achieve the strategic objectives and capitalize on future market opportunities such as positive data resulting in reduced expected cash flows the request for financing the projections received along with the nearterm weakness in the brazilian consumer and small

facility also has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to 10 billion borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs the senior credit facility is scheduled to expire in december 2017 availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes            75                       notes to consolidated financial statements     under our senior credit facility we must comply with various financial and nonfinancial covenants the

unused portion of the revolver and interest rate are subject to adjustment based on our debt ratings as of december 31 2013 7486 million was available for borrowings and there were no outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility which is included in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets     while the underlying final maturity date of this facility is december 2017 it is structured to provide borrowings under shortterm loans because these borrowings primarily have a maturity of ninety days the borrowings and repayments are presented on a net basis within the financing activities portion of our consolidated statements of cash flows as net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities     cp program our 7500 million cp program has been established through the private placement of cp notes from time to time in which borrowings bear interest at either a variable rate based on libor or other benchmarks or a fixed rate with the applicable rate and margin maturities of cp can range from overnight to 397 days because the cp program is backstopped by our senior credit facility the amount of cp which may be issued under the program is reduced by

 notes to consolidated financial statements     data processing outsourcing services and other agreements we have separate agreements with ibm tcs and others to outsource portions of our computer data processing operations applications development maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services the agreements expire between 2014 and 2019 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately 70 million as of december 31 2013 with no future years minimum contractual obligation expected to exceed approximately 40 million annual payment obligations in regard to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings acquisitions or divestitures the introduction of significant new technologies foreign currency or the general rate of inflation in certain circumstances eg a change in control or for our convenience we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay a significant penalty     during 2012 we amended certain portions and terminated certain other portions of our operations support services agreement for north america with ibm the amended agreement extends certain terms two years through december 2016 and changes certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company during 2011 we amended our operations support services agreement in north america with ibm the amended

covers our operations in north america europe and peru we have outsourced certain of our mainframe and midrange operations help desk service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks the scope of such services varies by location the estimated future minimum contractual obligation under the revised agreement is approximately 50 million for the remaining term with no individual years minimum expected to exceed approximately 30 million we may terminate certain portions of this agreement without penalty in the event that ibm is in material breach of the terms of the agreement during 2013 2012 and 2011 we paid 60 million 705 million and 797 million respectively for these services     change in control agreements we have entered into change in control severance agreements with certain key executives the agreements provide for among other things certain payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment ie termination of employment by the executive for good reason or termination of employment by the company without cause each as defined in the agreements following a change in control of the company in the event of a qualifying termination the executive will become entitled to continuation of group health dental vision life disability 401k and similar benefits for three years as well as a lump sum severance payment all of which differs by executive     the change in control agreements have a threeyear term and automatically renew for another three years unless we elect not to renew the agreements change in control events potentially triggering benefits under the agreements would occur subject to certain exceptions if 1 any person acquires 20 or more of our voting stock 2 upon a merger or other business combination our shareholders receive less than twothirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company 3 we sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or 4 we liquidate or dissolve     if these change in control agreements had been triggered as of december 31 2013 payments of approximately 544 million would have been made excluding tax grossup amounts of 361 million under the companys existing director and employee stock benefit plans a change in control generally would result in the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and satisfaction of the restrictions on any outstanding nonvested stock awards with respect to unvested performance based share awards dependent upon the companys threeyear relative total shareholder return if at least one calendar year of performance during the performance period has been completed prior to the change in control event the awards will be paid out based on the companys performance at that time otherwise the payout of shares will be at 100 of the target award             78                   notes to consolidated financial statements     guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is not material at december 31 2013 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2013     general indemnifications we are the lessee under many real estate leases it is common in these commercial lease transactions for us as the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises this type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of among others contractors licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises this indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct     certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations in certain of these credit agreements we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to nonus lenders to withholding taxes     in conjunction with certain transactions such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of certain assets or businesses we sometimes provide routine indemnifications the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited     the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations     we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we have no accrual related to indemnifications on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 and 2012     subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations the ability of some of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends     contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available we have recorded accruals in our consolidated financial statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated     although the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate however our evaluation of the likely impact of these matters may change in the future we accrue for unpaid legal fees for services performed to date             79                       notes to consolidated financial statements     tax matters in 2003 the canada revenue agency or cra issued notices of reassessment

respectively the accruals for potential interest and penalties during 2013 and 2012 were not material    equifax and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal state and international income taxes we are generally no longer subject to federal state or international income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008 due to the potential for resolution of state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations it is reasonably possible that equifaxs gross unrecognized tax benefit balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 60 million                in september 2013 the irs released final tangible property regulations under sections 162a and 263a of the internal revenue code regarding the deduction and capitalization of

twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively     benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an

2011 respectively    stock options the 2008 omnibus incentive plan provides that qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted to officers and other employees in conjunction with our acquisition of talx we assumed options outstanding under the legacy talx stock option plan which was approved by talx shareholders in addition stock options remain outstanding under three shareholderapproved plans and three nonshareholderapproved plans from which no new grants may be made the 2008 omnibus incentive plan requires that stock options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant generally stock options are subject to graded vesting for periods of up to three years based on service with 33 vesting for each year of completed service and expire ten years from the grant date     we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january 1 2006 the binomial model incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior expected stock price volatility dividend yield and riskfree interest rate anticipated employee exercise behavior and expected postvesting cancellations over the contractual term used in the binomial model were primarily based on historical exercise patterns these historical exercise patterns indicated there was not significantly different exercise behavior between employee groups for our expected stock price volatility assumption we weighted historical volatility and implied volatility we used daily observations for historical volatility while our implied volatility assumption was based on actively traded options related to our common stock the expected term is derived from the binomial model based on assumptions incorporated into the binomial model as described above     the fair value for stock options granted during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was estimated at the date of grant using the binomial model with the following weightedaverage assumptions                 twelve months ended december 31                   2013             2012             2011

board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders under the rights agreement as originally adopted in october 1995 and amended and restated in october 2005 holders of our common stock were granted one right to purchase common stock or right for each outstanding share of common stock held of record on november 24 1995 all newly issued shares of common stock since that date have been

allocation strategy of the plan is to produce a total investment return which will satisfy future annual cash benefit payments to participants and minimize future contributions from the company additionally this strategy will diversify the plan assets to minimize nonsystemic risk and provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of security will have a disproportionate impact on the plan investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of erisa standards of performance for each manager include an expected return versus an assigned benchmark a measure of volatility and a time period of evaluation     the asset allocation strategy is determined by our external advisor forecasting investment returns by asset class and providing allocation guidelines to maximize returns while minimizing the volatility and correlation of those returns investment recommendations are made by our external advisor working in conjunction with our inhouse investment officer the asset allocation and ranges are approved by inhouse investment fiduciaries and plan administrators who are named fiduciaries under erisa           93               notes to consolidated financial statements     the plan in an effort to meet asset allocation objectives utilizes a variety of asset classes which has historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the sampp 500 in most environments asset classes included in this category of alternative assets include hedge funds private equity including secondary private equity and real assets real estate funds of hard asset securities and private equity funds focused on real assets the primary benefits of using these types of asset classes are 1 their noncorrelated returns reduce the overall volatility of the plans portfolio of assets and 2 their ability to produce superior riskadjusted returns this has allowed the plans average annual investment return to exceed the sampp 500 index return over the last ten years additionally the plan allows certain of their managers subject to specific risk constraints to utilize derivative instruments in order to enhance asset return reduce volatility or both derivatives are primarily employed by the plans in their fixed income portfolios and in the hedge fundoffunds area derivatives can be used for hedging purposes to reduce risk     the plan is
