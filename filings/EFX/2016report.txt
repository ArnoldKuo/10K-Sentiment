modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services and recovery management businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has fixed the dates by which credit reference agencies and collection businesses must apply for this authorization debt collections services businesses were required to apply by june 30 2015 and credit reference agencies must apply by march 31 2016 the license application for our collection business tdx group or tdx was submitted prior to the june 30 2015 deadline and we expect to apply for authorization in our capacity as a credit reference agency by the march 31 2016 deadline although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the ukin europe we are subject to the european union eu data protection regulations including the comprehensive 1995 european union data protection directive the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security the eu standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries where equifax operates in the uk in addition to the eu directive on data protection the data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data in addition regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations in spain and portugal the privacy laws which are subject to the eu directive on data protection regulate all credit bureau and personal solutions activities regulation relating to the 1995 eu data protection directive proposed in 2012 by the european commission has now been agreed by the european legislative bodies that amongst other things will tighten data protection requirements and make enforcement more rigorous for example by streamlining enforcement at a european level introducing data breach notification requirements and increasing penalties for noncompliance it is anticipated that the regulation will be enacted in the spring of 2016 and will have a two year implementation periodin canada federal and provincial laws govern how we collect use or disclose personal information in the course of our commercial activities the federal personal information protection and electronic documents act of 2000 gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by us and requires compliance with the canadian standard association model code for the protection of personal information covering accountability and identifying purposes consent collection use disclosure retention accuracy safeguards individual access and compliance the federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention and provisions of canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned the european union or eu recognizes canada as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processingin latin america consumer reporting data protection and privacy laws and regulations exist in various forms in argentina chile costa rica ecuador el salvador paraguay peru and uruguay argentina and uruguay generally follow the eu data protection model and the eu recognizes both countries laws as providing adequate 12levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing data credit bureau andor consumer protection laws in paraguay and peru regulate issues such as consent collection use disclosure retention and accuracy of credit data among other protections laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal datalaws in argentina chile ecuador paraguay peru and uruguay also establish specific privacy rights and judicial proceedings may be used to enforce them legislation has been proposed in several countries in latin america that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be stored and create new access and notification rights for data subjects in argentina a privacy bill of law was also filed at the congress of buenos aires province this bill proposes the creation of a provincial registry of databases stricter regulations concerning notifications to data subjects and immediate updates of their credit files the chilean government has indicated that it will introduce a new comprehensive data protection bill in 2016 and a separate bill that would create a publiclymanaged consumer credit registry remains before the legislature each of these bills would introduce a new framework to allow the government to regulate the collection and use of personal data including credit data ecuadors national assembly approved a law to replace private sector credit bureaus with a staterun registry which when implemented would materially impact our local credit reporting operations in ecuador ecuador however represented less than one percent of our 2015 revenue and operating profit for our international business unit and is not material to our consolidated results of operations the law originally provided a transition period throughout 2013 for the development and introduction of the new registry however the transition period was then extended through 2014 in late 2014 the law was amended again to remove the fixed deadline allowing private sector credit bureaus to continue operating until the financial sector regulatory board determines that the new registry is operational to date the public body in ecuador in charge of the registry has not achieved a successful implementation in paraguay in december 2015 a modification was introduced to current data protection law requiring debts to be eliminated from a credit file once full payment has occurred in addition the amendment now permits the disclosure and use of positive data in peru there is a proposal to include certain thresholds under which delinquencies could not be reported and the obligation to send a notice prior to the registration of delinquencies legislation has been approved in el salvador to reduce the period of time during which credit information may be reported following the payment of a debt in addition to use share transfer or commercialize credit data without consent in el salvador is now a serious infraction and in the event that a credit bureau suspends or ceases operations a copy of its credit database must be provided to the regulator costa rica is in the process of amending current administrative regulations regarding data protection while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be materialin india various legislation including the information technology act 2000 and the credit information companies regulation act of 2005 establishes a federal data protection framework entities that collect and maintain personal data andor credit information must ensure that it is complete accurate and safeguarded and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting processing preserving sharing and using such data andor credit information the indian parliament has passed legislation that would allow individuals to sue for

business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well 15as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailableour markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell tribureau and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development processif we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 16we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner any significant delay or interruption could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputationsecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategydespite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events unauthorized access to data files or our information technology systems and applications could result in inappropriate use change or disclosure of sensitive andor personal data of our customers employees consumers and suppliers we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies including ours although we are not aware of any material breach of our data properties networks or systems if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us  under title x of the doddfrank act the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers the cfpb has oversight of the fcra the federal regulation most directly impacting us operations the cfpb is also charged with defining unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices known as udaap also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties during 2015 the cfpb 17publicly announced 50 enforcement actions imposing 2128 million in civil money penalties and ordering 19 billion in restitution and 6363 million in balance reductions we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k in the uk we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses we submitted a license application for our debt collection services businesses tdx prior to the june 30 2015 deadline and expect to apply for authorization in our capacity as a credit reference agencies by the march 31 2016 deadline although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actionsthese laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see item 1 business  government regulation in this form 10k we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted in addition the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results in january 2014 we acquired the tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses in addition as described in more detail in item 7 we have entered into an agreement to acquire veda which if completed will give us a significant presence in australia and new zealand where we do not currently have significant operations expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not 18materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or usthe demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and personal solutions business units in addition recently there has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost direct to consumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to premium products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated 19if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenueeconomic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations sales outside the us comprised 23 of our net operating revenue in 2015 and are expected to increase following the acquisition of veda as as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue particularly in anticipation of the veda acquisition in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors includingchanges in specific country or region political economic or other conditionstrade protection measuresdata privacy and consumer protection regulationsdifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operationsdiffering labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulationsbusiness licensing

portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in

of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase

healthcare government and auto verticals the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 757 million or 3 in 2015 compared to 2014 revenue for 2014 increased by 6 compared to 2013 the growth was driven by the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 tdx acquisition and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the growth was offset by the expected decline in mortgage market activity the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the relative improvement in mortgage activity in the us which declined in the second half of 2013 through 2014 but at a lesser rate

than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt the companys leverage ratio was 126 at december 31 2015 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2015 the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants41 the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 63 senior notes due 2017 33 senior notes due 2022 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the senior notes contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announce the companys intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest credit ratings  credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2015 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2014 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment for additional information about our debt including the terms of our financing arrangements basis for

related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2016 and 20234these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2016 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance5for future interest payments on variablerate debt which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2015 to calculate these payments our variable rate debt at december 31 2015 consisted of cp future interest payments related

time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2015 ranged from 065 to 075 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates6this table excludes 246 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the

dollars and debt assumed of approximately 1884 million 2615 million australian dollars we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as disclosed above refer to item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed acquisition of vedawe do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities43 pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1085 million and 923 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2015 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2015 benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011at december 31 2015 the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 02 million and 12 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this reportseasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highesteffects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability 44a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report application of critical accounting policies and estimates the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditionsrevenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been metthe determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our 45clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are metdeferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 46goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of us information solutions which includes part of online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services europe latin america canada personal solutions verification services and employer services based on the companys enterprisewide strategy weve consolidated the identity management reporting unit with the us information solutions reporting unit in 2015 we performed goodwill impairment tests prior to and following the consolidation for usis and identity management reporting units which resulted in no impairment the goodwill balance at december 31 2015 for our seven reporting units was as follows december 31 2015 in millionsus information solutions10713europe1873latin america2221canada321personal solutions1506verification services7386employer services1690total goodwill25710 qualitative assessmentswe performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for all of our reporting unitsloss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 47income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2015 246 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 94 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit costduring 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp2015 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015during 2014 the we adopted the new rp2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp2014 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this new table along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not materialwe determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2015 the us pension plan investment losses of 11 were below the expected return of 75 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is at 725 which is a reduction from the rate used for 2015 the crip earned 29 in 2015 which was below its expected return of 675 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the crip for 2016 is at 60 which is a reduction from 48the rate used for 2015 the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2016 is 712 which is slightly lower than the 2015 expected rate annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5433 million at december 31 2015 we do not expect our 2016 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2015 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 712 at december 31 2015 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 486 at december 31 2015 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 04 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets49item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency for the year ended december 31 2015 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2015 would have increased our revenue by 529 million and our pretax operating profit by 179 million for the year ended december 31 2014 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2014 would have increased our revenue by 540 million and our pretax operating profit by 181 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2015 and 2014 on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2015 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2015 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2016 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2016 and rates could go either higher or lowerthe veda cash consideration of approximately 17 billion 24 billion australian dollars is denominated in australian dollars and as such subject to fluctuations related to the exchange rate of the australian dollar a 001 increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the australian dollar results in a 242 million increase or decrease in the acquisition price in december 2015 in anticipation of the veda acquisition we purchased foreign currency options to buy australian dollars with a weighted average strike price of 07225 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars these foreign currency options options were designed to act as economic hedges for the pending veda acquisition and are marked to market in january 2016 we purchased additional options with a weighted average strike price of 07091 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars we closed out all of the options on the respective settlement dates in february 2016 we recognized a net loss of 154 million related to the options in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 for further discussion interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2015 our weighted average cost of debt was 45 and weightedaverage life of debt was 907 years at december 31 2015 96 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 4 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2015 interest expense by 05 million50 based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have limited exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors51item 8

basis of consolidation  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap include equifax and all its subsidiaries we consolidate all majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary other parties interests in consolidated entities are reported as noncontrolling interests we use the equity method of accounting for investments in which we are able to exercise significant influence and use the cost method for all other investments all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented therein  segments  we manage our business and report our financial results through the following four reportable segments which are our operating segments us information solutions or usisinternationalworkforce solutionspersonal solutions usis is our largest reportable segment with 44 of total operating revenue for 2015 our most significant foreign operations are located in the uk and canada 61notes to consolidated financial statementsuse of estimates  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with gaap accordingly we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our consolidated financial statements are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made including the consideration of events that have occurred up until the point these consolidated financial statements have been filed these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from these estimates revenue recognition and deferred revenue  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relates to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a portion of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 62notes to consolidated financial statementswe have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transactionthe debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policiescost of services  cost of services consist primarily of 1 data acquisition and royalty fees 2 customer service costs which include personnel costs to collect maintain and update our proprietary databases to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support 3 hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems 4 telecommunication and computer network expense and 5 occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by equifax employees selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs restructuring costs corporate costs fees for professional and consulting services advertising costs and other costs of administration advertising  advertising costs from continuing operations which are expensed as incurred totaled 651 million 571 million and 575 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively stockbased compensation  we recognize the cost of stockbased payment transactions in the financial statements over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stockbased awards issued all of our stockbased awards which are stock options and nonvested stock are classified as equity instruments income taxes  we account for income taxes under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized we record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates or when statutory terms expire changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur earnings per share  our basic earnings per share or eps is calculated as net income divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding the net income amounts used in both our basic and diluted eps calculations are the same a reconciliation of the weightedaverage outstanding shares used in the two calculations is as follows twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 2013 in millionsweightedaverage shares outstanding basic1187 1212 1212effect of dilutive securities     stock options and

01 million and 01 million stock options respectively were antidilutive and therefore excluded from this calculation accelerated share repurchase program  on october 24 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr program to repurchase shares of our common stock under our approved share repurchase program under the asr program the number of shares to be repurchased is based generally on the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr program on october 24 2014 we paid 115 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 14 million shares to us subject to a 10 or 115 million holdback the maximum number of shares to be received or delivered under the contracts was 32 millionthe asr program was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction and a forward stock purchase contract the initial repurchase of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weightedaverage common shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share on the effective date of the agreement the forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments under asc 81540 for contracts in entitys own equity and were deemed to have a fair value of zero at the effective date on february 4 2015 we settled the asr and received approximately 002 million sharescash equivalents  we consider all highlyliquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  we do not recognize interest income on our trade accounts receivable additionally we generally do not require collateral from our customers related to our trade accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical writeoff experience an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition we reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense which are included in selling general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income bad debt expense from continuing operations was 43 million 25 million and 28 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively other current assets  other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets includes amounts in specifically designated accounts that hold the funds that are due to customers from our debt collection and recovery management services as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these assets were approximately 302 million and 508 million with fully offsetting balances in other current liabilities these amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements other current assets also include foreign currency options receivables related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company deferred charges as well as certain current tax accounts longlived assets  property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the cost of additions is capitalized property and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally three to ten years for data processing equipment and capitalized internaluse software and systems costs leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms that are reasonably assured buildings are depreciated over a fortyyear period other fixed assets are depreciated over three to seven years upon sale or retirement of an asset the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized and included in income from operations on the consolidated statements of income with the classification of any gain or loss dependent on the characteristics of the asset sold or retired certain internaluse software and system development costs are capitalized accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the predefined user and operating performance requirements as established during the preliminary stage of an internaluse software development project costs incurred during a software development projects preliminary stage and postimplementation stage are expensed as incurred application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration development of interfaces coding testing and installation capitalized internaluse software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straightline basis over a three to tenyear period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use 64notes to consolidated financial statementsdepreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property and equipment was 757 million 717 million and 712 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively industrial revenue bonds  pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1085 million and 923 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company impairment of longlived assets  we monitor the status of our longlived assets in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset group is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset groups ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize estimates of discounted future cash flows to determine the asset groups fair value we did not record any impairment losses of longlived assets in any of the periods presented goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 each year under asc 350 we have an option to perform a qualitative assessment of our reporting units to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required for reporting units that we determine meet these criteria we perform a qualitative assessment in this qualitative assessment we consider the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that significantly exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not if it is determined it is not more likely than not no further testing is required if further testing is required we continue with the quantitative impairment test in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then no further testing is required however if a reporting units fair value were to be less than its carrying value we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded its implied value indefinitelived reacquired rights represent the value of rights which we had granted to various affiliate credit reporting agencies that were reacquired in the us and canada a portion of our reacquired rights are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite in accordance with the accounting guidance in place at the time of the acquisitions indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value our annual impairment test date is september 30 we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if the qualitative assessment indicates that we need to perform a quantitative impairment test we compare the assets fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value65notes to consolidated financial statements we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 and we determined that there was no impairment in any of these years purchased intangible assets  purchased intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer credit files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada we expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred we amortize purchased data

represent the value of rights which we had granted to computer sciences corporation that were reacquired in connection with the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 based on the accounting guidance in place at that time these reacquired rights are being amortized over the remaining term of the affiliation agreement on a straightline basis until august 1 2018 other assets  other assets on our consolidated balance sheets primarily represents our investment in unconsolidated affiliates our cost method investment in boa vista servicos bvs assets related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company employee benefit trust assets and debt issuance costsimpairment of cost method investment we monitor the status of our cost method investment in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that it may be impaired in that its carrying amount may exceed the fair value of the investment significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of the investment using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and an evaluation of ebitda and transaction multiples for comparable companies if the carrying value of the investment exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the investments carrying amount exceeds its fair value there were no indicators of impairment for 2014 we recorded an impairment of our cost method investment in 2015 and 2013 see note 2 for further discussion other current liabilities  other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets consist of the offset to other current assets related to amounts in specifically designated accounts that hold the funds that are due to customers from our debt collection and recovery management services these funds were approximately 302 million and 508 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements other current liabilities also include various accrued expenses such as interest expense accrued employee benefits accrued taxes accrued payroll and accrued legal expensesbenefit plans  we sponsor various pension and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired us employees benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and for some pension plans benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and other postretirement plans foreign currency translation  the functional currency of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries is that subsidiarys local currency we translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the yearend rate of exchange and revenue and expenses at the monthly average rates during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment in other 66notes to consolidated financial statementscomprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded 20 million of foreign currency transaction gains in the year ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 we recorded 70 million and 68 million of foreign currency transaction losses respectively financial instruments  our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable accounts payable and short and longterm debt the carrying amounts of these items other than longterm debt approximate their fair market values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of our fixedrate debt is determined using level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for publicly traded instruments and for nonpublicly traded instruments through valuation techniques depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument taking into account credit risk as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the fair value of our fixedrate debt was 12 billion and 13 billion respectively compared to its carrying value of 11 billion and 11 billion respectively based on recent trading prices derivatives and hedging activities  although derivative financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes or as the companys primary risk management tool derivatives have been used as a risk management tool to hedge the companys exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have used interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed and floatingrate borrowings forward contracts on various foreign currencies have been used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk of certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivative valuations reflect the value of the instrument including the value associated with any material counterparty risk economic hedges  in december 2015 in anticipation of the veda acquisition we purchased foreign currency options to buy australian dollars with a weighted average strike price of 07225 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars these foreign currency options options were designed to act as economic hedges for the pending veda acquisition and have been marked to market the options have an expiry date of february 18 2016 and are reflected in other current assets net on our consolidated balance sheet we recorded a marktomarket gain on the options of 47 million for the year ended december 31 2015 which was recorded in other income expense net the fair value of these options at december 31 2015 were 144 million recorded in other current assets net on our consolidated balance sheet in january 2016 we purchased additional options for a notional amount of 10 billion australian dollars with a weighted average strike price of 07091 with expiry dates of february 11 2016 and february 16 2016 we closed out all of the options on the respective settlement dates in february 2016 we recognized a net loss of 154 million related to the options in the first quarter of 2016 which was recorded in other income expense netfair value hedges  in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate and are recorded in interest expense we settled the interest rate swaps on their maturity date during the fourth quarter of 2014 with receipt of 38 million from the counterparties there was no ineffectiveness on our fair value hedge that impacted 2014 earnings cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of income in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings we did not have any unsettled cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2015 or december 31 2014 fair value measurements  fair value is determined based on the assumptions marketplace participants use in pricing the asset or liability we use a three level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data eg a companys own data the adoption of fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis67notes to consolidated financial statements     fair value measurements at reporting date

compensation and commissions until a later date based on the terms of the plans the liability representing benefits accrued for plan participants is valued at the quoted market prices of the participants investment elections the asset consists of mutual funds reflective of the participants investment selections and is valued at daily quoted market pricesvariable interest entities  we hold interests in certain entities including credit data information solutions and debt collections and recovery management ventures that are considered variable interest entities or vies these variable interests relate to ownership interests that require financial support for these entities our investments related to these vies totaled 105 million at december 31 2015 representing our maximum exposure to loss with the exception of the guarantees referenced in note 7 we are not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate any of these vies with the exception of a debt collections and recovery management venture for which we meet the consolidation criteria under asc 810 in regards to that consolidated vie we have a 75 equity ownership interest and control of the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance the assets and liabilities of the vie for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the companys consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss was recognized because of its consolidationin evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact its economic performance we consider the purpose for which the vie was created the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decisionmaking role if any in those activities that significantly determine the entitys economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders this evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decisionmaking that affects the entitys future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decisionmaking rights are most importantin determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity regardless of form debt equity management and servicing fees and other contractual arrangements this evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entitys design including the entitys capital structure contractual rights to earnings losses subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors contingent payments as well as other contractual arrangements that have the potential to be economically significant the evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgmentcertain of our vies have redeemable noncontrolling interests that are subject to classification outside of permanent equity on the companys consolidated balance sheet the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reflected using the redemption method as of the balance sheet date redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustments to the redemption values are reflected in retained earnings the adjustment of redemption value at the period end that reflects a redemption value in excess of fair value is included as an adjustment to net income attributable to equifax stockholders for the purposes of the calculation of earnings per share none of the current period adjustments reflect a redemption in excess of fair value additionally due to the immaterial balance of the redeemable noncontrolling interest we have elected to maintain the noncontrolling interest in permanent equity rather than temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheetchange in accounting principle in november 2015 the fasb issued

this investment is recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets and is accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2012 our investment in bvs was valued at 130 million brazilian reais which was the same as the initial fair value the initial fair value was determined by a thirdparty using income market and transaction approaches 69notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of 2013 management of bvs updated financial projections in connection with a request for additional financing the financial projections reflected the effects of reduced nearterm market expectations for consumer credit and for credit information services in brazil and increased investment to achieve the strategic objectives and capitalize on future market opportunities such as positive data resulting in reduced expected cash flows the request for financing the projections received along with the nearterm weakness in the brazilian consumer and small commercial credit markets were considered indicators of impairment management of equifax performed an analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment at december 31 2013 and estimated that value to be 90 million reais 382 million as a result we wrotedown the carrying value of our investment and recorded a loss of 40 million reais 170 million which is included in other income expense in the

goodwill impairment tests as of september 30 each year the fair value estimates for our reporting units were determined using a combination of the income and market approaches in accordance with the companys methodology our annual impairment tests as of september 30 2015 2014 and 2013 resulted in no impairment of goodwill in 2015 the personal solutions business in the united kingdom was

in the table above data processing outsourcing services and other agreements  we have separate agreements with ibm tata consultancy services and others to outsource portions of our computer data processing operations applications development business continuity and recovery services help desk service and desktop support functions operation of our voice and data networks maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services the agreements expire between 2016 and 2023 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately 55 million as of december 31 2015 with no future years minimum contractual obligation expected to exceed approximately 35 million annual payment obligations in regard to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings acquisitions or 75notes to consolidated financial statementsdivestitures the introduction of significant new technologies foreign currency or the general rate of inflation in certain circumstances eg a change in control or for our convenience we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay significant termination fees during 2012 we amended certain portions and terminated certain other portions of our operations support services agreement for north america with ibm the amended agreement extends certain terms through december 2016 and changes certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company in 2015 we further amended our ibm agreement to extend our commitment for services provided in the us to 2020 under our agreement with ibm which covers our operations in north america and europe we have outsourced certain of our mainframe and midrange operations help desk service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks the scope of services provided by ibm and the term of our agreement with respect to such services varies by geography and location the estimated future minimum contractual obligation under the revised north america us and canada agreements is approximately 30 million for the remaining term with no individual years minimum expected to exceed approximately 20 million we may terminate certain portions of this agreement without penalty in the event that ibm is in material breach of the terms of the agreement during 2015 2014 and 2013 we paid approximately 50 million 50 million and 60 million respectively for these services change in control agreements  we have entered into change in control severance agreements with certain key executives the agreements provide for among other things certain payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment ie termination of employment by the executive for good reason or termination of employment by the company without cause each as defined in the agreements following a change in control of the company in the event of a qualifying termination the executive will become entitled to continuation of group health dental vision life disability 401k and similar benefits for two or three years depending on the eligibility as well as a lump sum severance payment all of which differs by executive  the change in control agreements have a threeyear term and automatically renew for another three years unless we elect not to renew the agreements change in control events potentially triggering benefits under the agreements would occur subject to certain exceptions if 1 any person acquires 20 or more of our voting stock 2 upon a merger or other business combination our shareholders receive less than twothirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company 3 we sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or 4 we liquidate or dissolve if these change in control agreements had been triggered as of december 31 2015 payments of approximately 547 million would have been made excluding tax grossup amounts of 308 million under the companys existing director and employee stock benefit plans a change in control generally would result in the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and satisfaction of the restrictions on any outstanding nonvested stock awards with respect to unvested performance based share awards dependent upon the companys threeyear relative total shareholder return if at least one calendar year of performance during the performance period has been completed prior to the change in control event the awards will be paid out based on the companys performance at that time otherwise the payout of shares will be at 100 of the target award  guarantees  we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is not material at december 31 2015 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less we may issue other guarantees in ordinary course of business the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2015 we have agreed to guarantee the liabilities and performance obligations some of which have limitations of a certain debt collections and recovery management vie under its commercial agreements we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the guarantees and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we had no accruals related to guarantees on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015 general indemnifications  we are the lessee under many real estate leases it is common in these commercial lease transactions for us as the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises this type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of among others contractors licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises this indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations in certain of 76notes to consolidated financial statementsthese credit agreements we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to nonus lenders to withholding taxes in conjunction with certain transactions such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of certain assets or businesses we sometimes provide routine indemnifications the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we have no accrual related to indemnifications on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2015 and 2014 subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations  the ability of some of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends contingencies  we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available we have recorded accruals in our consolidated financial statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  although the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate however our evaluation of the likely impact of these matters may change in the future we accrue for unpaid legal fees for services performed to date8 income taxes the provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the

talx we assumed options outstanding under the legacy talx stock option plan which was approved by talx shareholders in addition stock options remain outstanding under three shareholderapproved plans and three nonshareholderapproved plans from which no new grants may be made the 2008 omnibus incentive plan requires that stock options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant generally stock options are subject to graded vesting for periods of up to three years based on service with 33 vesting for each year of completed service and expire ten years from the grant date we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january 1 2006 the binomial model incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior expected stock price volatility dividend yield and riskfree interest rate anticipated employee exercise behavior and expected postvesting cancellations over the contractual term used in the binomial model were primarily based on historical exercise patterns these historical exercise patterns indicated there was not significantly different exercise behavior between employee groups for our expected stock price volatility assumption we weighted historical volatility and implied volatility we used daily observations for historical volatility while our implied volatility assumption was based on actively traded options related to our common stock the expected term is derived from the binomial model based on assumptions incorporated into the binomial model as described above the fair value for stock options granted during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was estimated at the date of grant using the binomial model with the following weightedaverage assumptions

provides for awards of nonvested shares of our common stock that can be granted to executive officers employees and directors nonvested stock awards are generally subject to cliff vesting over a period between one to three years based on service the fair value of nonvested stock is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant however since our nonvested stock does not accrue or pay dividends during the vesting period the fair value on the date of grant is reduced by the present value of the expected dividends over the requisite service period discounted using the appropriate riskfree interest ratepursuant to our 2008 omnibus incentive plan certain executive officers are granted nonvested shares in which the number of shares is dependent upon the companys

available as of the measurement date discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan expected return on plan assets  the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2015 our us pension plan investment losses of 11 were below the expected return of 75 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is 725 which is a reduction from the rate used in 2015 the crip earned 29 in 2015 which was below its expected return of 675 for the second time in seven years the expected return for the crip for 2016 is 60 which is a reduction from the rate used in 2015 the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities the calculation of the net

future annual cash benefit payments to participants and minimize future contributions from the company additionally this strategy will diversify the plan assets to minimize nonsystemic risk and provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of security will have a disproportionate impact on the plan investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of erisa standards of performance for each manager include an expected return versus an assigned benchmark a measure of volatility and a time period of evaluation the asset allocation strategy is determined by our external advisor forecasting investment returns by asset class and providing allocation guidelines to maximize returns while minimizing the volatility and correlation of those returns investment recommendations are made by our external advisor working in conjunction with our inhouse investment committee the asset allocation and ranges are approved by inhouse investment fiduciaries and plan administrators who are named fiduciaries under erisa the plan in an effort to meet asset allocation objectives utilizes a variety of asset classes which has historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the sampp 500 in most environments asset classes included in this category of alternative assets include hedge funds private equity including secondary private equity and real assets real estate funds of hard asset securities and private equity funds focused on real assets the primary benefits of using these types of asset classes are 1 their noncorrelated returns reduce the overall volatility of the plans portfolio of assets and 2 their ability to produce superior riskadjusted returns additionally the plan allows certain of their managers subject to specific risk constraints to utilize derivative instruments in order to enhance asset return reduce volatility or both derivatives are primarily employed by the plans in their fixed income portfolios
