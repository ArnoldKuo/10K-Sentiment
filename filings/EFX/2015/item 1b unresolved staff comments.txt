late 2014 the law was amended again to remove the fixed deadline allowing private sector credit bureaus to continue operating until the financial sector regulatory board determines that the new registry is operational legislation has also been proposed in argentina and uruguay that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be used and create new access and notification rights for data subjects the argentinean legislation has not proceeded beyond the introductory debate stage legislation has been proposed in el salvador to reduce the period of time during which credit information may be reported to prohibit including consumer addresses in credit reports and to regulate scoring the impact of the proposals is unlikely to have a material impact on our overall international operations but could significantly restrict operations in the local market costa rica is finalizing regulations that will be issued under its data protection legislation while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be materialin india various legislation including the information technology act 2000 and the credit information companies regulation

contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us although there has been some improvement in overall global macroeconomic conditions in 2014 we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 15the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailableour markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell tribureau and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process16security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategydespite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection the fair credit reporting act fcra regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer report information by banks and other companies these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us for example new data protection regulations currently being considered by the european union eu legislative bodies propose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to noneu countries reliance on express consent from data subjects as opposed to assumed or implied consent a right to require data processors to delete personal data and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms under title x of the doddfrank act the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers the cfpb has oversight of the fair credit reporting act as amended fcra the federal regulation most directly impacting us operations the cfpb is also charged with defining unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices known as udaap also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties during 2014 the cfpb announced more than 23 enforcement actions and imposed more than 1126 million in civil penalties and nearly 18 billion in restitution we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k 17in the uk we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has fixed the dates by which credit reference agencies and collection businesses must apply for this authorization credit reference agencies must apply by march 31 2016 and debt collections services businesses must apply by june 30 2015 we are preparing to submit a license application for our collection business tdx by june 30 2015 although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actionsthese laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see item 1 business  government regulation in this form 10k we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results in january 2014 we acquired the tdx group tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses we also completed the integration of the credit services business and assets we acquired from csc credit services inc on december 28 2012 for 10 billion expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 18dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or usthe demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and personal solutions business units to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these public sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 19third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenueeconomic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations sales outside the us comprised 26 of our net operating revenue in 2014 and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors includingchanges in specific country or region political economic or other conditionstrade protection measuresdata privacy and consumer protection regulationsdifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operationsdiffering labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulationsbusiness licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictionsdifficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient mannerimplementation of exchange controlsgeopolitical instability including terrorism and war andforeign currency changes20we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2014 a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see segment financial results  international  latin america and  canada consumer and effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the managements discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the companys ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on december 19 2017 the credit agreement and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit agreement negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operationschanges in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 21changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax lawswe are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business item 1b unresolved staff comments
