 in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency for the year ended december 31 2014 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 540 million and our pretax operating profit by 181 million for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 520 million and our pretax operating profit by 174 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2014 and 2013 on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2014 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2013 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2014 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2014 and rates could go either higher or lower interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2014 our weighted average cost of debt was 43 and weightedaverage life of debt was 79 years at december 31 2014 75 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 25 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2014 interest expense by 38 million based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors52
