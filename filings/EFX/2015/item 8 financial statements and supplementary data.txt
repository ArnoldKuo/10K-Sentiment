accompanying notes which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap include equifax and all its subsidiaries we consolidate all majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary other parties interests in consolidated entities are reported as noncontrolling interests we use the equity method of accounting for investments in which we are able to exercise significant influence and use the cost method for all other investments all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented therein certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not material segments  we manage our business and report our financial results through the following four reportable segments which are our operating segments us information solutions or usisinternationalworkforce solutionsnorth america personal solutions usis is our largest reportable segment with 45 of total operating revenue for 2014 our most significant foreign operations are located in canada and the uk 62notes to consolidated financial statementsuse of estimates  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with gaap accordingly we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our consolidated financial statements are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made including the consideration of events that have occurred up until the point these consolidated financial statements have been filed these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from these estimates revenue recognition and deferred revenue  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relates to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a portion of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 63notes to consolidated financial statementswe have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transactionthe debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policiescost of services  cost of services consist primarily of 1 data acquisition and royalty fees 2 customer service costs which include personnel costs to collect maintain and update our proprietary databases to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support 3 hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems 4 telecommunication and computer network expense and 5 occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by equifax employees selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs restructuring costs corporate costs fees for professional and consulting services advertising costs and other costs of administration advertising  advertising costs from continuing operations which are expensed as incurred totaled 571 million 575 million and 487 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively stockbased compensation  we recognize the cost of stockbased payment transactions in the financial statements over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stockbased awards issued all of our stockbased awards which are stock options and nonvested stock are classified as equity instruments income taxes  we account for income taxes under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized we record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates or when statutory terms expire changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur earnings per share  our basic earnings per share or eps is calculated as net income divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding the net income amounts used in both our basic and diluted eps

therefore excluded from this calculation accelerated share repurchase program  on october 24 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr program to repurchase shares of our common stock under our approved share repurchase program under the asr program the number of shares to be repurchased is based generally on the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr program on october 24 2014 we paid 115 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 14 million shares to us subject to a 10 or 115 million holdback the maximum number of shares to be received or delivered under the contracts is 32 millionthe asr program is accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction and a forward stock purchase contract the initial repurchase of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weightedaverage common shares outstanding for basic and diluted net income per share on the effective date of the agreement the forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments under asc 81540 for contracts in entitys own equity and were deemed to have a fair value of zero at the effective date on february 4 2015 we settled the asr and received approximately 002 million sharescash equivalents  we consider all highlyliquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  we do not recognize interest income on our trade accounts receivable additionally we generally do not require collateral from our customers related to our trade accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical writeoff experience an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition we reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense which are included in selling general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income bad debt expense from continuing operations was 25 million 28 million and 21 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively other current assets  other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets primarily represent amounts in specifically designated accounts that hold the funds that are due to customers from our debt collection and recovery management services as of december 31 2014 these assets were approximately 508 million with fully offsetting balance in other current liabilities these amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements there were no such restricted balances included in other current assets as of december 31 2013 other current assets also include receivables related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company as well as certain current tax accounts longlived assets  property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the cost of additions is capitalized property and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally three to ten years for data processing equipment and capitalized internaluse software and systems costs leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms that are reasonably assured buildings are depreciated over a fortyyear period other fixed assets are depreciated over three to seven years upon sale or retirement of an asset the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized and included in income from operations on the consolidated statements of income with the classification of any gain or loss dependent on the characteristics of the asset sold or retired 65notes to consolidated financial statementscertain internaluse software and system development costs are capitalized accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the predefined user and operating performance requirements as established during the preliminary stage of an internaluse software development project costs incurred during a software development projects preliminary stage and postimplementation stage are expensed as incurred application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration development of interfaces coding testing and installation capitalized internaluse software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straightline basis over a three to tenyear period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property and equipment was 717 million 712 million and 739 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively industrial revenue bonds  pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 923 million and 826 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company impairment of longlived assets  we monitor the status of our longlived assets in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset group is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset groups ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize estimates of discounted future cash flows to determine the asset groups fair value we did not record any impairment losses of longlived assets in any of the periods presented goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 each year in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required for reporting units that we determine meet these criteria we perform a qualitative assessment in this qualitative assessment we consider the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that significantly exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not if it is determined it is not more likely than not no further testing is required if further testing is required we continue with the quantitative impairment test 66notes to consolidated financial statementsin analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then no further testing is required however if a reporting units fair value were to be less than its carrying value we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded its implied value indefinitelived reacquired rights represent the value of rights which we had granted to various affiliate credit reporting agencies that were reacquired in the us and canada a portion of our reacquired rights are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite in accordance with the accounting guidance in place at the time of the acquisitions indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value our annual impairment test date is september 30 we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if the qualitative assessment indicates that we need to perform a quantitative impairment test we compare the assets fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 and we determined that there was no impairment in any of these years purchased intangible assets  purchased intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer credit files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada we expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred we amortize purchased data files

accounting guidance in place at that time these reacquired rights are being amortized over the remaining term of the affiliation agreement on a straightline basis until august 1 2018 other assets  other assets on our consolidated balance sheets primarily represents our investment in unconsolidated affiliates our cost method investment in boa vista servicos bvs interest rate swaps assets related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company and employee benefit trust assets 67notes to consolidated financial statementsimpairment of cost method investment we monitor the status of our cost method investment in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that it may be impaired in that its carrying amount may exceed the fair value of the investment significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of the investment using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and an evaluation of ebitda and transaction multiples for comparable companies if the carrying value of the investment exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the investments carrying amount exceeds its fair value there were no indicators of impairment for 2014 we recorded an impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 see note 2 for further discussion other current liabilities  other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets consist of the offset to other current assets related to amounts in specifically designated accounts that hold the funds that are due to customers from our debt collection and recovery management services as of december 31 2014 these funds were approximately 508 million these amounts are restricted as to their current use and will be released according to the specific customer agreements there were no such restricted balances included in other current liabilities as of december 31 2013 other current liabilities also include various accrued expenses such as interest expense accrued employee benefits accrued taxes accrued payroll and accrued legal expensesbenefit plans  we sponsor various pension and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired us employees benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and for some pension plans benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and other postretirement plans foreign currency translation  the functional currency of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries is that subsidiarys local currency we translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the yearend rate of exchange and revenue and expenses at the monthly average rates during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment in other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded 70 million of foreign currency transaction losses in the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 68 million of foreign currency transaction losses financial instruments  our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable accounts payable and short and longterm debt the carrying amounts of these items other than longterm debt approximate their fair market values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of our fixedrate debt is determined using level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for publicly traded instruments and for nonpublicly traded instruments through valuation techniques depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument taking into account credit risk as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of our fixedrate debt was 13 billion and 12 billion respectively compared to its carrying value of 11 billion and 11 billion respectively based on recent trading prices derivatives and hedging activities  although derivative financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes or as the companys primary risk management tool derivatives have been used as a risk management tool to hedge the companys exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have used interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed and floatingrate borrowings forward contracts on various foreign currencies have been used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk of certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivative valuations reflect the value of the instrument including the value associated with any material counterparty risk fair value hedges  in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate and are recorded in interest expense we settled the interest rate swaps on their maturity date during the fourth quarter of 2014 with receipt of 38 million from the counterparties there was no ineffectiveness on our fair value hedge that impacted current year earnings the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december 31 2013 was 60 million recorded in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets68notes to consolidated financial statementscash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of income in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings we did not have any unsettled cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2014 or december 31 2013 fair value measurements  fair value is determined based on the assumptions marketplace participants use in pricing the asset or liability we use a three level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data eg a companys own data the adoption of fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

elections the asset consists of mutual funds reflective of the participants investment selections and is valued at daily quoted market pricesvariable interest entities  we hold interests in certain entities including credit data and information solutions ventures that are considered variable interest entities or vies these variable interests relate to ownership interests that require financial support for these entities our investments related to these vies totaled 159 million at december 31 2014 representing our maximum exposure to loss these investments are classified in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets we are not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate any of these vies recent accounting pronouncements  discontinued operations in april 2014 the

intangible assets for impairment in july 2012 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 20122 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test under that option a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the company determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 we implemented the new standard in our 2013 annual impairment testing this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

an effect on our financial condition or results of operations2 cost method investment we hold a 15 equity interest in bvswhich is the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil this investment is recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets and is accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2012 our investment in bvs was valued at 130 million brazilian reais which is the same as the initial fair value the initial fair value was determined by a thirdparty using income and market approaches   during the fourth quarter of 2013 management of bvs updated financial projections in connection with a request for additional financing the financial projections reflected the effects of reduced nearterm market expectations for consumer credit and for credit information services in brazil and increased investment to achieve the strategic objectives and capitalize on future market opportunities such as positive data resulting in reduced expected cash flows the request for financing the projections received along with the nearterm weakness in the brazilian consumer and small commercial credit markets were considered indicators of impairment management of equifax prepared an analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment at december 31 2013 and estimated that value to be 90 million reais 382 million as a result we wrotedown the carrying value of our investment and recorded a loss of 40 million reais 170 million which is included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of income  at december 31 2014 we estimated the fair value of the investment approximated the fair value of the investment recorded3 discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2013 we divested of two nonstrategic business lines equifax settlement services which was part of our mortgage business within the usis operating segment and talent management services which was part of our employer services

assets acquired in a business combination as discussed in note 1 goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of september 30 each year the fair value estimates for our reporting units were determined using a combination of the income and market approaches in accordance with the companys methodology our annual impairment tests as of september 30 2014 2013 and 2012 resulted in no impairment of goodwill on july 1 2014 the north america commercial solutions operating segment was consolidated into the us consumer information

commercial solutions nacs operating segment was consolidated into the us consumer information solutions operating segment the combined operating segment was renamed us information solutions the canadian portion of the nacs operating segment was consolidated into the canada operations of the international operating segment to reflect this new organizational structure we have reallocated goodwill from nacs reporting unit to us information solutions and canada reporting units based on the relative fair values of the respectiveportions of nacs in accordance with asc 350 when reporting units are changed asc 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment during the third quarter of 2014 we performed our goodwill impairment test prior to and following the reallocation of goodwill

services and other agreements  we have separate agreements with ibm tata consultancy services and others to outsource portions of our computer data processing operations applications development maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services the agreements expire between 2015 and 2023 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately 60 million as of december 31 2014 with no future years minimum contractual obligation expected to exceed approximately 40 million annual payment obligations in regard to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings acquisitions or divestitures the introduction of significant new technologies foreign currency or the general rate of inflation in certain circumstances eg a change in control or for our convenience we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay a significant penalty during 2012 we amended certain portions and terminated certain other portions of our operations support services agreement for north america with ibm the amended agreement extends certain terms two years through december 2016 and changes certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company under our agreement with ibm which covers our operations in north america europe and peru we have outsourced certain of our mainframe and midrange operations help desk service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks the scope of such services varies by location the estimated future minimum contractual obligation under the revised agreement is approximately 25 million for the remaining term with no individual years minimum expected to exceed approximately 15 million we may terminate certain portions of this agreement without penalty in the event that ibm is in material breach of the terms of the agreement during 2014 2013 and 2012 we paid approximately 50 million 60 million and 70 million respectively for these services change in control agreements  we have entered into change in control severance agreements with certain key executives the agreements provide for among other things certain payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment ie termination of employment by the executive for good reason or termination of employment by the company without cause each as defined in the agreements following a change in control of the company in the event of a qualifying termination the executive will become entitled to continuation of group health dental vision life disability 401k and similar benefits for three years as well as a lump sum severance payment all of which differs by executive  the change in control agreements have a threeyear term and automatically renew for another three years unless we elect not to renew the agreements change in control events potentially triggering benefits under the agreements would occur subject to certain exceptions if 1 any person acquires 20 or more of our voting stock 2 upon a merger or other business combination our shareholders receive less than twothirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company 3 we sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or 4 we liquidate or dissolve77notes to consolidated financial statements if these change in control agreements had been triggered as of december 31 2014 payments of approximately 565 million would have been made excluding tax grossup amounts of 318 million under the companys existing director and employee stock benefit plans a change in control generally would result in the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and satisfaction of the restrictions on any outstanding nonvested stock awards with respect to unvested performance based share awards dependent upon the companys threeyear relative total shareholder return if at least one calendar year of performance during the performance period has been completed prior to the change in control event the awards will be paid out based on the companys performance at that time otherwise the payout of shares will be at 100 of the target award  guarantees  we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is not material at december 31 2014 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2014 general indemnifications  we are the lessee under many real estate leases it is common in these commercial lease transactions for us as the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises this type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of among others contractors licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises this indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations in certain of these credit agreements we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to nonus lenders to withholding taxes in conjunction with certain transactions such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of certain assets or businesses we sometimes provide routine indemnifications the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we have no accrual related to indemnifications on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2014 and 2013 subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations  the ability of some of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends contingencies  we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available we have recorded accruals in our consolidated financial statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated although the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate however our evaluation of the likely impact of these matters may change in the future we accrue for

to officers and other employees in conjunction with our acquisition of talx we assumed options outstanding under the legacy talx stock option plan which was approved by talx shareholders in addition stock options remain outstanding under three shareholderapproved plans and three nonshareholderapproved plans from which no new grants may be made the 2008 omnibus incentive plan requires that stock options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant generally stock options are subject to graded vesting for periods of up to three years based on service with 33 vesting for each year of completed service and expire ten years from the grant date we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january 1 2006 the binomial model incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior expected stock price volatility dividend yield and riskfree interest rate anticipated employee exercise behavior and expected postvesting cancellations over the contractual term used in the binomial model were primarily based on historical exercise patterns these historical exercise patterns indicated there was not significantly different exercise behavior between employee groups for our expected stock price volatility assumption we weighted historical volatility and implied volatility we used daily observations for historical volatility while our implied volatility assumption was based on actively traded options related to our common stock the expected term is derived from the binomial model based on assumptions incorporated into the binomial model as described above the fair value for stock options granted during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was estimated

to dilute the interests of any person or group attempting to take control of the company if the attempt is not deemed by our board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders under the rights agreement as originally adopted in october 1995 and amended and restated in october 2005 holders of our common stock were granted one right to purchase common stock or right for each outstanding share of common stock held of record on november 24 1995 all newly issued shares of common stock since that date have been accompanied by a right the rights would have become exercisable and traded independently from our common stock if a person or group acquired or obtained the right to acquire 20 or more of equifaxs outstanding shares of common stock or commenced a tender or exchange offer that would have resulted in that person or group acquiring 20 or more of the outstanding common stock in each case without the consent of our board in the event the rights had become exercisable each holder other than the acquiring person or group would have been entitled to purchase that number of shares of securities or other property of equifax having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right if equifax were acquired in a merger or other business combination each right would have entitled its holder to purchase the number of the acquiring companys common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right in either case our board could choose to redeem the rights for 001 per right before they became exercisable the rights had an expiration date of november 6 2015 unless earlier redeemed exchanged or amended by the board the board terminated the rights plan effective february 19 201584notes to consolidated financial

grandfathered participants and provided a onetime 9 increase to the accrued benefit as determined on december 31 2014 this amendment did not have a material impact on our pension expense for 2014on october 1 2012 we offered certain former us employees the option to receive their usrip pension benefits in either a lump sum payable by december 31 2012 or a reduced monthly annuity that will

available as of the measurement date discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan expected return on plan assets  the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2014 our us pension plan investment returns of 80 exceeded the expected return of 75 for the fifth time in five years the expected return for the usrip for 2015 remains at 75 which is consistent with the rate used in 2014 the crip earned 98 in 2014 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the fifth time in five years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for the usrip and crip utilizes a marketrelated value of assets the

asset allocation strategies  the primary goal of the asset allocation strategy of the plan is to produce a total investment return which will satisfy future annual cash benefit payments to participants and minimize future contributions from the company additionally this strategy will diversify the plan assets to minimize nonsystemic risk and provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of security will have a disproportionate impact on the plan investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of erisa standards of performance for each manager include an expected return versus an assigned benchmark a measure of volatility and a time period of evaluation the asset allocation strategy is determined by our external advisor forecasting investment returns by asset class and providing allocation guidelines to maximize returns while minimizing the volatility and correlation of those returns investment recommendations are made by our external advisor working in conjunction with our inhouse investment officer the asset allocation and ranges are approved by inhouse investment fiduciaries and plan administrators who are named fiduciaries under erisa the plan in an effort to meet asset allocation objectives utilizes a variety of asset classes which has historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the sampp 500 in most environments asset classes included in this category of alternative assets include hedge funds private equity including secondary private equity and real assets real estate funds of hard asset securities and private equity funds focused on real assets the primary benefits of using these types of asset classes are 1 their noncorrelated returns reduce the overall volatility of the plans portfolio of assets and 2 their ability to produce superior riskadjusted returns this has allowed the plans average annual investment return to exceed the sampp 500 index return over the last ten years additionally the plan allows certain of their managers subject to specific risk constraints to utilize derivative instruments in order to enhance asset return reduce volatility or both derivatives are primarily employed by the plans in their fixed income portfolios and in the hedge fundoffunds area derivatives can be used for hedging purposes to reduce risk the plan is prohibited from investing additional amounts in equifax stock once the market value of stock held by each plan exceeds 10 of the total market value of each plan in 2011 all shares of equifax common stock
