financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on us    at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb will impact the us economy and our products and services   compliance with these new laws and regulations may require changes in the way we conduct our business and will result in additional compliance costs which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity    12       international data and privacy protection   we are subject to data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the various foreign countries where we do business including without limitation the following        in canada the federal and provincial privacy and provincial credit reporting laws apply to organizations with respect to personal information that they collect use or disclose in the course of commercial activities the laws are based on the national standard of canada model code for the protection of personal information covering accountability and identifying purposes consent collection use disclosure retention accuracy safeguards individual access and compliance the federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention and provisions of canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned the european union or eu recognizes canada as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing         in europe equifax is subject to the eu data protection regulations including the comprehensive eu directive on data protection 1995 the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security the eu standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries where equifax operates in the uk in addition to the eu directive on data protection the data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data in addition regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations in spain and portugal the privacy laws which are subject to the eu directive on data protection regulate all credit bureau and personal solutions activities the eu is currently reviewing its data protection regime seeking to modernize the legal framework strengthen individual rights reduce administrative formalities and improve the clarity and coherence of laws within the eu          in latin america consumer reporting data protection and privacy laws and regulations exist in various forms in argentina chile costa rica ecuador el salvador peru and uruguay argentina and uruguay generally follow the eu data protection model and the eu recognizes argentinas laws as providing adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing among other protections laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal data   constitutional laws in argentina chile ecuador peru and uruguay also establish specific privacy rights and judicial proceedings may be used to enforce them the chilean legislature is considering a comprehensive data protection bill and a separate bill that would create a publiclymanaged consumer credit registry ecuadors national assembly recently approved a law to replace private sector credit bureaus with a staterun registry the government has not issued regulations yet to implement the changes and has indicated that private sector companies will be permitted to provide unspecified credit reference services ecuadors wtogatt commitments include no market access or national treatment limits for credit reference services the law provides a transition period throughout 2013 for the development and introduction of the new registry legislation has also been proposed in argentina and uruguay that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be used and create new access and notification rights for data subjects the argentinian legislation has not proceeded beyond the introductory debate stage and the uruguayan government does not support the legislation proposed in that country costa rica is finalizing regulations that will be issued under its data protection legislation while the potential impact of regulatory changes in peru ecuador uruguay or costa rica are unlikely to be material to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be material         in india various legislation including the information technology act 2000 and the credit information companies regulation act 2005 establishes a federal data protection framework entities that collect and maintain personal credit information must ensure that it is complete accurate and safeguarded and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting processing preserving sharing and using such credit information     13      tax management services   the tax management services business within our workforce solutions segment is potentially impacted by changes in us tax laws or interpretations for example those pertaining to work opportunity tax credits and unemployment compensation claims   environmental regulation   we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety health and environmental protection compliance with these laws and regulations has not in the past had any material effect on our earnings capital expenditures or competitive position however the effect of such compliance in the future cannot be predicted we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal state and local safety health and environmental regulations   personnel   equifax employed approximately 7000 employees

presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business financial results or results of operations may be adversely impacted these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k    15      weakness in consumer lending activity could materially adversely affect us   business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available   the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services   we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share   our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins   we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins   we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell tribureau and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability   some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins    16      if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer   we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process   the impact of consolidation in the financial services mortgage retail telecommunications and other markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business   the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us   security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer   in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy   despite our substantial investment in security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events   we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention    17      dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively   as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty   changes in interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income   rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect our returns as well   our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows   we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows   concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies with the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financing   as a result of the debt crisis concerns have been raised regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro be dissolved entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations particularly in portugal spain and ireland and the future profitability or even viability of our operations in those countries in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on global economies and capital markets generally and more specifically on the companys business in europe and the ability of the company and its customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and on the demand for our products and services   the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results   during 2012 we completed the acquisition of various businesses in separate transactions including certain business assets and the operations of computer sciences corporation csc credit services and several smaller international acquisitions expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition    18       our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties   our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to privacy and consumer data protection health and safety tax labor and environmental regulations see item 1 business  information security and government regulation in this form 10k these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products    these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business   as in the united states legislation regarding the availability or use of consumer and commercial data has been and continues to be proposed from time to time in various foreign countries in which we have operations most notably in certain latin american and european union countries these proposals have in some cases had the potential to expand the availability or uses of information and in other cases had the potential to restrict the availability or use of information we currently maintain accordingly such possible regulatory action could either increase or decrease our potential revenue and profits   we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer   third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services   from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all    19      third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights   our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage   we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue   economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations   sales outside the us comprise 24 of our net operating revenue and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions trade protection measures data privacy and consumer protection regulations difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner implementation of exchange controls and geopolitical instability including terrorism and war   we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results   additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries and could adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will not violate our policies      20      our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel   our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees   unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us   we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including putative class action claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results   changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income   federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws   we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business   in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business   item 1b unresolved staff comments   not applicable   item 2 properties   our executive offices are located at 1550 peachtree street nw atlanta georgia our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide we consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet our current operating requirements and most of the space is being utilized we ordinarily lease office space for conducting our business and are obligated under approximately 80 leases and other rental arrangements for our field locations we owned six office buildings at december 31 2012 including our executive offices two buildings which house our atlanta georgia data center two buildings utilized by our workforce solutions operations located in st louis missouri and charleston south carolina as well as a building utilized by our latin america operations located in sao paulo brazil we also own 235 acres adjacent to the atlanta georgia data center   for additional information regarding our obligations under leases see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report we believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate our future needs      21      item 3 legal proceedings   equifax certain of its subsidiaries and other persons have been named as parties in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in connection with the operation of equifaxs businesses in most cases plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief these actions include the following   california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al  plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims the district court subsequently deferred final approval of the settlement and required the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs counsel fee award mailing of the supplemental notice was completed on february 15 2011 the deadline for this group of settling plaintiffs to provide additional documentation to support their damage claims or to optout of the settlement was march 31 2011 on july 15 2011 following another approval hearing the district court approved the settlement several objecting plaintiffs subsequently filed notices of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the parties have filed their briefs and the case is currently pending with oral arguments scheduled for march 2013   other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process    item 4 mine safety disclosures   not applicable      22      part ii   item 5 market for the registrants common

for 851 million during 2012    business environment and company outlook   we expect us mortgage refinancing activity to remain strong through the first half of 2013 but then trend down in the second half of 2013 we also expect a continuation of modest economic growth in most of our served markets the environment will continue to be challenging as various countries deal with their particular political fiscal and economic issues however we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure strategic acquisitions and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver long term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2013 we expect total revenue growth from continuing operations of 10 to 12 as the impact of our acquisition of the csc credit services business will more than outweigh the negative impact of the expected

1827    12  593    4    cost of services cost of services from continuing operations increased 703 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 797 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million   the slight increase in cost of services from continuing operations in 2011 when compared to 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and benefits expense and contract services expenses of 311 million and by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 72 million largely offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business   selling general and administrative expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 702 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expense by 27 million   selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations increased 571 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased salary and incentive expense of 333 million higher advertising expenses of 91 million and higher severance costs offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling general and administrative expense by 52 million in 2011   depreciation and amortization the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce solutions   depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to 66 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam and our 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of talx in 2007 which fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation

387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth   operating income from continuing operations for 2011 increased faster than revenue due to operating leverage from revenue growth and business mix as well as the deconsolidation of brazil which reduced reported revenue but which had little impact on operating profit because it had been operating near breakeven these factors resulted in operating

merger of our business in brazil into bvs the increase was also driven by 40 million of pension contributions in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a 301 million reduction in cash related to deferred income taxes and a 249 million use of cash related to increased prepaid assets and other current assets   cash provided by operating activities for 2011 increased by 561 million over the prior year cash provided from net income adjusted for the impact of divestitures increased by 203 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was primarily driven by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably from a 100 million decrease in pension contributions in 2011 and other lesser changes in liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth    38      fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in

program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility   we had a 364day revolving credit agreement with a canadian bank our canadian credit facility which permitted us to borrow up to c100 million denominated in canadian dollars the canadian credit facility was scheduled to terminate in june 2011 we cancelled this agreement at the end of the first quarter 2011 and there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at the time of cancellation   at december 31 2012 there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and 2650 million outstanding under our cp program at december 31

primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of 2650 million of cp notes as of december 31 2012 that was used to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services the change in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2011 primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of cp notes at december 31 2011 as compared to a net repayment of 1340 million of cp notes during 2010 as we decreased our use of cp to fund our capital needs   on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012   debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limit the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 208 at december 31 2012 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants   we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes discussed above contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest   credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency   longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2012 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2011 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment    42      for additional information about our debt including the terms of our financing arrangements basis for variable

primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2012 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance        5 for future interest payments on variablerate debt which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2012 to calculate these payments our variable rate debt at december 31 2012 consisted of cp borrowings under our credit facilities and our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2012 through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2012 ranged from 04 to 21 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates        6 this table excludes 242 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities     44      offbalance sheet transactions   we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities   pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 884 million and 653 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company   letters of credit and guarantees   we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2012 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2012   benefit plans   we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 25 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan in 2011   at december 31 2012 the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip during the year ended december 31 2011 we made contributions of 400 million to the usrip we also contributed 37 million and 26 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities   for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap   for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report   seasonality   we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest    45      effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates   equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability   a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency   recent accounting pronouncements   for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report   application of critical accounting policies and estimates   the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes   if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met    46      the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract   we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract   many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract   we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance   we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction   deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies   judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services   in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported    47      effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue   goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets   we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating

goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we performed the qualitative assessment for our consumer information solutions latin america europe canada consumer north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units   judgments and uncertainties  in determining the fair value of our reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value      48      under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our competition discussion in item 1 of our 2012 annual report on form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information id management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation verification services tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies notably adp and paychex inc as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple   the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value   we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test   growth assumptions   the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our managements discussion and analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3 to 5 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve   we projected revenue growth in 2013 for our reporting units in completing our 2012 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units such as demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration in verification services and talent management services reporting units and not based on the assumption of meaningful economic recovery growth in the talent management services reporting unit is also based on growth in the commercial sector of that business the anticipated revenue growth in all of the reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2012 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units    49      discount rate assumptions   we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the companys tax rate for the 2012 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from 9 to 12 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit   estimated fair value and sensitivities   the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2012 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september 30 2012 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded   the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the companys reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2012 ranged from approximately 17 to 125   the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of 261 million as of september 30 2012 this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september 30 2012 if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecasted projected revenue growth for commercial customers does not materialize or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and would likely result in the recognition of an impairment loss additionally an increase in the discount rate due to outside factors or a decrease in the market multiples would likely result in an impairment   no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2012 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2012   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material    50      loss contingencies   we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote   judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material   income taxes   we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable   our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals   judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities   we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2012 242 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 114 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material   pension and other postretirement plans   we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost   judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material    51      we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan   the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2012 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 775 for the third time in the last four years however due to lower forecasted future returns the expected return for 2013 was reduced to 75 the crip earned 88 in 2012 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the third time in four years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for 2013 is 743 as compared to 767 which was the 2012 expected rate   annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5459 million at december 31 2012 we do not expect our 2013 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2012 cost excluding the pension settlement and curtailment recorded in 2012 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 767 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 417 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 13 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material   purchase accounting for acquisitions   we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income   judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations   on december 28 2012 we acquired csc credit services recorded total assets of 10 billion as of the acquisition date the assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to this acquisition   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets    52      item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes   foreign currency exchange rate risk   a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business   we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency   for the year ended december 31 2012 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2012 would have increased our revenue by 494 million and our pretax operating profit by 167 million for the year ended december 31 2011 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2011 would have increased our revenue by 502 million and our pretax operating profit by 152 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2012 and 2011   interest rate risk   our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2012 our weighted average cost of debt was 40 and weightedaverage life of debt was 86 years at december 31 2012 68 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 32 was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2012 interest expense by 54 million   based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have material exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors    53

variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary other parties interests in consolidated entities are reported as noncontrolling interests we use the equity method of accounting for investments in which we are able to exercise significant influence and use the cost method for all other investments all significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated   our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented therein certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not material   segments we manage our business and report our financial results through the following five reportable segments which are the same as operating segments      us consumer information solutions or uscis       international       workforce solutions       north america personal solutions       north america commercial solutions     63      notes to consolidated financial statements   uscis is our largest reportable segment with 42 of total operating revenue for 2012 our most significant foreign operations are located in canada and the uk   use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with gaap accordingly we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our consolidated financial statements are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made including the consideration of events that have occurred up until the point these consolidated financial statements have been filed these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from these estimates   revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relates to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes   if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met   the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a portion of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract   we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract    64      notes to consolidated financial statements   many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract   we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance   we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction   deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies   cost of services cost of services consist primarily of 1 data acquisition and royalty fees 2 customer service costs which include personnel costs to collect maintain and update our proprietary databases to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support 3 hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems 4 telecommunication and computer network expense and 5 occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by equifax employees   selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs restructuring costs corporate costs fees for professional and consulting services advertising costs and other costs of administration   advertising advertising costs from continuing operations which are expensed as incurred totaled 487 million 420 million and 326 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   stockbased compensation we recognize the cost of stockbased payment transactions in the financial statements over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stockbased awards issued all of our stockbased awards which are stock options and nonvested stock are classified as equity instruments   income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized   we record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates or when statutory terms expire changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur    65      notes to consolidated financial statements   earnings per share our basic earnings per share or eps is calculated as net income divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding the net income amounts used in both our basic and diluted eps calculations are the same a reconciliation of the weightedaverage outstanding shares used in the two calculations is as follows        twelve months ended december 31      2012   2011   2010      in millions   weightedaverage shares outstanding basic   1199    1219    1248   effect of dilutive securities                 stock options and restricted stock units   26    18    17   weightedaverage shares outstanding diluted   1225    1237    1265     for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 01 million 23 million and 33 million stock options respectively were antidilutive and therefore excluded from this calculation   cash equivalents we consider all highlyliquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we do not recognize interest income on our trade accounts receivable additionally we generally do not require collateral from our customers related to our trade accounts receivable   the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical writeoff experience an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition we reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense which are included in selling general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income bad debt expense from continuing operations was 21 million 28 million and 08 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   longlived assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the cost of additions is capitalized property and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally three to ten years for data processing equipment and capitalized internaluse software and systems costs leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms that are reasonably assured buildings are depreciated over a fortyyear period other fixed assets are depreciated over three to seven years upon sale or retirement of an asset the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized and included in income from operations on the consolidated statements of income with the classification of any gain or loss dependent on the characteristics of the asset sold or retired   certain internaluse software and system development costs are capitalized accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the

certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 884 million and 653 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company   impairment of longlived assets we monitor the status of our longlived assets in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset group is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset groups ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize estimates of discounted future cash flows to determine the asset groups fair value we did not record any impairment losses in any of the periods presented   goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 each year   in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required for reporting units that we determine meet these criteria we perform a qualitative assessment in this qualitative assessment we consider the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that significantly exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not if it is determined it is not more likely than not no further testing is required if further testing is required we continue with the quantitative impairment test   in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then no further testing is required however if a reporting units fair value were to be less than its carrying value we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded its implied value    67

assets are not amortized we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value our annual impairment test date is september 30 we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value   we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and we determined that there was no impairment in any of these years   purchased intangible assets purchased intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer credit files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada we expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period

plans we sponsor various pension and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired us employees benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and for some pension plans benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and other postretirement plans   foreign currency translation the functional currency of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries is that subsidiarys local currency we translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the yearend rate of exchange and revenue and expenses at the monthly average rates during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment in other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature in accumulated other comprehensive loss   financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable accounts payable and short and longterm debt the carrying amounts of these items other than longterm debt approximate their fair market values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of our fixedrate debt is determined using level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for publicly traded instruments and for nonpublicly traded instruments through valuation techniques depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument taking into account credit risk as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of our fixedrate debt was 16 billion and 109 billion respectively compared to its carrying value of 15 billion and 097 billion respectively based on recent trading prices    68      notes to consolidated financial statements   derivatives and hedging activities although derivative financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes or as the companys primary risk management tool derivatives have been used as a risk management tool to hedge the companys exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have used interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed and floatingrate borrowings forward contracts on various foreign currencies have been used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk of certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivative valuations reflect the value of the instrument including the value associated with any material counterparty risk   fair value hedges in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate and are recorded in interest expense the full fair value of the interest rate swap is classified as a noncurrent asset or liability as the remaining maturity of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge is more than twelve months there was no ineffectiveness on our fair value hedge that impacted current year earnings the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 122 million and 148 million respectively recorded in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets   cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of income in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings we did not have any unsettled cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2012 or december 31 2011   fair value measurements fair value is determined based on the assumptions marketplace participants use in pricing the asset or liability we use a three level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data eg a companys own data the adoption of fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate any of these vies   recent accounting pronouncements testing goodwill for impairment  in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual

qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we implemented the new standard in our 2012 annual goodwill impairment testing and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   comprehensive income in the first quarter of 2012 we adopted accounting standards update no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income which changed our financial statement presentation but did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations   testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in july 2012 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test under that option a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the company determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted we will implement the new standard in our 2013 annual impairment testing this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   other comprehensive income in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of

fair value of the investment recorded in accounting for the transaction we wrote off 332 million of goodwill and 270 million of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in addition as part of the agreement with bvs we have retained certain contingent liabilities a pretax loss of 103 million was recognized during the second quarter of 2011 related to the brazilian transaction and is

borrowing limits of our existing unsecured revolving credit facility which we refer to as the senior credit facility by entering into a third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of december 19 2012 the amended agreement the senior credit facility had been scheduled to expire on february 18 2015 and provided 5000 million of borrowing capacity the amended agreement provides for a maturity date of december 19 2017 we elected to increase the size of the facility to 7500 million in line with our liquidity needs and current credit market conditions the amended agreement also provides an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to 10 billion borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our cp notes    75      notes to consolidated financial statements   under our senior credit facility

facilities   cp program during the fourth quarter of 2012 we increased the size of our cp program from 5000 million to 7500 million our cp program has been established through the private placement of cp notes from time to time in which borrowings bear interest at either a variable rate based on libor or other benchmarks or a fixed rate with the applicable rate and margin maturities of cp can range from overnight to 397 days because the cp program is backstopped by our senior credit facility the amount of cp which may be issued under the program is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any

notes to repay outstanding borrowings under our cp program a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness in conjunction with the senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the fixed interest rate

processing outsourcing services and other agreements we have separate agreements with ibm tcs and others to outsource portions of our computer data processing operations applications development maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services the agreements expire between 2013 and 2018 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately 70 million as of december 31 2012 with no future years minimum contractual obligation expected to exceed approximately 40 million annual payment obligations in regard to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings acquisitions or divestitures the introduction of significant new technologies foreign currency or the general rate of inflation in certain circumstances eg a change in control or for our convenience we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay a significant penalty   during 2012 we amended certain portions and terminated certain other portions of our operations support services agreement for north america with ibm the amended agreement extends certain terms two years through december 2016 and changes certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company during 2011 we amended our operations support services agreement in north america with ibm the amended agreement extended the term one year through december 2014 and changed certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company during 2010 we amended our data processing outsourcing agreement with ibm in the uk the amended agreement extended the term three years through december 2016 and allows for a reduction in the scope of services provided by ibm as well as financial savings to the company under our agreement with ibm which covers our operations in north america europe peru and chile we have outsourced certain of our mainframe and midrange operations help desk service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks the scope of such services varies by location the estimated future minimum contractual obligation under the revised agreement is approximately 60 million for the remaining term with no individual years minimum expected to exceed approximately 30 million we may terminate certain portions of this agreement without penalty in the event that ibm is in material breach of the terms of the agreement during 2012 2011 and 2010 we paid 705 million 797 million and 611 million respectively for these services   change in control agreements we have entered into change in control severance agreements with certain key executives the agreements provide for among other things certain payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment ie termination of employment by the executive for good reason or termination of employment by the company without cause each as defined in the agreements following a change in control of the company in the event of a qualifying termination the executive will become entitled to continuation of group health dental vision life disability 401k and similar benefits for three years as well as a lump sum severance payment all of which differs by executive   the change in control agreements have a threeyear term and automatically renew for another three years unless we elect not to renew the agreements change in control events potentially triggering benefits under the agreements would occur subject to certain exceptions if 1 any person acquires 20 or more of our voting stock 2 upon a merger or other business combination our shareholders receive less than twothirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company 3 we sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or 4 we liquidate or dissolve   if these change in control agreements had been triggered as of december 31 2012 payments of approximately 481 million would have been made excluding tax grossup amounts of 266 million under the companys existing director and employee stock benefit plans a change in control generally would result in the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and satisfaction of the restrictions on any outstanding nonvested stock awards    78      notes to consolidated financial statements   guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is not material at december 31 2012 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2012   general indemnifications we are the lessee under many real estate leases it is common in these commercial lease transactions for us as the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises this type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of among others contractors licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises this indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct   certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations in certain of these credit agreements we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to nonus lenders to withholding taxes   in conjunction with certain transactions such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of certain assets or businesses we sometimes provide routine indemnifications the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited   the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations   we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we have no accrual related to indemnifications on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011   subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations the ability of some of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends   contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available we have recorded accruals in our consolidated financial statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated   we also accrue for unpaid legal fees for services performed to date although the final outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate however our evaluation of the likely impact of these matters may change in the future    79      notes to consolidated financial statements   tax matters in 2003 the canada revenue agency or cra issued notices of reassessment asserting that acrofax inc a whollyowned canadian

material   equifax and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal state and international income taxes we are generally no longer subject to federal state or international income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007 due to the potential for resolution of state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations it is reasonably possible that

qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted to officers and other employees in conjunction with our acquisition of talx we assumed options outstanding under the legacy talx stock option plan which was approved by talx shareholders in addition stock options remain outstanding under three shareholderapproved plans and three nonshareholderapproved plans from which no new grants may be made the 2008 omnibus incentive plan requires that stock options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant generally stock options are subject to graded vesting for periods of up to three years based on service with 33 vesting for each year of completed service and expire ten years from the grant date   we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january 1 2006 the binomial model incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior expected stock price volatility dividend yield and riskfree interest rate anticipated employee exercise behavior and expected postvesting cancellations over the contractual term used in the binomial model were primarily based on historical exercise patterns these historical exercise patterns indicated there was not significantly different exercise behavior between employee groups for our expected stock price volatility assumption we weighted historical volatility and implied volatility we used daily observations for historical volatility while our implied volatility assumption was based on actively traded options related to our common stock the expected term is derived from the binomial model based on assumptions incorporated into the binomial model as described above   the fair value for stock options granted during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was estimated at the date of grant using the binomial model with the following weightedaverage assumptions        twelve months ended december 31      2012

executive officers employees and directors nonvested stock awards are generally subject to cliff vesting over a period between one to three years based on service   the fair value of nonvested stock is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant however since our nonvested stock does not pay dividends during the vesting period the fair value on the date of grant is reduced by the present value of the expected dividends over the requisite service period discounted using the appropriate riskfree interest rate   in 2012 pursuant to our 2008 omnibus incentive plan certain executive officers were granted nonvested shares in which the number of shares is dependent upon the companys threeyear relative total shareholder return as compared to the threeyear cumulative average quarterly shareholder return of the companies in the sampp 500 subject to adjustment the number of shares which could potentially be issued ranges from zero to 200 of the target

plan operates to dilute the interests of any person or group attempting to take control of the company if the attempt is not deemed by our board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders under the rights agreement as originally adopted in october 1995 and amended and restated in october 2005 holders of our common stock were granted one right to purchase common stock or right for each outstanding share of common stock held of record on november 24 1995 all newly issued shares of common stock since that date have been accompanied by a right the rights will become exercisable and trade independently from our common stock if a person or group acquires or obtains the right to acquire 20 or more of equifaxs outstanding shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that would result in that person or group acquiring 20 or more of the outstanding common stock in each case without the consent of our board in the event the rights become exercisable each holder other than the acquiring person or group will be entitled to purchase that number of shares of securities or other property of equifax having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right if equifax were acquired in a merger or other business combination each right would entitle its holder to purchase the number of the acquiring companys common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right in either case our board may choose to redeem the rights for 001 per right before they become exercisable the rights will expire on november 6 2015 unless earlier redeemed exchanged or amended by the board   11 benefit plans   we have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare

monthly annuity that will commence december 1 2012 the voluntary lump sum payment option was based on the present value of the participants pension benefit and was payable at the participants election in cash or rollover into a qualified retirement plan or ira the offer was made to approximately 3500 vested participants in the pension plan who had terminated employment prior to january 1 2012 and had not yet started to receive monthly payment of their pension benefit participants were required to make an irrevocable election to receive the lump sum payment by november 26 2012 approximately 64

allocation strategy of the plan is to produce a total investment return which will satisfy future annual cash benefit payments to participants and minimize future contributions from the company additionally this strategy will diversify the plan assets to minimize nonsystemic risk and provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of security will have a disproportionate impact on the plan investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of erisa standards of performance for each manager include an expected return versus an assigned benchmark a measure of volatility and a time period of evaluation   the asset allocation strategy is determined by our external advisor forecasting investment returns by asset class and providing allocation guidelines to maximize returns while minimizing the volatility and correlation of those returns investment recommendations are made by our external advisor working in conjunction with our inhouse investment officer the asset allocation and ranges are approved by inhouse plan administrators who are named fiduciaries under erisa    93      notes to consolidated financial statements   the plan in an effort to meet asset allocation objectives utilizes a variety of asset classes which has historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the sampp 500 in most environments asset classes included in this category of alternative assets include hedge funds private equity including secondary private equity and real assets real estate funds of hard asset securities and private equity funds focused on real assets the primary benefits of using these types of asset classes are 1 their noncorrelated returns reduce the overall volatility of the plans portfolio of assets and 2 their ability to produce superior riskadjusted returns this has allowed the plans average annual investment return to exceed the sampp 500 index return over the last ten years additionally the plan allows certain of their managers subject to specific risk constraints to utilize derivative instruments in order to enhance asset return reduce volatility or both derivatives are primarily employed by the plans in their fixed income portfolios and in the hedge fundoffunds area derivatives can be used for hedging purposes to reduce risk   the plan is prohibited from investing additional amounts in
