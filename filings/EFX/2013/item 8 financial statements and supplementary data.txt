adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the periods presented therein certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not material   segments we manage our business and report our financial results through the following five reportable segments which are the same as operating segments      us consumer information solutions or uscis       international       workforce solutions       north america personal solutions       north america commercial solutions     63      notes to consolidated financial statements   uscis is our largest reportable segment with 42 of total operating revenue for 2012 our most significant foreign operations are located in canada and the uk   use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with gaap accordingly we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our consolidated financial statements are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time they are made including the consideration of events that have occurred up until the point these consolidated financial statements have been filed these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from these estimates   revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relates to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes   if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met   the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a portion of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract   we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract    64      notes to consolidated financial statements   many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract   we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance   we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction   deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies   cost of services cost of services consist primarily of 1 data acquisition and royalty fees 2 customer service costs which include personnel costs to collect maintain and update our proprietary databases to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support 3 hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems 4 telecommunication and computer network expense and 5 occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed by equifax employees   selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs restructuring costs corporate costs fees for professional and consulting services advertising costs and other costs of administration   advertising advertising costs from continuing operations which are expensed as incurred totaled 487 million 420 million and 326 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   stockbased compensation we recognize the cost of stockbased payment transactions in the financial statements over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stockbased awards issued all of our stockbased awards which are stock options and nonvested stock are classified as equity instruments   income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by current enacted tax rates we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance as necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized   we record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates or when statutory terms expire changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur    65      notes to consolidated financial statements   earnings per share our basic earnings per share or eps is calculated as net income divided by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding the net income amounts used in both our basic and diluted eps calculations are the same a reconciliation of the weightedaverage outstanding shares used in the two calculations is as follows        twelve months ended december 31      2012   2011   2010      in millions   weightedaverage shares outstanding basic   1199    1219    1248   effect of dilutive securities                 stock options and restricted stock units   26    18    17   weightedaverage shares outstanding diluted   1225    1237    1265     for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 01 million 23 million and 33 million stock options respectively were antidilutive and therefore excluded from this calculation   cash equivalents we consider all highlyliquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we do not recognize interest income on our trade accounts receivable additionally we generally do not require collateral from our customers related to our trade accounts receivable   the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical writeoff experience an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition we reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense which are included in selling general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income bad debt expense from continuing operations was 21 million 28 million and 08 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   longlived assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the cost of additions is capitalized property and equipment are depreciated on a straightline basis over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally three to ten years for data processing equipment and capitalized internaluse software and systems costs leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms that are reasonably assured buildings are depreciated over a fortyyear period other fixed assets are depreciated over three to seven years upon sale or retirement of an asset the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized and included in income from operations on the consolidated statements of income with the classification of any gain or loss dependent on the characteristics of the asset sold or retired   certain internaluse software and system development costs are capitalized accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the predefined user and operating performance requirements as established during the preliminary stage of an internaluse software development project costs incurred during a software development projects preliminary stage and postimplementation stage are expensed as incurred application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration development of interfaces coding testing and installation capitalized internaluse software and systems costs are subsequently amortized on a straightline basis over a three to tenyear period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use    66      notes to consolidated financial statements   depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property and equipment was 750 million 750 million and 722 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   industrial revenue bonds pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 884 million and 653 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company   impairment of longlived assets we monitor the status of our longlived assets in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset group is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset groups ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize estimates of discounted future cash flows to determine the asset groups fair value we did not record any impairment losses in any of the periods presented   goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 each year   in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required for reporting units that we determine meet these criteria we perform a qualitative assessment in this qualitative assessment we consider the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination results in an amount that significantly exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determine whether the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not if it is determined it is not more likely than not no further testing is required if further testing is required we continue with the quantitative impairment test   in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment in the quantitative impairment test we use a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units fair value under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then no further testing is required however if a reporting units fair value were to be less than its carrying value we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded its implied value    67      notes to consolidated financial statements   contractualterritorial rights represent the estimated fair value of rights to operate in certain territories acquired through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada our contractualterritorial rights are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value our annual impairment test date is september 30 we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized if the assets estimated fair value is less than its carrying value   we completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and we determined that there was no impairment in any of these years   purchased intangible assets purchased intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our business purchased data files represent the estimated fair value of consumer credit files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada we expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred we amortize purchased data files which primarily consist of acquired credit files on a straightline basis predominantly all of our other purchased intangible assets are also amortized on a straightline basis     asset   useful life       in years   purchased data files   2 to 15   acquired software and technology   1 to 10   noncompete agreements   1 to 10   proprietary database   6 to 10   customer relationships   2 to 25   trade names   5 to 15     other assets other assets on our consolidated balance sheets primarily represents our investment in unconsolidated affiliates interest rate swaps assets related to life insurance policies covering certain officers of the company employee benefit trust assets and data purchases net of related amortization   benefit plans we sponsor various pension and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired us employees benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and for some pension plans benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets our consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the pension and other postretirement plans   foreign currency translation the functional currency of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries is that subsidiarys local currency we translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the yearend rate of exchange and revenue and expenses at the monthly average rates during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment in other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity we also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature in accumulated other comprehensive loss   financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable accounts payable and short and longterm debt the carrying amounts of these items other than longterm debt approximate their fair market values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of our fixedrate debt is determined using level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for publicly traded instruments and for nonpublicly traded instruments through valuation techniques depending on the specific characteristics of the debt instrument taking into account credit risk as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of our fixedrate debt was 16 billion and 109 billion respectively compared to its carrying value of 15 billion and 097 billion respectively based on recent trading prices    68      notes to consolidated financial statements   derivatives and hedging activities although derivative financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes or as the companys primary risk management tool derivatives have been used as a risk management tool to hedge the companys exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we have used interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed and floatingrate borrowings forward contracts on various foreign currencies have been used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk of certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivative valuations reflect the value of the instrument including the value associated with any material counterparty risk   fair value hedges in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debts fixed interest rate to a variable rate these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate and are recorded in interest expense the full fair value of the interest rate swap is classified as a noncurrent asset or liability as the remaining maturity of the fixedrate senior notes they hedge is more than twelve months there was no ineffectiveness on our fair value hedge that impacted current year earnings the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 122 million and 148 million respectively recorded in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets   cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of highly effective derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of income in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings we did not have any unsettled cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2012 or december 31 2011   fair value measurements fair value is determined based on the assumptions marketplace participants use in pricing the asset or liability we use a three level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data and unobservable data eg a companys own data the adoption of fair value guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   the following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis             fair value measurements at reporting date using   description  fair value at  december 31 2012   quoted prices

fair value of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges and notes are based on the present value of expected future cash flows using zero coupon rates and are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy     69      notes to consolidated financial statements     2 we maintain deferred compensation plans that allow for certain management employees to defer the receipt of compensation such as salary incentive compensation and commissions until a later date based on the terms of the plans the liability representing benefits accrued for plan participants is valued at the quoted market prices of the participants investment elections    variable interest entities we hold interests in certain entities including credit data and information solutions ventures that are considered variable interest entities or vies these variable interests relate to ownership interests that require financial support for these entities our investments related to these vies totaled 135 million at december 31 2012 representing our maximum exposure to loss these investments are classified in other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets we are not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate any of these vies   recent accounting pronouncements testing goodwill for impairment  in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we implemented the new standard in our 2012 annual goodwill impairment testing and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   comprehensive income in the first quarter of 2012 we adopted accounting standards update no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income which changed our financial statement presentation but did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations   testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in july 2012 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201202 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test under that option a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the company determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted we will implement the new standard in our 2013 annual impairment testing this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   other comprehensive income in february 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income which requires public companies to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their annual and interim financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   2 merger of brazilian business   on may 31 2011 we completed the merger of our brazilian business with boa vista serviços sa bvs in exchange for a 15 equity interest in bvs the brazilian transaction the transaction was accounted for as a sale of our brazilian business which was deconsolidated bvs an unrelated third party whose results we do not consolidate is the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil our investment in bvs was valued at 130 million brazilian reais 636 million and 694 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively is recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets and is accounted for using the cost method the initial fair value was determined by a thirdparty using income and market approaches we estimate the fair value of the investment at december 31 2012 in local currency approximates the initial fair value of the investment recorded in accounting for the transaction we wrote off 332 million of goodwill and 270 million of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in addition as part of the agreement with bvs we have retained certain contingent liabilities a pretax loss of 103 million was recognized during the second quarter of 2011 related to the brazilian transaction and is included in

in note 1 goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of september 30 each year as a result of the merger of our brazilian business in the second quarter of 2011 we performed an interim impairment test on the latin america reporting unit excluding our brazilian business which resulted in no impairment the fair value estimates for our reporting units were determined using a combination of the income and market approaches in accordance with the companys methodology our annual impairment tests as of september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 resulted in no

facility which we refer to as the senior credit facility by entering into a third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of december 19 2012 the amended agreement the senior credit facility had been scheduled to expire on february 18 2015 and provided 5000 million of borrowing capacity the amended agreement provides for a maturity date of december 19 2017 we elected to increase the size of the facility to 7500 million in line with our liquidity needs and current credit market conditions the amended agreement also provides an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to 10 billion borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our cp notes    75      notes to consolidated financial statements   under our senior credit facility we must comply with various financial and nonfinancial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated ebitda as set forth in the senior credit facility for the preceding four quarters of not more than 35 to 10 compliance with this financial covenant is tested quarterly the nonfinancial covenants include limitations on liens subsidiary debt mergers liquidations asset dispositions and acquisitions as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit facility our borrowings under this facility which have not been guaranteed by any

borrowings under the senior credit facility which is included in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets   while the underlying final maturity date of this facility is december 2017 it is

activities portion of our consolidated statements of cash flows as net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities   cp program during the fourth quarter of 2012 we increased the size of our cp program from 5000 million to 7500 million our cp program has been established through the private placement of cp notes from time to time in which borrowings bear interest at either a variable rate based on libor or other benchmarks or a fixed rate with the applicable rate and margin maturities of cp can range from overnight to 397 days because the cp program is backstopped by our senior credit facility the amount of cp which may be issued under the program is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at december 31 2012 2650 million in cp notes was outstanding all with maturities of less than 90 days

which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness in conjunction with the senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the fixed interest rate to a variable rate the longterm debt fair value adjustment related to

agreements with ibm tcs and others to outsource portions of our computer data processing operations applications development maintenance and related functions and to provide certain other administrative and operational services the agreements expire between 2013 and 2018 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately 70 million as of december 31 2012 with no future years minimum contractual obligation expected to exceed approximately 40 million annual payment obligations in regard to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings acquisitions or divestitures the introduction of significant new technologies foreign currency or the general rate of inflation in certain circumstances eg a change in control or for our convenience we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay a significant penalty   during 2012 we amended certain portions and terminated certain other portions of our operations support services agreement for north america with ibm the amended agreement extends certain terms two years through december 2016 and changes certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company during 2011 we amended our operations support services agreement in north america with ibm the amended agreement extended the term one year through december 2014 and changed certain variable cost to fixed cost intended to provide financial savings to the company during 2010 we amended our data processing outsourcing agreement with ibm in the uk the amended agreement extended the term three years through december 2016 and allows for a reduction in the scope of services provided by ibm as well as financial savings to the company under our agreement with ibm which covers our operations in north america europe peru and chile we have outsourced certain of our mainframe and midrange operations help desk service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks the scope of such services varies by location the estimated future minimum contractual obligation under the revised agreement is approximately 60 million for the remaining term with no individual years minimum expected to exceed approximately 30 million we may terminate certain portions of this agreement without penalty in the event that ibm is in material breach of the terms of the agreement during 2012 2011 and 2010 we paid 705 million 797 million and 611 million respectively for these services   change in control agreements we have entered into change in control severance agreements with certain key executives the agreements provide for among other things certain payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment ie termination of employment by the executive for good reason or termination of employment by the company without cause each as defined in the agreements following a change in control of the company in the event of a qualifying termination the executive will become entitled to continuation of group health dental vision life disability 401k and similar benefits for three years as well as a lump sum severance payment all of which differs by executive   the change in control agreements have a threeyear term and automatically renew for another three years unless we elect not to renew the agreements change in control events potentially triggering benefits under the agreements would occur subject to certain exceptions if 1 any person acquires 20 or more of our voting stock 2 upon a merger or other business combination our shareholders receive less than twothirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company 3 we sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or 4 we liquidate or dissolve   if these change in control agreements had been triggered as of december 31 2012 payments of approximately 481 million would have been made excluding tax grossup amounts of 266 million under the companys existing director and employee stock benefit plans a change in control generally would result in the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and satisfaction of the restrictions on any outstanding nonvested stock awards    78      notes to consolidated financial statements   guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is not material at december 31 2012 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2012   general indemnifications we are the lessee under many real estate leases it is common in these commercial lease transactions for us as the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises this type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of among others contractors licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises this indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct   certain of our credit agreements include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations in certain of these credit agreements we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to nonus lenders to withholding taxes   in conjunction with certain transactions such as sales or purchases of operating assets or services in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of certain assets or businesses we sometimes provide routine indemnifications the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited   the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with the related legal proceedings the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations   we cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered we have no accrual related to indemnifications on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011   subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations the ability of some of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends   contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we periodically assess our exposure related to these matters based on the information which is available we have recorded accruals in our consolidated financial statements for those matters in which it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated   we also accrue for unpaid legal fees for services performed to date although the final outcome of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate however our evaluation of the likely impact of these matters may change in the future    79      notes to consolidated financial statements   tax matters in 2003 the

benefits that if recognized would have affected the effective tax rate was 206 million and 189 million respectively which included interest and penalties of 41 million and 45 million respectively the accruals for potential interest and penalties during 2012 and 2011 were not material   equifax and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal state and international income taxes we are generally no longer subject to federal state or international income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007 due to the potential for resolution of state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations it is reasonably possible that equifaxs gross unrecognized tax benefit balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to 114 million   9 stockbased compensation   we have one active sharebased award plan the 2008 omnibus incentive plan which was approved by our shareholders in 2008 that provides our directors officers and certain employees with stock options and nonvested stock the plan is described below we expect to issue common shares held by treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options or once nonvested shares vest total stockbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was as follows    83      notes to consolidated financial

twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow this requirement reduced operating cash flows and increased financing cash flows by 17 million 12 million and 35 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   stock options the 2008 omnibus incentive plan provides that qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted to officers and other employees in conjunction with our acquisition of talx we assumed options outstanding under the legacy talx stock option plan which was approved by talx shareholders in addition stock options remain outstanding under three shareholderapproved plans and three nonshareholderapproved plans from which no new grants may be made the 2008 omnibus incentive plan requires that stock options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant generally stock options are subject to graded vesting for periods of up to three years based on service with 33 vesting for each year of completed service and expire ten years from the grant date   we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january 1 2006 the binomial model incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior expected stock price volatility dividend yield and riskfree interest rate anticipated employee exercise behavior and expected postvesting cancellations over the contractual term used in the binomial model were primarily based on historical exercise patterns these historical exercise patterns indicated there was not significantly different exercise behavior between employee groups for our expected stock price volatility assumption we weighted historical volatility and implied volatility we used daily observations for historical volatility while our implied volatility assumption was based on actively traded options related to our common stock the expected term is derived from the binomial model based on assumptions incorporated into the binomial model as described above   the fair value for stock options granted during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was estimated at the date of grant using the binomial model with the following weightedaverage assumptions        twelve months ended december 31      2012   2011   2010                  dividend yield   18   18   05  expected volatility   319   327   299  riskfree interest rate

the number of inthemoney stock options as of the same date this represents the value that would have been received by the stock option holders if they had all exercised their stock options on december 31 2012 in future periods this amount will change depending on fluctuations in equifaxs stock price the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 383 million 99 million and 147 million respectively at december 31 2012 our total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was 55 million with a weightedaverage

shares of our common stock that can be granted to executive officers employees and directors nonvested stock awards are generally subject to cliff vesting over a period between one to three years based on service   the fair value of nonvested stock is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant however since our nonvested stock does not pay dividends during the vesting period the fair value on the date of grant is reduced by the present value of the expected dividends over the requisite service period discounted using the appropriate riskfree interest rate   in 2012 pursuant to our 2008 omnibus incentive plan certain executive officers were granted nonvested shares in which the number of shares is dependent upon the companys threeyear relative total shareholder return as compared to the threeyear cumulative average quarterly shareholder return of the companies in the sampp 500 subject to adjustment the number of shares which could potentially be issued ranges from zero to 200 of the target award the grants outstanding subject to market performance as of december 31 2012 would result in 181803 shares outstanding at 100 of target and 363606 at

consolidated financial statements    10 shareholder rights plan   our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect our shareholders against abusive takeover attempts and tactics the rights plan operates to dilute the interests of any person or group attempting to take control of the company if the attempt is not deemed by our board of directors to be in the best interests of our shareholders under the rights agreement as originally adopted in october 1995 and amended and restated in october 2005 holders of our common stock were granted one right to purchase common stock or right for each outstanding share of common stock held of record on november 24 1995 all newly issued shares of common stock since that date have been accompanied by a right the rights will become exercisable and trade independently from our common stock if a person or group acquires or obtains the right to acquire 20 or more of equifaxs outstanding shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that would result in that person or group acquiring 20 or more of the outstanding common stock in each case without the consent of our board in the event the rights become exercisable each holder other than the acquiring person or group will be entitled to purchase that number of shares of securities or other property of equifax having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the right if equifax were acquired in a merger or other business combination each right would entitle its holder to purchase the number of the acquiring companys common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right in either case our board may choose to redeem the rights for 001 per right before they become exercisable the rights will expire on november 6 2015 unless earlier redeemed exchanged or amended by the board   11 benefit plans   we have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans we also maintain certain healthcare and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired employees the measurement date for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is december 31 of each year   pension benefits pension benefits are provided through us and canadian defined benefit pension plans and two supplemental executive defined benefit pension plans   us and canadian retirement plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 25 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip also frozen to new hires on october 1 2011   on october 1 2012 we offered certain former employees the option to receive their usrip pension benefits in either a lump sum payable by december 31 2012 or a reduced monthly annuity that will commence december 1 2012 the voluntary lump sum payment option was based on the present value of the participants pension benefit and was payable at the participants election in cash or rollover into a qualified retirement plan or ira the offer was made to approximately 3500 vested participants in the pension plan who had terminated employment prior to january 1 2012 and had not yet started to receive monthly payment of their pension benefit participants were required to make an irrevocable election to receive the lump sum payment by november 26 2012 approximately 64 of the vested terminated participants elected to receive the lump sum payment which resulted in a payment of 626 million the payment was made on december 21 2012 from existing plan assets approximately 90 vested terminated participants elected the accelerated reduced monthly annuity which is being paid from the pension plan    on november 7 2012 an amendment to the usrip was approved which froze future salary increases for nongrandfathered participants and provided a onetime 9 increase to the accrued benefit for these nongrandfathered participants who were employed on december 31 2012 this amendment along with the settlement described above resulted in a 387 million pension charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012     on september 14 2011 the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a redesign of our retirement plans for our currently active canadian employees effective january 1 2013 and for our new

payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve updated monthly to develop

investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2012 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 775 for the third time in the last four years however due to lower forecasted future returns the expected return for 2013 was reduced to 75 the crip earned 88 in 2012 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the third time in four years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities   the calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for the usrip and crip utilizes a

allocation strategies the primary goal of the asset allocation strategy of the plan is to produce a total investment return which will satisfy future annual cash benefit payments to participants and minimize future contributions from the company additionally this strategy will diversify the plan assets to minimize nonsystemic risk and provide reasonable assurance that no single security or class of security will have a disproportionate impact on the plan investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of erisa standards of performance for each manager include an expected return versus an assigned benchmark a measure of volatility and a time period of evaluation   the asset allocation strategy is determined by our external advisor forecasting investment returns by asset class and providing allocation guidelines to maximize returns while minimizing the volatility and correlation of those returns investment recommendations are made by our external advisor working in conjunction with our inhouse investment officer the asset allocation and ranges are approved by inhouse plan administrators who are named fiduciaries under erisa    93      notes to consolidated financial statements   the plan in an effort to meet asset allocation objectives utilizes a variety of asset classes which has historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the sampp 500 in most environments asset classes included in this category of alternative assets include hedge funds private equity including secondary private equity and real assets real estate funds of hard asset securities and private equity funds focused on real assets the primary benefits of using these types of asset classes are 1 their noncorrelated returns reduce the overall volatility of the plans portfolio of assets and 2 their ability to produce superior riskadjusted returns this has allowed the plans average annual investment return to exceed the sampp 500 index return over the last ten years additionally the plan allows certain of their managers subject to specific risk constraints to utilize derivative instruments in order to enhance asset return reduce volatility or both derivatives are primarily employed by the plans in their fixed income portfolios and in the hedge fundoffunds area derivatives can be used for hedging purposes to reduce risk   the
