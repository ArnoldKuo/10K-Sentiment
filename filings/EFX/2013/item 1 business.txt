wall street reform and consumer protection act 2010 or doddfrank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the us the doddfrank act will allow consumers free access to their credit score if their score negatively affects them in a financial transaction or a hiring decision and also gives consumers access to credit score disclosures as part of an adverse action and riskbased pricing notice title x of the doddfrank act establishes the bureau of consumer financial protection or cfpb within the federal reserve board and will require the cfpb and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations significant portions of the doddfrank act related to the cfpb became effective on july 21 2011 the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and our customers         under the doddfrank act the cfpb is the principal supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to nondepository institutions or nonbanks including without limitation any covered person who is a larger participant in a market for other consumer financial products or services      11      with the appointment of a cfpb director by the president on january 4 2012 the cfpb has begun to exercise authority to define unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices and to require reports and conduct examinations of these entities for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such entities and detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services the exercise of this supervisory authority must be riskbased meaning that the cfpb will identify nonbanks for examination based on the risk they pose to consumers including consideration of the entitys asset size transaction volume risk to consumers existing oversight by state authorities and any other factors that the cfpb determines to be relevant in july 2012 the cfpb issued a rule designating certain consumer reporting agencies including us as within its nonbank supervision program for larger participants our first examination as a credit reporting firm which focused on our regulatory compliance management system was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012    as a larger participant we are subject to cfpb supervisory examination and enforcement authority such examination may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures when a nonbank is in violation of federal consumer financial laws including the cfpbs own rules the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on us    at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb will impact the us economy and our products and services   compliance with these new laws and regulations may require changes in the way we conduct our business and will result in additional compliance costs which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity    12       international data and privacy protection   we are subject to data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and
