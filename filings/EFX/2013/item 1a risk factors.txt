risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business financial results or results of operations may be adversely impacted these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k    15      weakness in consumer lending activity could materially adversely affect us   business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available   the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services   we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share   our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins   we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins   we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell tribureau and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability   some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins    16      if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer   we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process   the impact of consolidation in the financial services mortgage retail telecommunications and other markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business   the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us   security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer   in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy   despite our substantial investment in security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events   we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention    17      dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively   as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty   changes in interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income   rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect our returns as well   our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows   we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows   concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies with the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financing   as a result of the debt crisis concerns have been raised regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro be dissolved entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations particularly in portugal spain and ireland and the future profitability or even viability of our operations in those countries in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on global economies and capital markets generally and more specifically on the companys business in europe and the ability of the company and its customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and on the demand for our products and services   the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results   during 2012 we completed the acquisition of various businesses in separate transactions including certain business assets and the operations of computer sciences corporation csc credit services and several smaller international acquisitions expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition    18       our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties   our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to privacy and consumer data protection health and safety tax labor and environmental regulations see item 1 business  information security and government regulation in this form 10k these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products    these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business   as in the united states legislation regarding the availability or use of consumer and commercial data has been and continues to be proposed from time to time in various foreign countries in which we have operations most notably in certain latin american and european union countries these proposals have in some cases had the potential to expand the availability or uses of information and in other cases had the potential to restrict the availability or use of information we currently maintain accordingly such possible regulatory action could either increase or decrease our potential revenue and profits   we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer   third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services   from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all    19      third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights   our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage   we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue   economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations   sales outside the us comprise 24 of our net operating revenue and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions trade protection measures data privacy and consumer protection regulations difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner implementation of exchange controls and geopolitical instability including terrorism and war   we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results   additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries and could adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will not violate our policies      20      our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel   our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees   unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us   we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including putative class action claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results   changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income   federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws   we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business   in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business
