credit services for 10 billion we financed the acquisition with available cash the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes and commercial paper borrowings under our cp program the results of this acquisition are included in our uscis segment and are not material for 2012          we repurchased 19 million shares of our common stock on the open market for 851 million during 2012    business environment and company outlook   we expect us mortgage refinancing activity to remain strong through the first half of 2013 but then trend down in the second half of 2013 we also expect a continuation of modest economic growth in most of our served markets the environment will continue to be challenging as various countries deal with their particular political fiscal and economic issues however we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure strategic acquisitions and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver long term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2013 we expect total revenue growth from continuing operations of 10 to 12 as the impact of our acquisition of the csc credit services business will more than outweigh the negative impact of the expected decline in us mortgage volumes    29

cost of services from continuing operations increased 703 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 797 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million   the slight increase in cost of services from continuing operations in 2011 when compared to 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and benefits expense and contract services expenses of 311 million and by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 72 million largely offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business   selling general and administrative expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 702 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expense by 27 million   selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations increased 571 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased salary and incentive expense of 333 million higher advertising expenses of 91 million and higher severance costs offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling general and administrative expense by 52 million in 2011   depreciation and amortization the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce solutions   depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to 66 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam and our 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of talx in 2007 which fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the

      14pts        09pts    in 2012 operating expenses increased at a slightly faster rate than revenue and operating income increased at a lower rate than revenue due to a 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth   operating income from continuing operations for 2011 increased faster than revenue due to operating leverage from revenue growth and business mix as well as the deconsolidation of brazil which reduced reported revenue but which had little impact on operating profit because it had been operating near breakeven these factors resulted in operating margin

commercial paper to fund the acquisition of csc credit services the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2012 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a lower interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year period   interest expense decreased slightly in 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010 due to lower average debt balances outstanding for 2011 as compared to 2010 our consolidated debt balance increased at december 31 2011 as a result of

commercial paper outstanding on average throughout the year which caused the average cost of debt to increase as compared to the prior year period    other expense income net from continuing

of a high level of mortgage activity as well as certain new product pricing and market penetration initiatives implemented during 2011 and into 2012 we expect that the additional revenue in 2013 resulting from the acquisition of csc credit services will more than offset an anticipated decline in mortgagerelated revenue as a result of an expected market decline in mortgage origination volumes the increase in revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 was a result of growth across all of our uscis business lines   ocis 2012 revenue increased 17 when compared to the prior year about half of the increase resulted from increased volume and improved pricing in mortgage enduse markets while the other half came predominately from pricing and new product initiatives for the year core credit decision transaction volume increased by 4 while average revenue per transaction increased by 9 resulting from the increase in mortgage volume at higher than average pricing as a share of our overall mix and from specific market segment pricing initiatives while the remainder of our 17 growth came from products billed on a subscription basis and other revenue sources the increase in revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 was driven by increased market volume particularly in the credit card and auto markets new customer wins new service introductions and select pricing actions in subscription and wholesale arrangements an 11 increase in core credit decision transaction volumes was partially offset by lower average price per transaction for our transaction based revenue   mortgage solutions revenue increased 35 in 2012 when compared to 2011 due primarily to increased sales in core mortgage reporting services as a result of higher mortgage refinancings stimulated by historically low mortgage interest rates the sale of newer mortgage information products which help lenders better manage risk and growth in settlement services revenue as a result of the favorable market conditions and increased market share from existing customers revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of settlement services as a result of increased market share from existing customers partially offset by the declines in core mortgage reporting services due to lower refinancing activity as compared to the comparable periods of 2010   consumer financial marketing services revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulting from a decline in demand for wealthbased consumer information services due to reductions in their use for credit marketing by some large financial institutions this decrease was partially offset in by growth in traditional creditbased prescreen revenue and increased portfolio management revenue revenue for 2011 increased as compared to 2010 due to continued growth in creditbased prescreen and portfolio management revenue as well as strong market penetration of wealthbased consumer information services   us consumer information solutions operating margin uscis operating margins increased 110 basis points to 373 in 2012 due to the benefits of strong revenue growth in a business with significant fixed costs in 2011 improved margins in

these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants   we do not have any credit rating triggers that would

announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest   credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency   longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2012 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2011 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could

consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments         2 our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048        3 these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2013 and 2018     43          4 these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2012 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance        5 for future interest payments on variablerate debt which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2012 to calculate these payments our variable rate debt at december 31 2012 consisted of cp borrowings under our credit facilities and our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2012 through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2012 ranged from 04 to 21 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates        6 this table excludes 242 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities     44      offbalance sheet transactions   we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities   pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 884 million and 653 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company   letters of credit and guarantees   we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2012 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2012   benefit plans   we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 25 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan in 2011   at december 31 2012 the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip during the year ended december 31 2011 we made contributions of 400 million to the usrip we also contributed 37 million and 26 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities   for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap   for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report   seasonality   we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest    45      effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates   equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability   a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency   recent accounting pronouncements   for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report   application of critical accounting policies and estimates   the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes   if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met    46      the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract   we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract   many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract   we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance   we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction   deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies   judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services   in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported    47      effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue   goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets   we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have ten reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services tax management services part of employer services and talent management services part of employer services   the goodwill balance at december 31 2012 for our ten reporting units was as follows        december 31      2012      in millions   consumer information solutions  8932   id management   545   europe   1189   latin america   2193   canada consumer   311   north america personal solutions   18   north america commercial solutions   376   verification services   7389   tax management services   1690   talent management services   261   total goodwill  22904       in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we performed the qualitative assessment for our consumer information solutions latin america europe canada consumer north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units   judgments and uncertainties  in determining the fair value of our reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value      48      under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our competition discussion in item 1 of our 2012 annual report on form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information id management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation verification services tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies notably adp and paychex inc as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple   the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value   we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test   growth assumptions   the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our managements discussion and analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3 to 5 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve   we projected revenue growth in 2013 for our reporting units in completing our 2012 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units such as demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration in verification services and talent management services reporting units and not based on the assumption of meaningful economic recovery growth in the talent management services reporting unit is also based on growth in the commercial sector of that business the anticipated revenue growth in all of the reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2012 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units    49      discount rate assumptions   we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the companys tax rate for the 2012 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from 9 to 12 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit   estimated fair value and sensitivities   the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2012 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september 30 2012 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded   the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the companys reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2012 ranged from approximately 17 to 125   the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of 261 million as of september 30 2012 this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september 30 2012 if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecasted projected revenue growth for commercial customers does not materialize or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and would likely result in the recognition of an impairment loss additionally an increase in the discount rate due to outside factors or a decrease in the market multiples would likely result in an impairment   no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2012 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2012   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material    50      loss contingencies   we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote   judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material   income taxes   we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable   our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals   judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities   we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2012 242 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 114 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material   pension and other postretirement plans   we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost   judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material    51      we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan   the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2012 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 775 for the third time in the last four years however due to lower forecasted future returns the expected return for 2013 was reduced to 75 the crip earned 88 in 2012 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the third time in four years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for 2013 is 743 as compared to 767 which was the 2012 expected rate   annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5459 million at december 31 2012 we do not expect our 2013 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2012 cost excluding the pension settlement and curtailment recorded in 2012 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 767 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 417 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 13 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material   purchase accounting for acquisitions   we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income   judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations   on december 28 2012 we acquired csc credit services recorded total assets of 10 billion as of the acquisition date the assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to this acquisition   effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets    52
