franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earnedhotel and timeshare managementour core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs as of december 31 2013 we managed 498 hotels with 143771 rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage we provide management services for 42 timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 155 owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognize management fee revenuesfranchisingwe franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained and consult with franchisees concerning certain aspects of hotel operations we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2013 there were 3420 franchised hotels with 466642 rooms each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotels total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages8ownershipwe are among the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo sydney and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the waldorf astoria new york the hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel ownerswe have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best usetimeshareour timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sourcestimeshare saleswe market and sell timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties we also source timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers this allows us to sell timeshare units on behalf of thirdparty developers in exchange for sales marketing and branding fees on interval sales and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little upfront capital related to the construction of the propertyresort operationswe manage the hgv club receiving enrollment fees annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products we generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under our hgv club program we also earn revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare propertiesfinancingwe provide consumer financing which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loanshgvs primary product is a feesimple timeshare interest deeded in perpetuity this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2013 hgv managed a global system of 42 resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had more than 212000 members in totalcompetitionwe encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded owner operator manager and franchisor of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 9our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group fairmont raffles hotels international hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels amp resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporationin the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our competitors in the timeshare space include hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide corp starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resortsseasonalitythe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highestcyclicalitythe hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing marketintellectual propertyin the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and

concerning environmental compliance or contamination in addition to our hotel accommodations we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination or pursuant to our management or franchise agreements but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flowinsurancewe maintain insurance coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned hotels most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks these policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsured retentions or deductibles our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotelsus hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners or if not participating must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements nonus managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs all other insurance programs purchased by hotel owners must meet our requirements in addition our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of our hotelshistoryhilton worldwide holdings inc was incorporated

report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business risks relating to our business and industry we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world changes in operating costs including energy food compensation benefits and insurance increases in costs due to inflation that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business changes in tax and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage shortages of labor or labor disruptions the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligationsdelays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects which in the case of our managed and franchised hotels and timeshare properties controlled by homeowner associations are generally not within our control 12the quality of services provided by franchisees the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture agreements changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels or timeshare resorts in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services and vacation ownership services and products the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers and decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality services and timeshare products or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at properties that we manage franchise own lease or develop as well as demand for timeshare properties these factors include but are not limited to changes in general economic conditions including low consumer confidence unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy war political conditions or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities the financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes conditions which negatively shape public perception of travel including travelrelated accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and h1n1 swine flu cyberattacks climate change or availability of natural resources natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes typhoons floods volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers cyclical overbuilding in the hotel and timeshare industries and 13organized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected  the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis the general economy the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively competition for management and franchise agreements we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 14competition for sales of timeshare properties we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected  any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners businesses and their ability to make payments to us may indirectly depend on the strength and reputation of our brands such dependence makes our business susceptible to risks regarding brand obsolescence and to reputational damage if our brands become obsolete or are viewed as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and further we may be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners in addition many factors can negatively affect the reputation of any individual brand or the overall brand of our company changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events can have a substantial negative effect on our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could have a resulting negative effect on the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such incidents we could also face legal claims related to these events along with adverse publicity resulting from such litigation if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and on our ability to renew existing and enter into new management and franchise agreements the management and franchise contracts we enter into with thirdparty owners are typically longterm arrangements but may allow the hotel owner to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances including in certain cases the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition any negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth the ability to grow our management and franchise business is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management and franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised branded hotels is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability the availability of financing planning zoning and other local approvals other limitations that may be imposed by market factors include projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure any inability by us or our thirdparty owners to manage these factors effectively could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth  15if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed many of the properties owned by our thirdparty property owners are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into when such properties were purchased or refinanced by them if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property any such repossessions could result in the termination of our management and franchise agreements or eliminate revenues and cash flows from such property which could negatively affect our business and results of operations in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans with respect to existing hotels as well as result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining the quality and reputation of our branded hotel properties this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements and team members over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with such standards guest preference for our brands could diminish and this could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards and meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these relationships we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements at any given time we may be in disputes with one or more of our hotel owners any such dispute could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any thirdparty an adverse result in any of these proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination in the event of any such termination our fees from such properties would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations we are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate which could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions we own or lease a substantial amount of real property as one of our three business segments real estate ownership and leasing is subject to various risks that may or may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws  changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located losing value differences in potential civil liability between owners and operators for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties the ongoing need for ownerfunded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements 16risks associated with mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive which could reduce revenues or impair our ability to compete effectively certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties while we have budgeted for replacements and repairs to furniture fixtures and hotel equipment at our properties there can be no assurance that these replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials that may increase project costs obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes floods or tsunamis and design defects that could increase costs if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such properties were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects we share control in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of our joint venture assets in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the ventures therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the 17approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event such coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of such obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed under such obligations preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our return on these investments the timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation and failure to comply with such regulation may have an adverse effect on our business we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and we also service the resulting loans this practice subjects us to various federal and state regulations including those which require disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may not be able to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas and as a result the timeshare business could suffer a decline in revenues  a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition to timeshare interval inventory from our owned timeshare properties we source inventory through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval inventory available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval inventory could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management services to the timeshare properties if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 994 million of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure if the timeshare interval has declined in value we may incur impairment losses that reduce our profits in addition we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 18some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 1123 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases obtaining governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result our entire development pipeline may not develop into new hotelsnew hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we have launched several new brand concepts over the last few years we opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 launched the eforea spa at hilton brand in 2010 and opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 we may continue to build our portfolio of branded hotel products and nonhotel branded concepts by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brands will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in developing or expanding such brands and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters in addition substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility and any loss or damage to the facility could result in operational disruption and data loss damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide and the provision of information technology and business process services in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce 19fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationscyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our businessfrom time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations for example in 2011 we were notified by epsilon our database marketing vendor that we were among a group of companies served by epsilon that were affected by a data breach that resulted in an unauthorized third party gaining access to epsilons files that included names and emails of certain of our customers even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has increased in recent years any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us any such security breach could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our businesswe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests personal information we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes our various information technology systems enter process summarize and report such data if we fail to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely affected  in addition states and the federal government have recently enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert managements attention we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders spending cash and incurring debt assuming contingent liabilities or creating additional expenses 20we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may not be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon a sale of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally which govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests is booked through internet travel intermediaries we contract with such intermediaries and pay them various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems if such bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees although we have established agreements with many of these intermediaries that limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites in addition in general internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business however hospitality intermediaries have recently grown their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and it could also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business recent class action litigation against several online travel intermediaries and lodging companies including hilton challenges the legality under certain antitrust laws of certain provisions in contracts and alleged practices with thirdparty intermediaries while we are vigorously defending the litigation and believe the contract provisions are lawful the courts will 21ultimately determine this issue our fees and expenses associated with this litigation even if we ultimately prevail could be material any adverse outcome could require us to alter our business arrangements with these intermediaries and consequently could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online or by telephone to our call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guests charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 91 countries around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 25 percent and 27 percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including rapid changes in governmental economic and political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather natural disasters outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws  the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 22uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations given the nature of our business it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uks bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries in which we conduct operations if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners team members and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under us law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative impact on our results of operations 23the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of team members these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could negatively affect our operations collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies a significant number of our employees approximately 26 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 17 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies  labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels are staffed by approximately 152000 team members around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees our ability to manage and staff the managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 4700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services at any given time we also have a number of pending applications to register trademarks and other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or that the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful 24could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties such rights include the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use such intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages force us to stop using the intellectual property that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged intellectual property force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other agreements to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property divert managements attention and resources and limit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce certain of our exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates however these hedging agreements 25may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or which may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they can be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies  in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism insurance program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts on december 26 2007 the terrorism insurance program was extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 through december 31 2014 tripra we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if tripra is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2014 premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results certain of our buildings are also highly profitable properties to our business in addition to the effects noted above the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of these properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results 26of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we record tax expense based in part on our estimates of expected future tax rates reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 and october 24 2007 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 696 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irss position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 19 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for example in 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised exposure draft outlining proposed changes to current lease accounting in fasb accounting standards codification topic 840 leases the proposed accounting standards update if ultimately adopted in its current form could result in significant changes to current accounting including the capitalization of leases on the balance sheet that currently are recorded offbalance sheet as operating leases while this change would not affect the cash flow related to our leased hotels and other leased assets it could adversely affect our balance sheet and could therefore affect our ability to raise financing from banks or other sources changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operationsour total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 27governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing their relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result for example the us congress the us environmental protection agency and some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us the potential for changes in the frequency duration and severity of extreme weather events that may be a result of climate change could lead to significant property damage at our hotels and other assets affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in areas that are most vulnerable to such events such as the coastal resort areas where we operate and have a negative effect on revenues the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada under the terms of the settlement until november 2014 we must ensure compliance with ada regulations at our owned and joint venture in which we own more than a 50 interest properties built after january 26 1993 require managed or franchised hotels built after january 26 1993 that enter into a new management or franchise agreement experience a change in ownership or renew or extend a management or franchise agreement to conduct a survey of its facilities and to certify that the hotel complies with the ada ensure that new hotels constructed in our system are compliant with ada regulations provide ada training to our team members improve the accessibility of our websites and reservations system for individuals with disabilities appoint a national ada compliance officer and appoint an ada contact onsite at each hotel if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada and our related consent decree we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects which could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 28casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include location including proximity to or easy access from major population centers appearance local regional or national economic conditions which may limit the amount of disposable income that potential patrons may have for gambling the existence or construction of competing casinos dependence on tourism and governmental regulation jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including nevada new jersey puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2013 our total indebtedness was approximately 127 billion including 968 million of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively were 52 million 69 million and 622 million our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and pursue future business opportunitiesincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise 29exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations  certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan and the mortgage loan secured by our waldorf astoria new york property impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock pay dividends including to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock make certain investments incur certain liens enter into transactions with affiliates merge or consolidate enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and transfer or sell assets in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 30as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives  despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase risks related to ownership of our common stock our sponsor and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future our sponsor and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 764 of our common stock as of february 12 2014 moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates for so long as our existing owners and their affiliates retain significant ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the sponsor directors even when our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly for such period of time our sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example our sponsor owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta hotels and certain other investments in the hotel industry that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of our sponsor directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects 31that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you  we are a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements affiliates of our sponsor control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we are a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards such as requirements that within one year of the date of nyse listing a company have a board that is composed of a majority of independent directors as defined under nyse rules a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition although we have a fully independent audit committee and have independent director representation on our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize these controlled company exemptions accordingly our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements we will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses including costs associated with public company reporting requirements we also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sarbanesoxley act and related rules implemented by the sec and the nyse the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty these laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as our executive officers furthermore if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company we could be subject to delisting of our common stock fines sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected as a public company we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with our second annual report on form 10k we will be required to furnish reports by management and our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over 32financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources  because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends the declaration amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by our senior secured credit facility and our senior notes and may be limited by covenants of other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by our preipo investors may cause the market price of our common stock to declinesales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock after the expiration or earlier waiver or termination of the lockup periods described below substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be available for resale in the public market registration of the sale of these shares of our common stock would permit their sale into the market immediately the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell thempursuant to a registration rights agreement we have granted our sponsor and certain management stockholders the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 772 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them in connection with our initial public offering we our executive officers directors and holders of certain of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering including our sponsor that collectively owned approximately 778 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 signed lockup agreements with the underwriters of the initial public offering that subject to certain customary exceptions restrict the sale of the shares of our common stock held by them for 180 days following the date of the initial public offering prospectus subject to extension in the case of an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us deutsche bank securities inc and goldman sachs amp co may in their sole discretion release all or any portion of the shares of common stock subject to lockup agreements in addition former members of hilton global holdings llc hgh including our sponsor who received in the aggregate approximately 829481530 shares of our common stock or approximately 842 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 from hgh in connection with our initial public offering are prohibited from transferring such shares for six months beginning on their receipt of such shares on the date of the pricing of our initial public offering one third of the shares they received approximately 276493843 shares may be transferred between 6 and 12 months following the date of receipt and an additional one third of the shares they receive approximately 276493843 shares may be transferred between 13 and 18 months after the date of receipt the transfer restrictions applicable to such holders will lapse after 18 months after the date of receipt in addition while transfer restrictions applicable to former members of hgh currently provide for the restrictions described above these contractual provisions may be waived modified or amended at any timeas of february 12 2014 we had granted 19500 restricted stock units to our independent directors under our 2013 omnibus incentive plan an aggregate of 79980500 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the 2013 omnibus incentive plan as of february 12 2014 we have filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities 33act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2013 omnibus incentive plan accordingly shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open marketas restrictions on resale end the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securitiesantitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which the parties to our stockholders agreement cease to beneficially own at least 40 percent of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office these provisions provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote andthese provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desireitem 1b unresolved staff commentsnoneitem 2

believe the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty we believe we have adequate reserves against such matters we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations 38or liquidity however depending on the amount and timing an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period in re online travel company otchotel booking antitrust litigation we are a defendant in a federal multidistrict litigation currently pending in the us district court for the northern district of texas which consolidates 30 previously separate actions originally filed in federal courts between august 2012 and february 2013 the consolidated amended complaint alleges that approximately a dozen hotel and online travel company defendants engaged in an anticompetitive scheme to fix the prices of hotel rooms in violation of federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws in february 2014 the court dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims under rule 12b6 on the basis that there were no facts to support the allegations the plaintiffs have 30 days to file for permission to amend their complaint we dispute the allegations and will continue to vigorously defend our interests as necessary we currently do not believe the ultimate outcome of this litigation

awardwinning customer loyalty program hilton hhonors segments and regionsmanagement analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services management and franchise ownership and timeshare the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment generates revenue from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the timeshare segment consists of multiunit vacation ownership properties this segment generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties providing consumer financing and resort operationsgeographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nationsas of december 31 2013 approximately 77 percent of our systemwide hotel rooms were located in the us we expect that the percentage of our hotel rooms outside the us will continue to increase in future years as hotels in our pipeline open system growth and pipelineto support our growth strategy we continue to expand our development pipeline as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 1123 hotels in our development pipeline representing 194572 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 76 countries and territories as of december 31 2013 101810 rooms representing 52 percent of our development pipeline were under construction of the 194572 rooms in the pipeline 117361 rooms representing 60 percent of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2013 over 99 percent of the rooms under construction and in our total pipeline were within our management and franchise segment and only one development project was within our ownership segment we do not consider that project or any individual development project relating to properties under our management and franchise segment to be material to us 44our management and franchise contracts are designed to expand our business with limited or no capital investment the capital required to build and maintain hotels that we manage or franchise is typically provided by the owner of the respective hotel with minimal or no capital required by us as the manager or franchisor additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capitalrecent eventsinitial public offeringon december 17 2013 we completed our ipo in which we sold 64102564 shares of

indebtedness in connection with the debt refinancingfor more information on these transactions see liquidity and capital resources as well as note 13 debt and note 14 deferred revenues in our consolidated financial statements principal components and factors affecting our results of operationsrevenuesprincipal componentswe primarily derive our revenues from the following sourcesowned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from hotel operations including room rentals food and beverage sales and other ancillary services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure our group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions sponsored by associations corporate social military educational religious or other organizations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as catering and banquet services a majority 45of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenuesmanagement and franchise fees and other represents revenues derived from management fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties managed by us franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands and other revenue generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised properties and other rental incometerms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and in some cases an incentive fee which is based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed amount as stated in the management agreement outside of the us our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee additionally we receive onetime upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts in general the hotel owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years extensions are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually or in comparison to specified hotels under our franchise agreements franchisees pay us franchise fees which consist of initial application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system and monthly royalty fees generally calculated as a percentage of room revenues royalty fees for our fullservice brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable in addition to the franchise application and royalty fees franchisees also generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the cost of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation system expenses and quality assurance program costs our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our option the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damagestimeshare represents revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare units and revenues from enrollments and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties and fees which we refer to as resort operations additionally in recent years we began a transformation of our timeshare business to a capital light model in which thirdparty timeshare owners and developers provide capital for development while we act as the sales and marketing agent and property manager through these transactions we receive a sales and marketing commission and branding fees on sales of timeshare intervals recurring fees to operate the homeowners associations and revenues from resort operations other revenues from managed and franchised properties these revenues represent the payroll and its related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net income46factors affecting our revenuesthe following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operationsconsumer demand and global economic conditions consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks affecting or reducing travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to increase rates charged to customers at our hotels also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profit measures our timeshare segment also is linked to cycles in the general economy and consumer discretionary spending as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject and have subjected our revenues to significant volatilityour results of operations have steadily improved as the global economy continues to recover resulting in an increase in systemwide revpar of 88 percent from the year ended december 31 2011 to the year ended december 31 2013agreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers we depend on our longterm management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise agreements and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees relating to hotels in the pipeline are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party additionally in recent years we have entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare units on behalf of thirdparty developers our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 73000 or 78 percent of total supply as of december 31 2013 we expect sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers and resort operations to comprise a growing percentage of our timeshare revenue and revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare units developed by us to comprise a smaller percentage of our timeshare revenue in future periods consistent with our strategy to focus our business on the management aspects and deploy less of our capital to asset construction expensesprincipal componentswe primarily incur the following expensesowned and leased hotels owned and leased hotel expenses reflect the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expense food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products other support expenses consist of costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurancetimeshare timeshare expenses include the cost of inventory sold during the period sales and marketing expenses resort operations expenses and other overhead expenses associated with our timeshare businessdepreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings furniture fixtures and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels as well as certain corporate assets amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of our management and franchise intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives additionally we amortize capitalized software over the estimated useful life of the software47general administrative and other expenses general administrative and other expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments including divisional offices that support our management and franchise segment professional fees including consulting audit and legal fees travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses contractual performance obligations and office administrative and related expenses expenses incurred by our supply management business laundry facilities and other ancillary businesses are also included in general administrative and other expenses impairment losses we hold significant amounts of goodwill amortizing and nonamortizing intangible assets longlived assets and investments we evaluate these assets for impairment as further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates these evaluations have in the past resulted in impairment losses for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the assets and our estimates of fair value based on economic conditions or other factors at a propertyspecific or companywide level we may be required to take additional impairment losses to reflect further declines in our asset andor investment valuesother expenses from managed and franchised properties these expenses represent the payroll and its related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties the corresponding revenues are presented as other revenues from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net incomefactors affecting our costs and expensesthe following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with managing franchising and owning hotels and timeshare resorts are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities as well as sales and marketing expenses for our timeshare segment if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flow margins and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth economic downturns generally affect the results of our owned and leased hotel segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segments due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts is limited by the fixed costs inherent in our business as a result we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs or to defer or cancel capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we feel are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands also a significant portion of our costs to support our timeshare business relates to direct sales and marketing of these units in periods of decreased demand for timeshare units we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profit margins on our timeshare businesschanges in depreciation and amortization expense changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to record additional depreciation expense on those assets additionally we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expense will increase48other itemseffect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationssignificant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periodsseasonalitythe lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter producing the strongest revenues of the yearkey business and financial metrics used by managementcomparable hotelswe define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone or planned to undergo largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4073 hotels in our system as of december 31 2013 3548 have been classified as comparable hotels our 525 noncomparable hotels include 14 properties or less than one percent of the total hotels in our system that have been removed from the comparable group during the last year because they have sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 3926 hotels in our system as of december 31 2012 3484 have been classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2012 occupancyoccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreasesaverage daily rateadr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described aboverevenue per available roomwe calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at our hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels references to revpar and adr throughout this report are presented on a currency neutral all periods using the same exchange rates and comparable basis unless otherwise noted49ebitda and adjusted ebitdaebitda presented herein is a financial measure that is not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap that reflects net income attributable to hilton stockholders excluding interest expense a

the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industryebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as

increases in occupancy and adr the addition of new hotels to our managed and franchised system also contributed to the growth in revenue during 2013 we added 45 managed properties on a net basis contributing an additional 10196 rooms to our system as well as 108 franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 16084 rooms to our system as new hotels are established in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periodsother revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were 60 million and 56 million respectively the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenues received from our supply management businesstimeshare timeshare revenue increased 24 million due to an increase of approximately 63 million in sales commissions generated from projects developed by third parties as a result of three properties comprising 1049 units commencing sales during or after the year ended december 31 2012 additionally there was an increase of approximately 9 million in revenue from our resort operations primarily due to increases in club fees and room rentals as well as an increase of approximately 9 million in financing and other revenues primarily due to increases in portfolio interest income these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately 57 million in revenue from the sale of timeshare units developed by us due to lower sales volume of our owned timeshare inventory which we expect to continue as we further develop our capital light timeshare business with a

december 31 2013 we had total cash and cash equivalents of 860 million including 266 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balances relates to cash collateral on our selfinsurance programs and escrowed cash from our timeshare operations our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits legal costs operating costs associated with the management of hotels interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our owned and leased hotels our longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities capital improvements at our owned and leased hotels purchase commitments costs associated with potential acquisitions and corporate capital expenditureswe finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations we believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating expenses and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits legal costs and purchase commitments for the foreseeable future the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity minimize operational costs and use available cash to pay down our outstanding debt further we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments across all three of our business segments additionally we have no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2013 and we have the ability to borrow up to 957 million after giving effect to 43 million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facilityrecent events affecting our liquidity and capital resourcesinitial public offeringon december 17 2013 we completed our ipo which generated net proceeds of approximately 1243 million to us after underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs which we used in conjunction with available cash to repay approximately 1250 million of the term loans debt refinancingupon completion of the debt refinancing we repaid in full all 134 billion in borrowings under our legacy senior mortgage loans and secured mezzanine loans and redeemed the full 96 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our bonds due 2031 using the proceeds from our offering of 15 billion of senior notes borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility which consists of the 76 billion term loans and the 10 billion revolving credit facility the 35 billion cmbs loan and a 525 million waldorf astoria loan together with additional borrowings of 300 million under our timeshare facility and cash on hand for further information on the debt refinancing see note 13 debt in our consolidated financial statements hilton hhonors points sales in october 2013 we sold hilton hhonors points to amex and citi for 400 million and 250 million respectively in cash amex and citi and their respective designees may use the points in connection with hilton hhonors cobranded credit cards and for promotions rewards and incentive programs or certain other activities as they may establish or engage in from time to time we used the net proceeds of the hilton hhonors points sales to reduce outstanding

current assets less total current liabilitiesour ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 111 120 and 137 as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectivelyoperating activities cash flow from operating activities is primarily generated from management and franchise revenues operating income from our owned and leased hotels and resorts and sales of timeshare units in a recessionary market we may experience significant declines in travel and thus declines in demand for our hotel and resort rooms and timeshare units a decline in demand could have a material effect on our cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 2101 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1110 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 991 million increase was primarily due to 650 million received from the hilton hhonors points sales which increased our deferred revenues and improved operating income excluding noncash share based compensation expense of 262 million net cash provided by operating activities also increased during the year ended december 31 2013 as a result of the releases of 42 million in collateral against outstanding letters of credit and 20 million of restricted cash from our timeshare operations additionally during the year ended december 31 2012 our cash provided by operating activities was reduced by 76 million for collateral required to support potential future contributions to certain of our employee benefit plans for further discussion see note 20 employee benefit plans in our consolidated financial statementsthe net 57 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to changes in various working capital components and an increase in the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents of 65 million which were partially offset by an increase in operating income of 125 millioninvesting activitiesnet cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 was 382 million compared to 558 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the 176 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment of 179 million as a result of the completion of renovations at certain of our owned and leased properties in 2012 and a decrease in software capitalization costs of 25 million as a result of corporate software projects that were completed in 2012 additionally there was an increase in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates of 25 million primarily related to the sales of our interests in two joint venture entities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of 30 million primarily due to the acquisition of a parcel of land that we previously held under a longterm ground lease for 28 million the 95 million increase in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment of 44 million a decrease in proceeds from asset dispositions of 65 million and a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates of 15 million the majority of the increase in capital expenditures related to improvements at existing hotel properties the decrease in proceeds from asset dispositions was a result of proceeds of 65 million from the sale of our former corporate headquarters office building in 2011 while the decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates resulted from 64the sale of our interest in a joint venture entity of 8 million in 2012 compared to proceeds from the sale of our interest in a hotel development joint venture of 23 million in 2011 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we capitalized labor costs relating to our investing activities including capital expenditures and software development of 15 million 14 million and 14 million respectivelyfinancing activitiesnet cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 was 1863 million compared to 576 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the 1287 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a 2357 million increase in net repayments of debt primarily related to an increase in unscheduled voluntary debt repayments on our secured debt the repayment of the secured debt in connection with the debt refinancing and unscheduled voluntary repayments of 350 million on our term loans subsequent to the debt refinancing the increase in net debt repayments was offset by 1243 million in proceeds from our ipo which was used to repay amounts outstanding on our term loans additionally we paid 180 million of debt issuance costs related to the debt refinancing net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 138 million compared to the year ended december 31 2011 due to a change in restricted cash and cash equivalents that increased cash available for financing activities by 212 million as well as an increase in borrowings of 56 million primarily related to our consolidated vies the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease of 174 million in our prefunded cash reserves which was a result of using the reserves for capital expenditures the increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by an increase in our debt repayments of 128 million which primarily related to an increase in nonrecourse debt repayments related to our consolidated vies of 90 millioncapital expendituresour capital expenditures for property and equipment of 254 million 433 million and 389 million made during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

million during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding commitments under construction contracts of approximately 121 million for capital expenditures at certain owned and leased properties including our consolidated vies our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work if cancellation of a contract occurred our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract senior secured credit facilityour revolving credit facility provides for 10 billion in borrowings including the ability to draw up to 150 million in the form of letters of credit as of december 31 2013 we had 43 million of letters of credit outstanding on our revolving credit facility leaving us with a borrowing capacity of 957 million we are

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2013 was 435 million these amounts are excluded from the table above because they are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next year refer to note 19 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements further discussion of our liability for unrecognized tax benefitsin addition to the purchase commitments in the table above in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income and cash flowoffbalance sheet arrangementsour offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2013 included letters of credit of 51 million guarantees of 27 million for debt and obligations of third parties performance guarantees with possible cash outlays totaling approximately 150 million of which we have accrued 60 million as of december 31 2013 for estimated probable exposure and construction contract commitments of approximately 121 million for capital expenditures at our owned leased and consolidated vie hotels additionally during 2010 in conjunction with a lawsuit settlement an affiliate of our sponsor entered into service contracts with the plaintiff as part of the settlement we entered into a guarantee with the plaintiff to pay any shortfall that this affiliate does not fund related to those service contracts the remaining potential exposure under this guarantee as of december 31 2013 was approximately 48 million see note 25 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these amountscritical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the 66reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operationsmanagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directorsproperty and equipment and intangible assets with finite liveswe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment lossesas part of the process described above we exercise judgment todetermine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific informationdetermine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group these estimated growth rates are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources anddetermine the asset fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerationswe had 9058 million of property and equipment net and 2203 million of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2013 changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be materialin conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any property and equipment with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows would result in impairment losses we did not identify any intangible assets with finite lives for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows projected operating results or other significant assumptions would result in impairment losses67investments in affiliateswe evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investments fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationsour investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own andor operate hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above if there are indicators of potential impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment abovewe had 260 million of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our investments in affiliates impairment testing can result in additional impairment expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statementsin conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment lossesgoodwillwe review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 24 business segments in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we evaluate the fair value of our reporting units quantitatively when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combinationwe had 6220 million of goodwill as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each reporting units by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of our reporting units68brandswe evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models for hotels that we manage or franchise under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losseswe had 5013 million of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each of our brands by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of the brand intangible assetshilton hhonorshilton hhonors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per staywe had 963 million of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability a 10 percent decrease to the breakage estimate used in determining future award redemption obligations would increase our guest loyalty liability by approximately 30 millionallowance for loan lossesthe allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rateswe had 92 million of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2013 changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance a 10 percent increase to our default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for loan losses by approximately 35 millionincome taxeswe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statementswe use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the morelikelythannot designation changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax expense benefit which can materially change our consolidated financial statements69legal contingencieswe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statementsconsolidationswe use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in our partnerships and other investments including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or have a controlling general partner interest of a partnership assuming the absence of other factors determining control including the ability of minority owners to participate in or block certain decisions changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statementssharebased compensationin connection with our ipo the equity based portion of our former executive compensation plan was modified to vested shares and unvested restricted shares of common stock and the liability portion of the plan was settled in cash the equity based award was exchanged for vested shares and unvested restricted shares of our common stock as follows40 percent of each award vested on december 11 2013 the pricing date of our ipo40 percent of each award will vest on december 11 2014 the first anniversary of the pricing date of our ipo contingent upon continued employment through that date and20 percent of each award will vest on the date that our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own 50 percent or more of the shares of the company contingent upon continued employment through that datewe recognized sharebased compensation over the requisite service period of the individual grantee which generally equals the vesting period we currently only have service condition awards outstanding and we have elected to use the straightline method of expense attribution for such awards the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions including forfeiture rates we monitor the forfeiture activity to ensure that the current estimate continues to be appropriate any changes to this estimate will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to any future grantsitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes interest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt interest rates on our variablerate debt discussed below are based on onemonth and threemonth libor so we are most vulnerable to changes in this rate 70under the terms of the cmbs loan and waldorf astoria loan entered into in connection with the debt refinancing we are required to hedge interest rate risk using derivative instruments under the cmbs loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the variablerate component or 875 million which caps onemonth libor at 60 percent for the initial term of the variablerate component under the waldorf astoria loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the loan or 525 million which caps onemonth libor at 40 percent for the first 24 months thereafter we are required to renew the interest rate cap agreement annually as of december 31 2013 the fair value of these interest rate caps were immaterial to our consolidated balance sheetadditionally on october 25 2013 we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of 145 billion with a term of five years which swapped the floating threemonth libor on a portion of the term loans to a fixed rate of 187 percent the carrying value and fair value of these four interest rate swaps was 10 million as of december 31 2013the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values

financial interest including variable interest entities vies where we are the primary beneficiary entities in which we have a controlling financial interest generally comprise majority owned real estate ownership and management enterprisesthe determination of a controlling financial interest is based upon the terms of the governing agreements of the respective entities including the evaluation of rights held by other ownership interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or have a controlling general partner interest of a partnership assuming the absence of other factors determining control including the ability of noncontrolling owners to participate in or block certain decisions as of december 31 2013 we consolidated six nonwholly owned entities in which we

america us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and accordingly ultimate results could differ from those estimatesreclassificationscertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation 79summary of significant accounting policiesrevenue recognitionrevenues are primarily derived from the following sources and are generally recognized as services are rendered and when collectibility is reasonably assured amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilitiesowned and leased hotel revenues primarily consist of room rentals and food and beverage sales from owned leased and consolidated nonwholly owned hotel properties revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or renderedmanagement fees represent fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties that we manage usually under longterm contracts with the property owner management fees from hotels usually include a base fee which is generally a percentage of hotel revenues and an incentive fee which is typically based on a fixed or variable percentage of hotel profits and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period additionally we receive onetime upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts we recognize base fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management agreement for incentive fees we recognize those amounts that would be due if the contract was terminated at the financial statement date onetime upfront fees are recognized when all conditions have been substantially performed or satisfied by us management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed percent as stated in the management agreement and are recognized as the services are performedfranchise fees represent fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our hotel brands usually under longterm contracts with the hotel owner we charge a monthly franchise royalty fee generally based on a percentage of room revenue as well as application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system royalty fees for our fullservice brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable we recognize franchise fee revenue as the fees are earned which is when all material services or conditions have been performed or satisfiedother revenues include revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels and other rental income this includes any revenues received for vendor rebate arrangements we participate in as a manager of hotel and timeshare propertiestimeshare revenues consist of revenues generated from our hilton grand vacations timeshare business timeshare revenues are principally generated from the sale and financing of timeshare intervals revenue from a deeded timeshare sale is recognized when the customer has executed a binding sales contract a minimum ten percent down payment has been received certain minimum sales thresholds for a timeshare project have been attained the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired and the related receivable is deemed to be collectible we defer revenue recognition for sales that do not meet these criteria during periods of construction revenue from timeshare sales is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method one of our timeshare products is accounted for as a longterm lease with a reversionary interest rather than the sale of a deeded interest in real estate in this case sales revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease revenue from the financing of timeshare sales is recognized on the accrual method as earned based on the outstanding principal interest rate and terms stated in each individual financing agreement see financing receivables section below for further discussion of the policies applicable to our timeshare financing receivables additionally we receive sales commissions from certain thirdparty developers that we assist in selling their timeshare inventory we recognize revenue from commissions on these sales as intervals are sold and we fulfill the service requirements under the respective sales agreements with the developers we also generate revenues from enrollment and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties that are recognized when units are rented or goods and services are delivered or renderedother revenues from managed and franchised properties represent payroll and related costs certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income loss or net income loss 80we are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis we have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent we do not retain these taxes and fees and therefore they are not included in revenues we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agencycash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities when purchased of three months or lessrestricted cash and cash equivalentsrestricted cash and cash equivalents include cash balances established as security for certain guarantees lender reserves ground rent and property tax escrows reserves statutorily required to be held by our captive insurance subsidiary and advance deposits received on timeshare sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closed for purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents caused by changes in lender reserves due to restrictions under our loan agreements are shown as financing activities the remaining changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents are the result of our normal operations and as such are reflected in operating activitiesallowance for doubtful accountsan allowance for doubtful accounts is provided on accounts receivable when losses are probable based on historical collection activity and current business conditionsinventoriesinventories comprise unsold timeshare intervals at our timeshare properties as well as hotel inventories consisting of operating supplies that have a period of consumption of one year or less guest room items and food and beverage itemstimeshare inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market based on the relative sales value or net realizable value capital expenditures associated with our nonlease timeshare products are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold consistent with industry practice timeshare inventory is classified as a current asset despite an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months the majority of sales and marketing costs incurred to sell timeshare intervals are expensed when incurred certain direct and incremental selling and marketing costs are deferred on a contract until revenue from the interval sale has been recognizedin accordance with the accounting standards for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects we use the relative sales value method of costing our timeshare sales and relieving inventory in addition we continually assess our timeshare inventory and if necessary impose pricing adjustments to accelerate sales pace it is possible that any future changes in our development and sales strategies could have a material effect on the carrying value of certain projects and inventory we monitor our projects and inventory on an ongoing basis and complete an evaluation each reporting period to ensure that the inventory is stated at the lower of cost or markethotel inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost using firstin firstout or fifo or marketproperty and equipmentproperty and equipment are recorded at cost and interest applicable to major construction or development projects is capitalized costs of improvements that extend the economic life or improve service potential are also capitalized capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives costs for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurreddepreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally as follows buildings and improvements 8 to 40 years furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years and computer equipment and acquired software 3 years leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life based on the lives estimates above or the lease termwe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment if there are indicators of potential impairment we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the assets carrying value by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash 81flows to the net book value of the asset if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses fair value is generally estimated using valuation techniques that consider the discounted cash flows of the asset using discount and capitalization rates deemed reasonable for the type of asset as well as prevailing market conditions appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offersif sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation including environmental remediation liabilities we recognize the fair value of the obligation when the obligation is incurred which is generally upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the assetfinancing receivableswe define financing receivables as financing arrangements that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates which are recognized as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets we record all financing receivables at amortized cost in current and longterm financing receivables we recognize interest income as earned and provide an allowance for cancellations and defaults we have divided our financing receivables into two portfolio segments based on the level of aggregation at which we develop and document a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses based on their initial measurement risk characteristics and our method for monitoring and assessing credit risk we have determined the classes of financing receivables to correspond to our identified portfolio segments as followstimeshare financing receivables comprise loans related to our financing of timeshare interval sales and secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we recognize interest income on our timeshare financing receivables as earned the interest rate charged on the notes correlates to the risk profile of the borrower at the time of purchase and the percentage of the purchase that is financed among other factors we record an estimate of uncollectibility as a reduction of sales revenue at the time revenue is recognized on a timeshare interval sale we evaluate this portfolio collectively since we hold a large group of homogeneous timeshare financing receivables which are individually immaterial we monitor the credit quality of our receivables on an ongoing basis there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties with the exception of the financing provided to customers of our timeshare business we do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates aging and historical writeoffs of these receivables the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on a periodic analysis of the mortgage portfolio once a note is 90 days past due or is determined to be uncollectible prior to 90 days past due we cease accruing interest and reverse the accrued interest recognized up to that point we apply payments we receive for loans including those in nonaccrual status to amounts due in the following order servicing fees late charges interest and principal we resume interest accrual for loans for which we had previously ceased accruing interest once the loan is less than 90 days past due we fully reserve for a timeshare financing receivable in the month following the date that the loan is 120 days past due and subsequently we write off the uncollectible note against the reserve once the foreclosure process is complete and we receive the deed for the foreclosed unitother financing receivables primarily comprise individual loans and other types of unsecured financing arrangements provided to hotel owners we individually assess all financing receivables in this portfolio for collectibility and impairment we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows we do not recognize interest income on unsecured financing to hotel owners for notes that are greater than 90 days past due and only resume interest recognition if the financing receivable becomes current we fully reserve unsecured financing to hotel owners when we determine that the receivables are uncollectible and when all commercially reasonable means of recovering the receivable balances have been exhaustedinvestments in affiliateswe hold investments in affiliates that primarily own or lease hotels under one of our nine distinct hotel brands if the entity does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate our voting interest or general partnership interest to determine if we have a controlling financial interest in the entity investments in affiliates over which we exercise significant influence but lack a 82controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method we account for investments using the equity method when we own more than a minimal investment but have no more than a 50 percent voting interest or do not otherwise control the investment investments in affiliates over which we are not able to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost methodour proportionate share of earnings losses from our equity method investments is presented as equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations distributions from investments in unconsolidated entities are presented as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return on investment distributions from unconsolidated affiliates are recorded as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return of investmentwe assess the recoverability of our equity method and cost method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if an investment may have an otherthantemporary impairment we assess the fair value of the investment based on accepted valuation methodologies which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationsgoodwillgoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized we do not amortize goodwill but rather evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying amountwe review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 24 business segments we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units the valuation is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excessbrandswe own operate and franchise hotels under our portfolio of brands there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of these brands and accordingly the useful lives of these brands are considered to be indefinite our hotel brand portfolio includes waldorf astoria hotels amp resorts conrad hotels amp resorts hilton hotels amp resorts doubletree by hilton including doubletree suites by hilton embassy suites hotels hilton garden inn hampton inn including hampton inn amp suites and outside of the us hampton by hilton homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton in addition we also develop and operate timeshare properties under our hilton grand vacations brandat the time of the merger our brands were assigned a fair value based on a common valuation technique known as the relief from royalty approach home2 suites by hilton was launched postmerger and as such it was not assigned a fair value we evaluate our brands for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses83intangible assets with finite useful liveswe have certain finite lived intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of the merger these intangible assets consist of management agreements franchise contracts leases certain proprietary technologies and our guest loyalty program hilton hhonors additionally we capitalize management and franchise contract

liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date an exit price we use the threelevel valuation hierarchy for classification of fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below level 1  valuation is based upon quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level 2  valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the instrument level 3  valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurementthe classification of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety84derivative instrumentswe use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we regularly monitor the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to our derivative instruments under the terms of our loan agreements we are required to maintain derivative financial instruments to manage interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we record all derivatives at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered we designate the derivative as one of the following a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid cash flow hedge a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge a hedge of our foreign currency exposure net investment hedge or an undesignated hedge instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flowsif we determine that we qualify for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument at the designation date we formally document all relationships between hedging activities including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and determining the foreign currency exposure of net investment of the foreign operation for a net investment hedgeon a quarterly basis we assess the effectiveness of our designated hedges in offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations via use of the hypothetical derivative method this method compares the cumulative change in fair value of each hedging instrument to the cumulative change in fair value of a hypothetical hedging instrument which has terms that identically match the critical terms of the respective hedged transactions thus the hypothetical hedging instrument is presumed to perfectly offset the hedged cash flows ineffectiveness results when the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical hedging instrument we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable or the hedging instrument expires is sold terminated or exercisedcurrency translationthe united states dollar usd is our reporting

compensationwe recognize the cost of services received in a sharebased payment transaction with an employee as services are received and recognize either a corresponding increase in equity or a liability depending on whether the instruments granted satisfy the equity or liability classification criteriathe measurement objective for these equity awards is the estimated fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments that we are obligated to issue when employees have rendered the requisite service and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments the compensation cost for an award classified as an equity instrument is recognized ratably over the requisite service period including an estimate of forfeitures the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an awardliability awards under a sharebased payment arrangement are measured based on the awards fair value and the fair value is remeasured at each reporting date until the date of settlement compensation cost for each period until settlement is based on the change or a portion of the change depending on the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered at the reporting date in the fair value of the instrument for each reporting period including an estimate of forfeiturescompensation cost for awards with performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied if such performance conditions are not considered probable until they occur no compensation expense for these awards is recognizedincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year to recognize the deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate to tax consequences in future years which result from differences between the respective tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and tax loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the respective temporary differences or operating loss or tax credit carry forwards are expected to be recovered or settled the realization of deferred tax assets and tax loss and tax credit carry forwards is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income and other restrictions that may exist under the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which a deferred tax asset exists valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realizedwe use a prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return for all income tax positions we first determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if it is determined that a position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50

paper the estimated fair values were based on available market pricing information of similar financial instrumentsthe estimated fair value of our timeshare financing receivables were based on the expected future cash flows discounted at riskadjusted rates the primary sensitivity in these estimates is based on the selection of appropriate discount rates fluctuations in these assumptions will result in different estimates of fair value an increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the fair value we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value which were estimated using an income approach the primary inputs into our fair value estimate include interest rates and yield curves based on observable market inputs of similar instrumentsthe estimated fair value of our level 1

value of our level 3 variablerate longterm debt was based on estimates of market spreads when quoted market values did not exist on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same maturities or quoted market prices for the same or similar issues in determining the current market rate for the fixed rate debt a market spread was added to the quoted yields on federal government treasury

operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this assessment we provided a valuation allowance of 3 million and 440 million as of december 31 2013 on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards respectively our valuation allowance decreased 266 million during the year ended december 31 2013105we classify reserves for tax

changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were primarily the result of items identified resolved and settled as part of our ongoing us federal audit we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense we accrued approximately 4 million 8 million and 6 million during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had accrued approximately 45 million and 42 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were 340 million and 374 million respectively associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax rate as a result of the expected resolution of examination issues with federal state and foreign tax authorities we believe it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease up to 15 millionwe file income tax returns including returns for our subsidiaries with federal state and foreign jurisdictions we are under regular and recurring audit by the internal revenue service irs on open tax positions the timing of the resolution of tax audits is highly uncertain as are the amounts if any that may ultimately be paid upon such resolution changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits appeals or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdictions or from the resolution of various proceedings between the us and foreign tax authorities we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examination for years through 2004 as of december 31 2013 we remain subject to federal examinations from 20052012 state examinations from 19992012 and foreign examinations of our income tax returns for the years 1996 through 2012 during 2009 the irs commenced its audit of our predecessors consolidated us income tax returns for the 2006 through october 2007 tax years in 2013 we received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs for such years primarily relating to assertions by the irs that 1 certain foreign currencydenominated intercompany loans from our foreign subsidiaries to certain us subsidiaries should be recharacterized as equity for us federal income tax purposes and constitute deemed dividends from such foreign subsidiaries to our us subsidiaries 2 in calculating the amount of us taxable income resulting from our hilton hhonors guest loyalty program we should not reduce gross income by the estimated costs of future redemptions but rather such costs would be deductible at the time the points are redeemed and 3 certain foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our luxembourg subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar should instead be treated as issued by one of our belgian subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and thus foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such loans should have been measured in euros instead of us dollars in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in additional us federal tax owed of approximately 696 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes the portion of this amount related to our hilton hhonors guest loyalty program would result in a decrease to our future tax liability when the points are redeemed we disagree with the irss position on each of these assertions and intend to vigorously contest them we plan to pursue all available administrative remedies and if we are not able to resolve these matters administratively we plan to pursue judicial remedies accordingly as of december 31 2013 no accrual has been made for these amountsstate income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return however the state impact of any federal tax return changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period generally of up to one year after formal notification to the states the statute of limitations for the foreign jurisdictions generally ranges from three to ten years after filing the respective tax return on september 13 2013 treasury and the irs issued final regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property the final regulations under internal revenue code sections 162 167 and 263a apply to amounts paid to acquire produce or improve tangible property as well as dispositions of such property and are generally effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2014 we have evaluated these regulations and determined they will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 106note 20 employee benefit plans we sponsor multiple domestic and international employee benefit plans benefits are based upon years of service and compensationwe have a noncontributory retirement plan in the us the domestic plan which covers certain employees not earning union benefits this plan was frozen for participant benefit accruals in 1996 therefore the projected benefit obligation is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation plan assets will be used to pay benefits due to employees for service through december 31 1996 as employees have not accrued additional benefits since that time we do not utilize salary or pension inflation assumptions in calculating our benefit obligation for the domestic plan the annual measurement date for the domestic plan is december 31we also have multiple employee benefit plans that cover many of our international employees these include a plan that covers workers in the united kingdom the uk plan which was frozen to further accruals on november 30 2013 and a number of smaller plans that cover workers in various countries around the world the international plans the annual measurement date for all of these plans is december 31we are required to recognize the funded status the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit

december 31 2013 the multiple employer plan had combined assets of 342 million and a projected benefit obligation of 446 million a class action lawsuit was filed in 1998 against hilton and the domestic plan claiming that the domestic plan did not calculate benefit obligations in accordance with the terms of the plan nor were vesting rules followed in accordance with the plan in may 2009 the us district court for the district of columbia the district court found in favor of the plaintiff in a summary judgment and required that we and the plaintiff enter into mediation to reach agreement on the amounts necessary for recognition of service and benefits for plan participants and in august 2011 the district court issued a final order with respect to this lawsuit we recorded an increase to our minimum additional pension obligation of 109 million as of december 31 2012 to reflect the expected increase in benefit obligation relating to this case the additional obligation will be recognized as additional pension expense which will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants as determined by our actuaries with the unamortized portion of the obligation having been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as an adjustment of the pension liability as of december 31 2013 the remaining unpaid projected benefit obligation related to this case was 86 millionin november 2013 the district court issued final administrative orders in regard to the lawsuit which allowed hilton to adopt an amendment to the domestic plan required by the court the adoption of the amendment required us to make a contribution of 31 million in november 2013 prior to the amendment to comply with minimum legal funding obligations of the domestic plan we expect to commence benefit payments under the new plan document in early 2014 in accordance with the requirements of the court order in february 2012 the district court ordered us to post bond of 76 million under the litigation to support potential future plan contributions we funded an account which is classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents with this amount to support this requirement and expect that the bond will be released upon the commencement of benefit payments being made under the amended plan document in 2014uk planin march 2012 we along with the trustees of the uk plan adopted an agreement to freeze the defined benefit plan for enrollment to new employees effective immediately and to freeze the accrual of benefits to existing employees which was implemented on november 30 2013 a defined contribution plan has been put in place for the affected employees we recognized an acceleration of prior service credit of 13 million related to the adoption of this agreement during the year ended december 31 2012in may 2011 we along with the trustees for the uk plan reached a tentative agreement on the funded status and security for the uk plan this agreement extended our gbp 15 million guarantee equivalent to 25 million as of december 31 2013 to march 2014 and included a onetime voluntary cash contribution of gbp 5 million equivalent to approximately 8

it is unlikely that material payments will be required under these guarantees or letters of credit there can be no assurance that this will be the casewe have also provided performance guarantees to certain owners of hotels that we operate under management contracts most of these guarantees allow us to terminate the contract rather than fund shortfalls if specified performance levels are not achieved however in limited cases we are obligated to fund performance shortfalls as of december 31 2013 we had six contracts containing performance guarantees with expirations ranging from 2018 to

consisting of restricted stock units under our 2013 omnibus incentive plan that will vest over one to two years based on service conditions to certain nonexecutive employees that had participated in
