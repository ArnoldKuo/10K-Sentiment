leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest7ownershipwe are one of the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel ownerswe have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use management and franchisethrough our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earnedhotel and timeshare managementour core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of the hotels gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2015 we managed 544 hotels with 158848 rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties the initial terms of our management agreements for full service hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage as of december 31 2015 we provided management services for 45 timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 146 owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues revenues from our owned and leased hotels are eliminated in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k8franchisingwe franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2015 we franchised 3875 hotels with 533039 rooms each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotels total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damagestimeshareour timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sourcestimeshare saleswe market and sell timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties we also source timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers this allows us to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers using the hilton grand vacations brand in exchange for sales marketing and branding fees on interval sales and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little upfront capital related to the construction of the propertyresort operationswe manage the hgv club receiving enrollment fees annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products we generate rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under our hgv club program we also earn revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare propertiesfinancingwe provide consumer financing which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loanshgvs primary product is the marketing and selling of feesimple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity developed either by us or by third parties this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2015 hgv managed a global system of 45 resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had nearly 250000 members in totaltraditionally timeshare operators have funded 100 percent of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties in 2010 we began sourcing timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers these agreements enable us to generate fees from the sales and marketing of the timeshare intervals and club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction costs in addition we source intervals by acquiring units in thirdparty developed properties which requires less capital than constructing timeshare properties our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 114000 or 85 9percent of our total supply as of december 31 2015 and the percentage of sales of timeshare intervals developed by third parties was 66 percent for the year ended december 31 2015competitionwe encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor owner and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and operator of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels amp resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporationin the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our primary competitors in the timeshare space include diamond resorts international hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resortsseasonalitythe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarterscyclicalitythe hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing marketintellectual propertyin the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality10government regulationour business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain

generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our

information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business risks related to our business and industry we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world changes in operating costs including energy food employee compensation and benefits and insurance increases in costs due to inflation that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs 12the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage shortages of labor or labor disruptions the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligationsdelays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects the quality of services provided by franchisees the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture agreementscyclical overbuilding in the hotel and timeshare industries changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels or timeshare resorts in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services and vacation ownership services and products anddecreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at properties that we manage franchise own lease or develop as well as demand for timeshare properties these factors include but are not limited to changes in general economic conditions including low consumer confidence unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy war political conditions or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities the financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes 13conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel including travelrelated accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as ebola avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and h1n1 swine flu cyberattacks climate change or availability of natural resources natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes typhoons floods volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers andorganized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected  the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury full service and focused service hotels and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and 14redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer competition for management and franchise agreements we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced competition for timeshare sales we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange their owned interval for use of other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected  any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our managed owned leased or timeshare properties can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the recent expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected our management and franchise business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty hotel owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 15our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth growth of our management and franchise business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business  if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a hotel owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions we own or lease a substantial amount of real property which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws  loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located 16increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties the ongoing need for ownerfunded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements risks associated with mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes floods or tsunamis or acts of terrorism and design defects that could increase costs if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 17we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments our timeshare business is subject to risks associated with regulation thirdparty owners and providing financing to purchasersthe timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition because we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and also service the resulting loans as well as the loans on inventory sold by thirdparty developers for which we provide marketing services we are subject to various federal and state regulations including those requiring disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may be unable to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas which could result in a decline in timeshare revenues  a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition to timeshare interval supply from our owned timeshare properties we source interval supply through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval supply available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval supply could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management loan and collection services to the timeshare properties 18if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 1082 million of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects as of december 31 2015 we had a total of 1616 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our systemnew hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we launched a new midscale brand tru by hilton in january 2016 we introduced a new brand canopy by hilton in october 2014 opened our first curio  a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 and opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we move production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of 19these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationscyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our businessfrom time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents in november 2015 we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some pointofsale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware we expect we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our businesswe are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests personal data and other sensitive information we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards  in addition states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 20we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert managements attention we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders spending cash and incurring debt assuming contingent liabilities or creating additional expenses we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 21the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our agreements with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channelsin addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers or through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guests charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 22because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 100 countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 22 percent and 25 percent of our revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including rapid changes in governmental economic and political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws  the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws uncertainties as to local laws regarding and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uks bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under 23the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies a significant number of our employees approximately 31 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 11 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 24labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage approximately 164000 individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to manage and staff the managed owned and leased hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 5100 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages force us to stop using the intellectual property that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged intellectual property force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services 25require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other agreements to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property limit our ability to develop new intellectual property andlimit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at allfollowing the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable26terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 through december 31 2010 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irss position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 18 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 27changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operationsour total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on usthe cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital 28expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include location including proximity to or easy access from major population centers appearance local regional or national economic and political conditions the existence or construction of competing casinos dependence on tourism and governmental regulation jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  risks related to our proposed spinoffsthe proposed spinoffs of our ownership business and timeshare business are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management and may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not they are completedon february 26 2016 we announced a plan to pursue a separation of a substantial portion of our ownership business consisting primarily of our owned hotels located in the us the ownership business and our timeshare business into separate publiclytraded companies through spinoffs the proposed spinoffs are subject to customary conditions including but not limited to the receipt of opinions concerning the taxfree nature of the transactions and the qualification of the entity holding the ownership business as a real estate investment trust a reit for us federal income tax purposes effectiveness 29of appropriate filings with the securities and exchange commission and final approval by our board of directors in addition ability to execute the transaction as intended unanticipated developments or changes in the macroeconomic environment credit markets and equity markets as well as other market conditions may affect our proposed spinoffs for these and other reasons we may not complete the spinoffs as expected or at allwhether or not we complete the spinoffs our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the spinoffs including among others the following  execution of the proposed spinoffs will require significant time and attention from management which may distract them from the operation of our business and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to usour employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spinoffs we will be required to pay significant costs and expenses relating to the spinoffs such as legal accounting and other professional fees whether or not the spinoffs are completed andwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spinoffsany of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the price of our common stockwe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffsalthough we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spinoffs will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoffs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits for example if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us and our stockholders in addition we will incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoffs including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the spunoff businesses will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoffs or if our costs exceed our estimates the company or the businesses that are spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on their business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsif the proposed spinoffs of our ownership business and our timeshare business are completed the trading price of our common stock will declinewe expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spinoffs which will only represent the value of our remaining management and franchise business to be lower than immediately prior to the spinoffs because the trading price for our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our ownership business and our timeshare businessfollowing the spinoffs the aggregate value of your common stock of the company and the businesses that are spun off may be less than the aggregate value at which the companys common stock might have traded had the spinoffs not occurredthe common stock of the company and the businesses that are spun off that you may hold following the spinoffs may collectively trade at an aggregate value less than the value at which the companys common stock might have traded had the spinoffs not occurred due to among other factors the expected or actual future performance of either the company or the businesses that are spun off as separate independent companies and the future stockholder base and market for the companys common stock and the shares of the businesses that are spun offthe proposed spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholdersthe spinoffs are conditioned on an opinion of tax counsel regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and will not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if 30any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling is based is incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling is based are materially different from the facts that prevail at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion will similarly rely on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution will be considered to have been described in that initial request we believe the legislation will not apply to the spinoff of our ownership business however no ruling will be obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of our ownership business either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or the entity holding the ownership business would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoffif the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new spinoff companies would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares receivedrisks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2015 our total indebtedness was approximately 105 billion including 726 million of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively were 227 million 285 million and 3493 million our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and pursue future business opportunitiesincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 31we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations  certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock pay dividends including to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock make certain investments incur certain liens enter into transactions with affiliates merge or consolidate enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and transfer or sell assets in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 32servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives  despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase risks related to ownership of our common stock blackstones interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 459 percent of our common stock as of december 31 2015 moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders agreement with blackstone for so long as it retains specified levels of ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by blackstone thus for so long as blackstone continues to own specified percentages of our stock it will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time blackstone will have influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as blackstone continues to own a significant percentage of our stock it may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock blackstone and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities blackstone and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example blackstone owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta holdings inc and certain other investments in the hotel industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of blackstone directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you  33we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules however we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a oneyear transition period as a result our stockholders do not yet have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to those requirements until may 2015 blackstone controlled a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we were a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards and has one year following ceasing to be a controlled company to comply with all of nyses corporate governance standardsbecause of these nyse transition rules for companies that cease to be controlled companies we are not required to have our nominating and corporate governance committee consist entirely of independent directors until may 2016 we intend to continue to utilize the nyses transition period for companies that are no longer controlled companies accordingly our stockholders do not yet have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirementswhile we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time our board of directors declared our first quarterly dividend in july 2015 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant  future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors may cause the market price of our common stock to declinesales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock in addition blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stockpursuant to a registration rights agreement blackstone and certain management stockholders have the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 467 percent of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2015 these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them in addition as of december 31 2015 we had 9251754 shares of common stock to be issued upon vesting or exercise of outstanding equitybased awards and an aggregate of 68627645 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2013 omnibus incentive plan we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2013 omnibus incentive plan accordingly shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open marketantitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of 34undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which the parties to our stockholders agreement cease to beneficially own at least 40 percent of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office these provisions provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote andthese provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desireitem 1b unresolved staff commentsnone35
