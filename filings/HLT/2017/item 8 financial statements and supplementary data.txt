controlling financial interest including variable interest entities vies where we are the primary beneficiary entities in which we have a controlling financial interest generally comprise majority owned real estate ownership and management enterprisesthe determination of a controlling financial interest is based upon the terms of the governing agreements of the respective entities including the evaluation of rights held by other ownership interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or otherwise have a controlling financial interestall material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation references in these financial statements to net income loss attributable to hilton stockholders and hilton stockholders equity deficit do not include noncontrolling interests which represent the outside ownership interests of our consolidated nonwholly owned entities and are reported separately78use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states of america us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and accordingly ultimate results could differ from those estimatessummary of significant accounting policiesrevenue recognitionrevenues are primarily derived from the following sources and are generally recognized as services are rendered and when collectibility is reasonably assured amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilitiesowned and leased hotel revenues primarily consist of room rentals food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services from owned leased and consolidated nonwholly owned hotel properties revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or renderedmanagement fees represent fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties that we manage usually under longterm contracts with the property owner and homeowners associations management fees from hotels usually include a base fee which is generally a percentage of hotel revenues and an incentive fee which is typically based on a fixed or variable percentage of hotel profits and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period we recognize base fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management agreement for incentive fees we recognize those amounts that would be due if the contract was terminated at the financial statement date management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed percent as stated in the management agreement and are recognized as the services are performedfranchise fees represent fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our hotel brands usually under longterm contracts with the hotel owner we charge a monthly franchise royalty fee generally based on a percentage of room revenue as well as application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system royalty fees for our full service brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable we also earn fees when certain franchise agreements are terminated early or there is a change in ownership application and initiation fees are recognized when all services and conditions have been substantially performed or satisfied by us generally upon execution of the agreement we recognize royalty and other franchise fees as the fees are earned which is when all material services or conditions have been performed or satisfiedother revenues include revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels including purchasing operations and other rental income this includes any revenues received for vendor rebate arrangements we participate in as a manager of hotel and timeshare propertiestimeshare revenues consist of revenues generated from our hilton grand vacations timeshare business timeshare revenues are principally generated from the sale and financing of feesimple timeshare intervals deeded in perpetuity developed or acquired either by us or by third parties revenue from a deeded timeshare sale is recognized when the customer has executed a binding sales contract a minimum 10 percent down payment has been received certain minimum sales thresholds for a timeshare project have been attained the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired and the related receivable is deemed to be collectible we defer revenue recognition for sales that do not meet these criteria during periods of construction revenue from timeshare sales is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method in this case sales revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease additionally we receive sales commissions from certain thirdparty developers that we assist in selling their timeshare inventory we recognize revenue from commissions on these sales as intervals are sold and we fulfill the service requirements under the respective sales agreements with the developers revenue from the financing of timeshare sales is recognized on the accrual method as earned based on the outstanding principal interest rate and terms stated in each individual financing agreement we record an estimate of uncollectible accounts as a reduction of sales revenue at the time revenue is recognized on a timeshare interval sale see the financing receivables section below for further discussion of the policies applicable to our timeshare financing receivables we also generate revenues from club enrollment and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties that are recognized when units are rented or goods and services are delivered or rendered79other revenues from managed and franchised properties represent payroll and related costs certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income loss or net income loss we are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis we have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent we do not retain these taxes and fees and therefore they are not included in revenues we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agencycash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities when purchased of three months or lessrestricted cash and cash equivalentsrestricted cash and cash equivalents include cash balances established as security for certain guarantees lender reserves ground rent and property tax escrows insurance deposits for assets we plan to acquire and advance deposits received on timeshare sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closedallowance for doubtful accountsan allowance for doubtful accounts is provided on accounts receivable when losses are probable based on historical collection activity and current business conditionsinventoriesinventories include unsold completed timeshare intervals timeshare intervals under construction and land and infrastructure held for future timeshare interval development at our timeshare properties collectively timeshare inventory as well as hotel inventories consisting of operating supplies that have a period of consumption of one year or less guest room items and food and beverage itemstimeshare inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell based on the relative sales value capital expenditures associated with our timeshare intervals are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold consistent with industry practice timeshare inventory is classified as a current asset despite an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months the majority of sales and marketing costs incurred to sell timeshare intervals are expensed when incurred certain direct and incremental selling and marketing costs are deferred on a contract until revenue from the interval sale has been recognizedin accordance with the accounting standards for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects we use the relative sales value method of costing our timeshare sales and relieving inventory in addition we continually assess our timeshare inventory and if necessary impose pricing adjustments to modify sales pace it is possible that any future changes in our development and sales strategies could have a material effect on the carrying value of our timeshare inventory and purchase commitments for timeshare inventory we monitor our projects and inventory on an ongoing basis and complete an evaluation each reporting period to ensure that the inventory and purchase commitments for inventory are at the lower of cost or markethotel inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost using firstin firstout or fifo or net realizable valueproperty and equipmentproperty and equipment are recorded at cost and interest applicable to major construction or development projects is capitalized costs of improvements that extend the economic life or improve service potential are also capitalized capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives costs for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred80depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally as follows buildings and improvements 8 to 40 years furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years and computer equipment 3 to 5 years leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life based on the estimates above or the lease termwe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment if there are indicators of potential impairment we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the assets carrying value by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses fair value is generally estimated using valuation techniques that consider the discounted cash flows of the asset using discount and capitalization rates deemed reasonable for the type of asset as well as prevailing market conditions appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offersif sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation including environmental remediation liabilities we recognize the fair value of the obligation when the obligation is incurred which is generally upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the assetbusiness combinationswe consider a business combination to occur when the company takes control of a business by acquiring its net assets or equity interests we record the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests at fair value as of the acquisition date including any contingent consideration we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected future cash flows discounted at riskadjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate fair value of the assets acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are expensed in the period incurred and are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assetsfinancing receivableswe define financing receivables as financing arrangements that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates which are recognized as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets we record all financing receivables at amortized cost in current and longterm financing receivables we recognize interest income as earned and provide an allowance for cancellations and defaults we have divided our financing receivables into two portfolio segments based on the level of aggregation at which we develop and document a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for loan losses based on their initial measurement risk characteristics and our method for monitoring and assessing credit risk we have determined the classes of financing receivables to correspond to our identified portfolio segments as followstimeshare financing receivables comprise loans related to our financing of timeshare interval sales and secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we recognize interest income on our timeshare financing receivables as earned the interest rate charged on the notes correlates to the risk profile of the borrower at the time of purchase and the percentage of the purchase that is financed among other factors we monitor the credit quality of our receivables on an ongoing basis we evaluate this portfolio collectively for uncollectibility since we hold a large group of homogeneous timeshare financing receivables which are individually immaterial there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance for loan loss is determined by management through analysis of several factors such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates aging and historical writeoffs of these receivables the allowance for loan loss is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on a periodic analysis of the mortgage portfolio once a note is 90 days past due or is determined to be uncollectible prior to 90 days past due we cease accruing interest and reverse the accrued interest recognized up to that point we apply payments we receive for loans including those in nonaccrual status to amounts due in the following order servicing fees late charges interest and principal we resume interest accrual for loans for which we had previously ceased accruing interest once the loan is less than 90 days past due we fully reserve for a timeshare financing receivable in the month following the date that the loan is 120 days past due and subsequently we write off the uncollectible note against the reserve once the foreclosure process is complete and we receive the deed for the foreclosed unit81other financing receivables primarily comprise individual loans and other types of unsecured financing arrangements provided to hotel owners we individually assess all financing receivables in this portfolio for collectibility and impairment we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows we do not recognize interest income on unsecured financing to hotel owners for notes that are greater than 90 days past due and only resume interest recognition if the financing receivable becomes current we fully reserve unsecured financing to hotel owners when we determine that the receivables are uncollectible and when all commercially reasonable means of recovering the receivable balances have been exhaustedinvestments in affiliateswe hold investments in affiliates that primarily own or lease hotels under one of our distinct hotel brands if we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity we account for the investment using the equity or cost method we account for investments using the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity typically through a more than minimal investment investments in affiliates where we own less than a minimal investment and are not able to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost methodour proportionate share of earnings losses from our equity method investments is presented as equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations distributions from investments in unconsolidated entities are presented as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return on investment distributions from unconsolidated affiliates are recorded as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return of investmentwe assess the recoverability of our equity method and cost method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if an investment may have an otherthantemporary impairment we assess the fair value of the investment based on accepted valuation methodologies which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationsin connection with the october 24 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of blackstone the merger we recorded our equity method investments at their estimated fair value which resulted in an increase to our historical basis in those entities primarily as a result of an increase in the fair value of the real estate assets of the investee entities the basis difference is being amortized as a component of equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates over a period of approximately 40 yearsgoodwillgoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized we do not amortize goodwill but rather evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying amountas part of the merger we recorded goodwill representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the other identified assets and liabilities we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23 business segments we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units the valuation is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds 82the implied fair value of that goodwill the excess is recognized within impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operationsbrandswe own operate and franchise hotels under our portfolio of brands there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of these brands and accordingly the useful lives of these brands are considered to be indefinite our hotel brand portfolio includes hilton hotels amp resorts waldorf astoria hotels amp resorts conrad hotels

hilton in addition we also develop and operate timeshare properties under our hilton grand vacations brandat the time of the merger our brands were assigned a fair value based on a common valuation technique known as the relief from royalty approach canopy by hilton curio  a collection by hilton tru by hilton and home2 suites by hilton were launched postmerger and as such they were not assigned fair values we evaluate our brands for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment lossesintangible assets with finite useful liveswe have certain finite lived intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of the merger these intangible assets consist of management agreements franchise contracts leases certain proprietary technologies and our guest loyalty program hilton honors additionally we capitalize direct and incremental management and franchise contract acquisition costs as finitelived intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their respective estimated useful liveswe capitalize costs incurred to develop internaluse computer software and costs to acquire software licenses internal and external costs incurred in connection with development of upgrades or enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized these capitalized costs are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these capitalized costs are recorded in other intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheetswe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operationshilton honorshilton honors is a guest loyalty program provided to hotels and timeshare properties nearly all of our owned leased managed and franchised hotels and timeshare properties participate in the hilton honors program hilton honors members earn points based on their spending at our participating hotels and timeshare properties and through participation in affiliated partner programs when points are earned by hilton honors members the property or affiliated partner pays hilton honors based on an estimated cost per point for the costs of operating the program which include marketing promotion communication administration and the estimated cost of award redemptions hilton honors member points are accumulated and may be redeemed for the right to stay at participating properties as well as for other goods and services from third parties including but not limited to airlines car rentals cruises vacation packages shopping and dining we provide hilton honors as a marketing program to participating hotels and timeshare properties with the objective of operating the program on a breakeven basis to ushilton honors records a liability related to revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that include historical experience an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of reimbursing hotels and other third parties in respect to other redemption opportunities available to members revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts only when points that have been redeemed for hotel stay certificates are used by members or their designees at the respective properties additionally when 83members of the hilton honors loyalty program redeem award certificates at our owned and leased hotels we recognize room revenue included in owned and leased hotels revenues in our consolidated statements of operationsfair value measurements  valuation hierarchyfair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date an exit price we use the threelevel valuation hierarchy for classification of fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the data market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized belowlevel 1  valuation is based upon quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the instrumentlevel 3  valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurementthe classification of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety proper classification of fair value measurements within the valuation hierarchy is considered each reporting period the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amountsderivative instrumentswe use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we regularly monitor the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to our derivative instruments under the terms of certain loan agreements we are required to maintain derivative financial instruments to manage interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we record all derivatives at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered we may designate the derivative as one of the following a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid cash flow hedge a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of our foreign currency exposure net investment hedge changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings if we do not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings likewise the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flowsif we determine that we qualify for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument at the designation date we formally document all relationships between hedging activities including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and determining the foreign currency exposure of the net investment of the foreign operation for a net investment hedgeon a quarterly basis we assess the effectiveness of our designated hedges in offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using the hypothetical derivative method this method compares the cumulative change in fair value of each hedging instrument to the cumulative change in fair value of a hypothetical hedging instrument 84which has terms that identically match the critical terms of the respective hedged transactions thus the hypothetical hedging instrument is presumed to perfectly offset the hedged cash flows ineffectiveness results when the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical hedging instrument we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge

performance conditions are not considered probable until they occur no compensation expense for these awards is recognizedincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year to recognize the deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate to tax consequences in future years which result from differences between the respective tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the respective temporary differences or operating loss or tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the realization of deferred tax assets and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income and other restrictions that may exist under the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which a deferred tax asset exists valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately

accounting standards update asu no 201615 asu 201615 statement of cash flows topic 230  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments this asu addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230  restricted cash this asu requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the provisions of both asus are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and are to be applied retrospectively early adoption is permitted we elected as permitted by the standards to early adopt asu 201615 and asu 201618 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we restated all prior periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the adoption of asu 201615 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements the effect of the adoption of asu 201618 on our consolidated statements of cash flows was to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances in the beginning and end of period balances of cash restricted cash and cash equivalents the change in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents was previously disclosed in operating activities investing activities and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs this asu requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt 86liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset which is consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and premiums in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201515 asu 201515 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530  presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements which clarifies that absent authoritative guidance in asu 201503 for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements the staff of the sec would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement we adopted asu 201503 and asu 201515 retrospectively as of january 1 2016 as a result approximately 94 million of debt issuance costs that were previously presented in other noncurrent assets as of december 31 2015 are now included within longterm debt and timeshare debt we elected to continue presenting the debt issuance costs related to our lineofcredit arrangements within other noncurrent assetsin february 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 asu 201502 consolidation topic 810  amendments to the consolidation analysis this asu modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model we elected as permitted by the standard to adopt asu 201502 as of january 1 2016 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of january 1 2016 of approximately 5 million additionally certain consolidated entities that were not previously considered vies prior to the adoption of asu 201502 were considered to be vies for which we are the primary beneficiary and continue to be consolidated following adoption prior period vie disclosures do not include the balances or activity associated with these viesaccounting standards not yet adoptedin february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 asu 201602 leases topic 842 which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in leases topic 840 and generally requires all leases including operating leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position as rightofuse assets and lease liabilities by lessees the provisions of asu 201602 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect that this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements but we expect this asu to have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheetin may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 this asu supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in revenue recognition topic 605 and requires entities to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services subsequent to asu 201409 the fasb has issued several related asus the provisions of asu 201409 and the related asus will be effective for us beginning january 1 2018 and adoption as of the original effective date of january 1 2017 is permitted we will not early adopt the new standard this asu permits two transition approaches retrospective or modified retrospective we are still evaluating our transition approach and expect to reach a decision in early 2017 we anticipate that asu 201409 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements however we expect revenue recognition related to our accounting for ongoing royalty and management fee revenues and direct reimbursable fees from our management and franchise agreements and hotel guest transactions at our owned and leased hotels to remain substantially unchanged while we are continuing to assess all other potential effects of the standard we currently believe the provisions of asu 201409 will affect revenue recognition as follows i application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system will be recognized over the term of the franchise agreement ii certain contract acquisition costs related to our management and franchise agreements will be recognized over the term of the agreements as a reduction to revenue and iii incentive management fees will be recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur as a result of future hotel profits or cash flows we do not expect the changes in revenue recognition for certain contract acquisition costs or incentive management fees to affect the companys net income for any full year period we are currently assessing the effect of the standard on indirect reimbursable fees related to our management and franchise agreements and the accounting for our guest loyalty program we continue to update our assessment of the effect that asu 201409 and related asus will have on our consolidated financial statements and we will disclose further material effects if any when known87note 3 acquisitions tax deferred exchangeduring the year ended december 31 2015 we used proceeds from the sale of the waldorf astoria new york to acquire as part of a tax

subsidiaries in preparation for the spinoffs and ii a restructuring of hiltons international assets and subsidiaries the international restructuring the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets including intellectual property used in the international business from us subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016 the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated us tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign jurisdictions further our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities our estimated deferred effective tax rate has increased in total these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of 513 million during the three months ended december 31 2016after the 2016 international restructuring based on our consideration of all available positive and negative evidence we determined that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize the benefit of various foreign deferred tax assets accordingly as of december 31 2016 we released valuation allowances of 32 million against our foreign deferred tax assetsduring the year ended december 31 2015 certain of our us subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies and certain of our subsidiary controlled foreign corporations elected to be disregarded for us federal income tax purposes these transactions were treated as taxfree liquidations for federal tax purposes as a result of these liquidation transactions 512 million of deferred tax liabilities were derecognized in addition we recognized 128 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets associated with assets and liabilities distributed from the liquidated controlled foreign 102corporations resulting in a total deferred tax benefit of 640 million these previously unrecognized deferred tax assets were a component of our investment in foreign subsidiaries deferred tax balances that were connected to the liquidated controlled foreign corporations prior to these liquidations we did not believe that the benefit of these deferred tax assets would be realized within the foreseeable future therefore we did not recognize these deferred tax assets deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities plus carryforward items the tax

tax assets as of december 31 2016 resulted from net operating loss carryforwards that are not subject to expiration we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this assessment we provided a valuation allowance of 385 million as of december 31 2016 on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards our total valuation allowance relating to these net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets increased 16 million

2currency translation adjustment 4 3balance at end of year253 407 401103the changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were primarily the result of items identified resolved and settled as part of our ongoing us federal audit we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had accrued approximately 31 million and 27 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties we accrued approximately 4 million 5 million and 8 million during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 217 million and 377 million respectively associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax rate as a result of the expected resolution of examination issues with federal state and foreign tax authorities we believe it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease up to 8 millionwe file income tax returns including returns for our subsidiaries with federal state and foreign jurisdictions we are under regular and recurring audit by the internal revenue service irs on open tax positions the timing of the resolution of tax audits is highly uncertain as are the amounts if any that may ultimately be paid upon such resolution changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits appeals or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdictions or from the resolution of various proceedings between the us and foreign tax authorities we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examination for years through 2004 as of december 31 2016 we remain subject to federal examinations from 20052015 state examinations from 20032015 and foreign examinations of our income tax returns for the years 1996 through 2015 in april 2014 we received 30day letters from the irs and the revenue agents report rar for the 2006 and october 2007 tax years we disagreed with several of the proposed adjustments in the rar filed a formal appeals protest with the irs and did not make any tax payments related to this audit the issues being protested in appeals relate to assertions by the irs that 1 certain foreign currencydenominated intercompany loans from our foreign subsidiaries to certain us subsidiaries should be recharacterized as equity for us federal income tax purposes and constitute deemed dividends from such foreign subsidiaries to our us subsidiaries 2 in calculating the amount of us taxable income resulting from our hilton honors guest loyalty program we should not reduce gross income by the estimated costs of future redemptions but rather such costs would be deductible at the time the points are redeemed and 3 certain foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our luxembourg subsidiaries whose functional currency is usd should instead be treated as issued by one of our belgian subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and thus foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such loans should have been measured in euros instead of usd additionally in january 2016 we received a 30day letter from the irs and the rar for the december 2007 through 2010 tax years the rar includes the proposed adjustments for tax years december 2007 through 2010 which reflect the carryover effect of the three protested issues from 2006 through october 2007 these proposed adjustments will also be protested in appeals and formal appeals protests have been submitted in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in additional us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes the portion of this amount related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program would result in a decrease to our future tax liability when the points are redeemed we disagree with the irss position on each of these assertions and intend to vigorously contest them however as a result of recent developments related to the appeals process discussion that have taken place in 2016 we have determined based on ongoing discussions with the irs it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the full benefit related to certain of the issues being appealed accordingly as of december 31 2016 we have recorded a 44 million unrecognized tax benefit state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing the respective return however the state effect of any federal tax return changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period generally of up to one year after formal notification to the states the statute of limitations for the foreign jurisdictions generally ranges from three to ten years after filing the respective tax returnnote 19 employee benefit plans we sponsor multiple domestic and international employee benefit plans benefits are based upon years of service and compensationwe have a noncontributory retirement plan in the us the domestic plan which covers certain employees not earning union benefits this plan was frozen for participant benefit accruals in 1996 therefore the projected benefit obligation is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation the plan assets will be used to pay benefits due to employees for service through december 31 1996 as employees have not accrued additional benefits since that time we do not utilize salary or pension inflation assumptions in calculating our benefit obligation for the domestic plan the annual measurement date for the domestic plan is december 31we also have multiple employee benefit plans that cover many of our international employees these include i a plan that covers workers in the united kingdom the uk plan which was frozen to further service accruals on november 30 2013 104and ii a number of smaller plans that cover workers in various countries around the world the international plans the annual measurement date for all of these plans is december 31we are required to recognize the funded status of our pension plans which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations in our consolidated balance sheets and make corresponding adjustments for changes in the value through accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax the following table presents the projected benefit obligation the fair value

interest in park or hgv however we entered into certain agreements that provide a framework for our relationship with them including a transition services agreement an employee matters agreement and a tax matters agreement with park and hgv as well as management and franchise agreements with park and a license agreement with hgv beginning in the first quarter of 2017 commensurate with the
