which we own a noncontrolling interest also includes 67 owned and leased hotels that were owned by park effective january 3 2017 as a result of the completion of the spinoffs7ownershipas of december 31 2016 we were one of the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties included a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo and tokyo the portfolio included iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel owners as noted in the overview section on january 3 2017 we completed the spinoff of a portfolio of 67 of our owned and leased hotels and resorts to park in continuation of this strategy these hotels will continue to be a part of the hilton system as managed and franchised properties pursuant to management and franchise agreements entered into in connection with the spinoffsas a hotel owner we focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we activated options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use management and franchisethrough our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earnedhotel and timeshare managementour core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of the hotels gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2016 we managed 559 hotels with 165320 rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties the initial terms of our management agreements for full service hotels typically are 20 to 30 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other partys option or by mutual agreement in the case of our management agreements with park assuming we exercise all renewal periods the total term of the management agreements will range from 30 to 70 yearssome of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotels performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage as of december 31 2016 we provided management services for 47 timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 141 owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues revenues from our owned and leased hotels are eliminated in our audited consolidated 8financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k following the spinoff of hgv we no longer provide management services to the timeshare propertiesfranchisingwe franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2016 we franchised 4175 hotels with 573404 rooms each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotels total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services our franchise agreements for new construction and our franchise agreements with park typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years and properties that are converted from other brands have initial terms of approximately 10 to 20 years at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years our franchise agreements with park cannot be extended without our consent we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisees default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damagestimesharehgv our previously owned timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sourcestimeshare saleshgv markets and sells timeshare interests previously owned by hilton and third parties hgv also sources timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers this allows hgv to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers using the hilton grand vacations brand in exchange for sales marketing and branding fees on interval sales and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little upfront capital related to the construction of the propertyresort operationshgv manages the hgv club receiving enrollment fees annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products hgv generates rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under the hgv club program hgv also earns revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare propertiesfinancinghgv provides consumer financing which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loanshgvs primary product is the marketing and selling of fee simple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity developed either by us or by third parties this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton honors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 4300 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition hgv operates the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2016 hgv managed a global system of 47 resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had nearly 270000 members in total as noted in the overview section on january 3 2017 we completed the spinoff of our timeshare business and these timeshare properties will remain in hiltons system as franchised properties pursuant to a license agreement with hgv9competitionwe encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor owner and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and operator of hotels with an associated systemwide customer loyalty platform makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts and wyndham worldwide corporationseasonalitythe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarterscyclicalitythe hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing marketintellectual propertyin the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic

egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictionsfinally as an international owner operator and franchisor of hospitality properties in 104 countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and

reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals in addition some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uks bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operationsenvironmental matterswe are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination in addition to our hotel accommodations we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise agreements but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flowinsuranceus hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements nonus managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of hotels owned by such third partiesmost of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance 11coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels in addition through our captive insurance subsidiary we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles in general our

factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business risks related to our business and industry we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world changes in operating costs including energy food employee compensation and benefits and insurance increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage shortages of labor or labor disruptions the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligationsdelays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects the quality of services provided by franchisees the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture agreementscyclical overbuilding in the hotel industry changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services anddecreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 13macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to changes in general economic conditions including low consumer confidence unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy governmental action and uncertainty resulting from us and global political trends including potential barriers to travel trade and immigration war political conditions or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activitiesthe financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel including travelrelated accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as ebola zika avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and h1n1 swine flu cyberattacks climate change or availability of natural resources natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes typhoons floods volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers andorganized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected  14the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury full service and focused service hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer competition for management and franchise agreements we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 15our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements or enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business  if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer substantially all of our management and franchise agreements as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation 16the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects as of december 31 2016 we had a total of 1968 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our systemnew hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we launched a new upscale brand tapestry collection by hilton in january 2017 and a new midscale brand tru by hilton in january 2016 we introduced a new brand canopy by hilton in october 2014 opened our first curio  a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 and opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions although we recently completed the spinoff of park we still own or lease real property which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties includinggovernmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws  loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties the ongoing need for ownerfunded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties and to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements risks associated with any mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets 17the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes floods or tsunamis or acts of terrorism and design defects that could increase costs if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the non18performance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton honors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations19cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our businessfrom time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents in november 2015 we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some pointofsale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware we expect we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breacheseven if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our businesswe are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests personal data and other sensitive information we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards in addition states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affectedwe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert managements attention we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders spending cash and incurring debt assuming contingent liabilities or creating additional expenses we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able 20to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu general data protection regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our agreements with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channelsin addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel 21intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers or through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guests charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 104 countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 20 percent and 22 percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including rapid changes in governmental economic and political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operatethe effect of disruptions caused by severe weather natural disasters outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws  the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 22instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from the united kingdoms june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as brexituncertainties as to local laws regarding and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uks bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone or blackstones affiliates or following blackstones proposed sale of our common stock to hna tourism group co ltd hna hna and hnas affiliates other affiliates of blackstone or hna have in the past or may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 23the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies a significant number of our employees approximately 30 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately nine percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage more than 169000 individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to manage and staff the managed owned and leased hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 5700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important 24intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages force us to stop using the intellectual property that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged intellectual property force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other agreements to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property limit our ability to develop new intellectual property andlimit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 25to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at allfollowing the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailableterrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results 26the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 through december 31 2010 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton honors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irss position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them additionally the irs has notified us of its intention to examine the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 through december 31 2013 see note 18 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operationsour total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national 27labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on usthe cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 28casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include location including proximity to or easy access from major population centers appearance local regional or national economic and political conditions the existence or construction of competing casinos dependence on tourism and governmental regulation jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  risks related to our recent spinoffs we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffsalthough we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spinoffs will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoffs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits for example if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met by park the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us our stockholders and stockholders of park in addition the costs we incur in connection with or as a result of the spinoffs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoffs or if our costs exceed our estimates we or the businesses that were spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on our or their business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholderswe received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the 29requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoffif the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares receivedpark or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffsin connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spinoffs we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flowsin connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the futurein connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsif we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial resultspursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business30risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2016 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts was approximately 109 billion including 696 million of timeshare debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and timeshare debt for the years ending december 31 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively were 179 million 110 million and 543 million our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunitiesincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations  certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock pay dividends including to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock make certain investments incur certain liens 31enter into transactions with affiliates merge or consolidate enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and transfer or sell assets in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 70 to 10 as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives finally our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted by the stockholders agreement we entered into with hgv and certain entities affiliated with blackstone that is intended to preserve the taxfree status of the spinoffs of park and hgv despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 32risks related to ownership of our common stock the interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 403 percent of our common stock as of december 31 2016 hna has agreed to acquire 25 percent of our outstanding common stock from blackstone moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders agreement with blackstone for so long as it retains specified levels of ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by blackstone if blackstones proposed sale of our common stock to hna closes hna will have specified board designation rights as described in our current report on form 8k filed on october 24 2016 thus for so long as blackstone and hna continue to own specified percentages of our stock each will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time each of blackstone and hna will have influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers for example for so long as blackstone or hna continues to own a significant percentage of our stock blackstone or hna may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock each of blackstone and hna and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in the hospitality industry in the ordinary course of their business activities each of blackstone and hna and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders for example blackstone owns interests in extended stay america inc la quinta holdings inc park hotels amp resorts inc and hilton grand vacations inc and certain other investments in the hospitality industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us hna acquired carlson hotels in december 2016 and has an interest in nh hotel group in addition affiliates of blackstone and hna directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate under the companys stockholders agreement with hna the company agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to hna or its affiliates blackstone or hna also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition blackstone or hna may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their respective investments even though such transactions might involve risks to you  while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors may cause the market price of our common stock to declinesales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock in addition blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stockpursuant to registration rights agreements blackstone and certain management stockholders have and hna will have the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 412 percent of our outstanding common stock as of 33december 31 2016 these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which blackstone ceases to beneficially own at least 40 percent of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office which would be the case upon closing of the hna transaction these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote andthese provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetingsfurther as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desireitem 1b unresolved staff

experiences and choose to stay where they can expect to never see the same thing twice the first property is expected to open by the third quarter of 2017segments and regionsduring the periods covered by this report management analyzed our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions which consisted of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services ownership management and franchise and timeshare the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the timeshare segment consists of 42multiunit vacation ownership properties and generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare intervals owned by us and third parties resort operations and providing consumer financing for the timeshare interestsgeographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represents a significant portion of our systemwide hotel rooms which was 75 percent as of december 31 2016 therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations refer to part iitem 2 properties for the specific properties and respective locations of the properties that were distributed to park in connection with the spinoffssystem growth and pipelinewe continue to expand our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor as the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the respective hotel that we contract with to provide management or franchise services additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capitalas of december 31 2016 we had a total of 1968 hotels in our development pipeline representing approximately 310000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 96 countries and territories including 32 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels over 99 percent of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment of the rooms in the pipeline over 159000 rooms or more than half of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2016 over 157000 rooms representing approximately half of our development pipeline were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us principal components and factors affecting our results of operationsrevenuesprincipal componentsduring the periods presented in this report we primarily derived our revenues from the following sourcesowned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from hotel operations including room rentals food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions sponsored by associations corporate social military educational religious or other organizations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenuesmanagement and franchise fees and other represents revenues derived from management fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties managed by us franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands and other revenue generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised properties and other rental incometerms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically a percentage of each hotels gross revenue and in some cases an incentive fee which is based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed amount as stated in the management agreement outside of the us our fees are often more dependent on hotel 43profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee additionally we receive onetime upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts as well as a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs in general the hotel owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses costs we incur in operating the hotel under our franchise agreements franchisees pay us franchise fees which consist of initial application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system and monthly royalty fees generally calculated as a percentage of room revenues royalty fees for our full service brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable in addition to the franchise application and royalty fees franchisees also generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the cost of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation system expenses and quality assurance program costs we also earn fees when certain franchise agreements are terminated early or there is a change in ownership timeshare represents revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare intervals and revenues from enrollments and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties which we refer to as resort operations additionally in recent years we began a transformation of our timeshare business to a capital light model in which thirdparty timeshare owners and developers provided capital for development while we acted as the sales and marketing agent and property manager through these transactions we received a sales and marketing commission and branding fees based on the total sales price of the timeshare interval recurring fees to operate the homeowners associations and revenues from resort operations other revenues from managed and franchised properties these revenues represent the payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised properties the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net incomefactors affecting our revenuesthe following factors affected the revenues we derived from our operations during the periods presentedconsumer demand and global economic conditions consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks affecting or reducing travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profit measures our timeshare segment also is linked to cycles in the general economy consumer discretionary spending and availability of financing as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatilityagreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers we depend on our longterm management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise agreements and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees relating to hotels in the pipeline are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and 44development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party additionally we entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers we relied on these relationships to expand our timeshare interval supply without deploying capital for asset construction expensesprincipal componentswe primarily incurred the following expenses during the periods presentedowned and leased hotels reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expense food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products other support expenses consist of costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurancetimeshare includes the cost of inventory sold during the period sales and marketing expenses resort operations expenses and other overhead expenses associated with our timeshare businessdepreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings furniture fixtures and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels and certain corporate assets as well as amortization of our management and franchise intangibles and capitalized softwaregeneral administrative and other expenses consists primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments including divisional offices that support our management and franchise segment professional fees including consulting audit and legal fees travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses for uncollected management franchise and other fees contractual performance obligations and office administrative and related expenses expenses incurred by our supply management business laundry facilities and other ancillary businesses are also included in general administrative and other expenses impairment losses we hold significant amounts of goodwill amortizing and nonamortizing intangible assets and longlived assets we evaluate these assets for impairment as further discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates these evaluations have resulted in impairment losses for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the assets and our estimates of fair value based on economic conditions or other factors at a propertyspecific or companywide level we may be required to take additional impairment losses to reflect further declines in our asset valuesother expenses from managed and franchised properties these expenses represent the payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised properties the corresponding revenues are presented as other revenues from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net incomefactors affecting our costs and expensesthe following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with owning leasing managing and franchising hotels and timeshare resorts are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flow margins 45and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts is limited by the amount of fixed costs inherent in our business as a result we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs or to defer or cancel capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands also a significant portion of our costs to support our timeshare business relates to direct sales and marketing of these units in periods of decreased demand for timeshare intervals we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profit margins on our timeshare businesschanges in depreciation and amortization expense changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets additionally we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expense will increaseother itemseffect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationssignificant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periodsseasonalitythe lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarterskey business and financial metrics used by managementcomparable hotelswe define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4875 hotels in our system as of december 31 2016 3740 have been classified as comparable hotels our 1135 noncomparable hotels included 135 properties or approximately three percent of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 4565 hotels in our system as of december 31 2015 3624 were classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2015 occupancyoccupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases46adradr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described aboverevparwe calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotelsreferences to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis all periods use the same exchange rates unless otherwise notedebitda and adjusted ebitdafor a discussion of our definition of adjusted ebitda see note 23 business segments in our consolidated financial statementsebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with us gaap in addition our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and income tax expense are dependent on company specifics including among other things our capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i sharebased compensation expense as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them ii furniture fixtures and equipment ffampe replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of ffampe for its owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffampe and iii other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performanceebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations areebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needsebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtednessebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxesebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitmentsebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations47although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements andother companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently limiting their usefulness as comparative measuresbecause of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations results of

year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of two corporate structuring transactions that were effected during the three months ended december 31 2016 and included i the organization of hiltons assets and subsidiaries in preparation for the spinoffs and ii a restructuring of hiltons international assets and subsidiaries the international restructuring the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets including intellectual property used in the international business from us subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016 the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated us tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign jurisdictions further our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities our estimated deferred effective tax rate has increased in total these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of 513 million during the three months ended december 31 2016 see note 18 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion the decrease in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily the result of a 640 million deferred tax benefit resulting from transactions involving the conversion of certain us subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies and the election to disregard certain foreign subsidiaries for us federal income tax purposes this benefit was offset by an increase in tax expense resulting from a 349 million increase in our income before income taxes further income tax expense was affected by the reduction in goodwill in connection with the sales of the waldorf astoria new york and the hilton sydney as well as compensation costs

the cancellation date in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract see note 24 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for further discussioncritical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations64management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directorsproperty and equipment and intangible assets with finite liveswe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment lossesas part of the process described above we exercise judgment todetermine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific informationdetermine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group these estimated growth rates are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources anddetermine the asset fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerationswe had 8930 million of property and equipment net and 1526 million of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2016 changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be materialinvestments in affiliateswe evaluate our investments in affiliates for potential impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own or lease hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investments fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationswe had 114 million of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2016 changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses which could be materialgoodwillwe evaluate goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23 business segments in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we 65compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value when determining estimated fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination we had 5822 million of goodwill as of december 31 2016 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material additionally when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained we use estimates and assumptions similar to that of those used in our impairment analysisbrandswe evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losseswe had 4848 million of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2016 changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material hilton honorshilton honors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per staywe had 1432 million of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2016 including 543 million in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability allowance for loan lossesthe allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rateswe had 120 million of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2016 changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance 66income taxeswe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statementswe use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statementslegal contingencieswe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statementsconsolidationswe use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statementssharebased compensationthe process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions refer to note 20 sharebased compensation in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants 67item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes interest rate riskwe are

evaluation of rights held by other ownership interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our

financial statements in conformity with united states of america us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and accordingly ultimate results could differ from those estimatessummary of significant accounting policiesrevenue recognitionrevenues are primarily derived from the following sources and are generally recognized as services are rendered and when collectibility is reasonably assured amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilitiesowned and leased hotel revenues primarily consist of room rentals food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services from owned leased and consolidated nonwholly owned hotel properties revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied or goods and services have been delivered or renderedmanagement fees represent fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties that we manage usually under longterm contracts with the property owner and homeowners associations management fees from hotels usually include a base fee which is generally a percentage of hotel revenues and an incentive fee which is typically based on a fixed or variable percentage of hotel profits and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period we recognize base fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms of the management agreement for incentive fees we recognize those amounts that would be due if the contract was terminated at the financial statement date management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed percent as stated in the management agreement and are recognized as the services are performedfranchise fees represent fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our hotel brands usually under longterm contracts with the hotel owner we charge a monthly franchise royalty fee generally based on a percentage of room revenue as well as application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system royalty fees for our full service brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues where applicable we also earn fees when certain franchise agreements are terminated early or there is a change in ownership application and initiation fees are recognized when all services and conditions have been substantially performed or satisfied by us generally upon execution of the agreement we recognize royalty and other franchise fees as the fees are earned which is when all material services or conditions have been performed or satisfiedother revenues include revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels including purchasing operations and other rental income this includes any revenues received for vendor rebate arrangements we participate in as a manager of hotel and timeshare propertiestimeshare revenues consist of revenues generated from our hilton grand vacations timeshare business timeshare revenues are principally generated from the sale and financing of feesimple timeshare intervals deeded in perpetuity developed or acquired either by us or by third parties revenue from a deeded timeshare sale is recognized when the customer has executed a binding sales contract a minimum 10 percent down payment has been received certain minimum sales thresholds for a timeshare project have been attained the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired and the related receivable is deemed to be collectible we defer revenue recognition for sales that do not meet these criteria during periods of construction revenue from timeshare sales is recognized under the percentageofcompletion method in this case sales revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease additionally we receive sales commissions from certain thirdparty developers that we assist in selling their timeshare inventory we recognize revenue from commissions on these sales as intervals are sold and we fulfill the service requirements under the respective sales agreements with the developers revenue from the financing of timeshare sales is recognized on the accrual method as earned based on the outstanding principal interest rate and terms stated in each individual financing agreement we record an estimate of uncollectible accounts as a reduction of sales revenue at the time revenue is recognized on a timeshare interval sale see the financing receivables section below for further discussion of the policies applicable to our timeshare financing receivables we also generate revenues from club enrollment and other fees rentals of timeshare units food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties that are recognized when units are rented or goods and services are delivered or rendered79other revenues from managed and franchised properties represent payroll and related costs certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income loss or net income loss we are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis we have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent we do not retain these taxes and fees and therefore they are not included in revenues we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agencycash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities when purchased of three months or lessrestricted cash and cash equivalentsrestricted cash and cash equivalents include cash balances established as security for certain guarantees lender reserves ground rent and property tax escrows insurance deposits for assets we plan to acquire and advance deposits received on timeshare sales that are held in escrow until the contract is closedallowance for doubtful accountsan allowance for doubtful accounts is provided on accounts receivable when losses are probable based on historical collection activity and current business conditionsinventoriesinventories include unsold completed timeshare intervals timeshare intervals under construction and land and infrastructure held for future timeshare interval development at our timeshare properties collectively timeshare inventory as well as hotel inventories consisting of operating supplies that have a period of consumption of one year or less guest room items and food and beverage itemstimeshare inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell based on the relative sales value capital expenditures associated with our timeshare intervals are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold consistent with industry practice timeshare inventory is classified as a current asset despite an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months the majority of sales and marketing costs incurred to sell timeshare intervals are expensed when incurred certain direct and incremental selling and marketing costs are deferred on a contract until revenue from the interval sale has been recognizedin accordance with the accounting standards for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects we use the relative sales value method of costing our timeshare sales and relieving inventory in addition we continually assess our timeshare inventory and if necessary impose pricing adjustments to modify sales pace it is possible that any future changes in our development and sales strategies could have a material effect on the carrying value of our timeshare inventory and purchase commitments for timeshare inventory we monitor our projects and inventory on an ongoing basis and complete an evaluation each reporting period to ensure that the inventory and purchase commitments for inventory are at the lower of cost or markethotel inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost using firstin firstout or fifo or net realizable valueproperty and equipmentproperty and equipment are recorded at cost and interest applicable to major construction or development projects is capitalized costs of improvements that extend the economic life or improve service potential are also capitalized capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives costs for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred80depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the assets estimated useful lives which are generally as follows buildings and improvements 8 to 40 years furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years and computer equipment 3 to 5 years leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life based on the estimates above or the lease termwe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment if there are indicators of potential impairment we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the assets carrying value by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses fair value is generally estimated using valuation techniques that consider the discounted cash flows of the asset using discount and capitalization rates deemed reasonable for the type of asset as well as prevailing market conditions appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offersif sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation including environmental remediation liabilities we recognize the fair value of the obligation when the obligation is incurred which is generally upon acquisition construction or development andor through the normal operation of the assetbusiness combinationswe consider a business combination to occur when the company takes control of a business by acquiring its net assets or equity interests we record the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests at fair value as of the acquisition date including any contingent consideration we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected future cash flows discounted at riskadjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate fair value of the assets acquisitionrelated costs such as due diligence legal and accounting fees are expensed in the period incurred and are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assetsfinancing receivableswe define financing receivables as financing arrangements that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates which are recognized as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets we record all financing receivables at amortized cost in current and longterm financing receivables we recognize interest income as earned and provide an allowance for cancellations and defaults we have divided our financing receivables into two portfolio segments based on the level of aggregation at which we develop and document a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for loan losses based on their initial measurement risk characteristics and our method for monitoring and assessing credit risk we have determined the classes of financing receivables to correspond to our identified portfolio segments as followstimeshare financing receivables comprise loans related to our financing of timeshare interval sales and secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we recognize interest income on our timeshare financing receivables as earned the interest rate charged on the notes correlates to the risk profile of the borrower at the time of purchase and the percentage of the purchase that is financed among other factors we monitor the credit quality of our receivables on an ongoing basis we evaluate this portfolio collectively for uncollectibility since we hold a large group of homogeneous timeshare financing receivables which are individually immaterial there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance for loan loss is determined by management through analysis of several factors such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates aging and historical writeoffs of these receivables the allowance for loan loss is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on a periodic analysis of the mortgage portfolio once a note is 90 days past due or is determined to be uncollectible prior to 90 days past due we cease accruing interest and reverse the accrued interest recognized up to that point we apply payments we receive for loans including those in nonaccrual status to amounts due in the following order servicing fees late charges interest and principal we resume interest accrual for loans for which we had previously ceased accruing interest once the loan is less than 90 days past due we fully reserve for a timeshare financing receivable in the month following the date that the loan is 120 days past due and subsequently we write off the uncollectible note against the reserve once the foreclosure process is complete and we receive the deed for the foreclosed unit81other financing receivables primarily comprise individual loans and other types of unsecured financing arrangements provided to hotel owners we individually assess all financing receivables in this portfolio for collectibility and impairment we measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate for impaired loans we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows we do not recognize interest income on unsecured financing to hotel owners for notes that are greater than 90 days past due and only resume interest recognition if the financing receivable becomes current we fully reserve unsecured financing to hotel owners when we determine that the receivables are uncollectible and when all commercially reasonable means of recovering the receivable balances have been exhaustedinvestments in affiliateswe hold investments in affiliates that primarily own or lease hotels under one of our distinct hotel brands if we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity we account for the investment using the equity or cost method we account for investments using the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity typically through a more than minimal investment investments in affiliates where we own less than a minimal investment and are not able to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost methodour proportionate share of earnings losses from our equity method investments is presented as equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations distributions from investments in unconsolidated entities are presented as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return on investment distributions from unconsolidated affiliates are recorded as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows when such distributions are a return of investmentwe assess the recoverability of our equity method and cost method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if an investment may have an otherthantemporary impairment we assess the fair value of the investment based on accepted valuation methodologies which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investments fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operationsin connection with the october 24 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of blackstone the merger we recorded our equity method investments at their estimated fair value which resulted in an increase to our historical basis in those entities primarily as a result of an increase in the fair value of the real estate assets of the investee entities the basis difference is being amortized as a component of equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates over a period of approximately 40 yearsgoodwillgoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized we do not amortize goodwill but rather evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying amountas part of the merger we recorded goodwill representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the other identified assets and liabilities we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23 business segments we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units the valuation is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary however if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds 82the implied fair value of that goodwill the excess is recognized within impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operationsbrandswe own operate and franchise hotels under our portfolio of brands there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of these brands and accordingly the useful lives of these brands are considered to be indefinite our hotel brand portfolio includes hilton hotels amp resorts waldorf astoria hotels amp resorts conrad hotels amp resorts canopy by hilton curio  a collection by hilton doubletree by hilton embassy suites by hilton hilton garden inn hampton by hilton tru by hilton homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton in addition we also develop and operate timeshare properties under our hilton grand vacations brandat the time of the merger our brands were assigned a fair value based on a common valuation technique known as the relief from royalty approach canopy by hilton curio  a collection by hilton tru by hilton and home2 suites by hilton were launched postmerger and as such they were not assigned fair values we evaluate our brands for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process if a brands estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment lossesintangible assets with finite useful liveswe have certain finite lived intangible assets that were initially recorded at their fair value at the time of the merger these intangible assets consist of management agreements franchise contracts leases certain proprietary technologies and our guest loyalty program hilton honors additionally we capitalize direct and incremental management and franchise contract acquisition costs as finitelived intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their respective estimated useful liveswe capitalize costs incurred to develop internaluse computer software and costs to acquire software licenses internal and external costs incurred in connection with development of upgrades or enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized these capitalized costs are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these capitalized costs are recorded in other intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheetswe review all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the fair value in our consolidated statements of operationshilton honorshilton honors is a guest loyalty program provided to hotels and timeshare properties nearly all of our owned leased managed and franchised hotels and timeshare properties participate in the hilton honors program hilton honors members earn points based on their spending at our participating hotels and timeshare properties and through participation in affiliated partner programs when points are earned by hilton honors members the property or affiliated partner pays hilton honors based on an estimated cost per point for the costs of operating the program which include marketing promotion communication administration and the estimated cost of award redemptions hilton honors member points are accumulated and may be redeemed for the right to stay at participating properties as well as for other goods and services from third parties including but not limited to airlines car rentals cruises vacation packages shopping and dining we provide hilton honors as a marketing program to participating hotels and timeshare properties with the objective of operating the program on a breakeven basis to ushilton honors records a liability related to revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that include historical experience an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of reimbursing hotels and other third parties in respect to other redemption opportunities available to members revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts only when points that have been redeemed for hotel stay certificates are used by members or their designees at the respective properties additionally when 83members of the hilton honors loyalty program redeem award certificates at our owned and leased hotels we recognize room revenue included in owned and leased hotels revenues in our consolidated statements of operationsfair value measurements  valuation hierarchyfair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date an exit price we use the threelevel valuation hierarchy for classification of fair value measurements the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the data market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized belowlevel 1  valuation is based upon quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the instrumentlevel 3  valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurementthe classification of assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety proper classification of fair value measurements within the valuation hierarchy is considered each reporting period the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amountsderivative instrumentswe use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we regularly monitor the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to our derivative instruments under the terms of certain loan agreements we are required to maintain derivative financial instruments to manage interest rates we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we record all derivatives at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered we may designate the derivative as one of the following a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid cash flow hedge a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of our foreign currency exposure net investment hedge changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other

attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings if we do not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings likewise the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current period earnings cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flowsif we determine that we qualify for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument at the designation date we formally document all relationships between hedging activities including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and determining the foreign currency exposure of the net investment of the foreign operation for a net investment hedgeon a quarterly basis we assess the effectiveness of our designated hedges in offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using the hypothetical derivative method this method compares the cumulative change in fair value of each hedging instrument to the cumulative change in fair value of a hypothetical hedging instrument 84which has terms that identically match the critical terms of the respective hedged transactions thus the hypothetical hedging instrument is presumed to perfectly offset the hedged cash flows ineffectiveness results when the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical hedging instrument we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge

performance conditions are not considered probable until they occur no compensation expense for these awards is recognizedincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year to recognize the deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate to tax consequences in future years which result from differences between the respective tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the respective temporary differences or operating loss or tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the realization of deferred tax assets and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income and other restrictions that may exist under the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which a deferred tax asset exists valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realizedwe use a prescribed recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return for all income tax positions we first determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if it is determined that a position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlementrecently issued accounting pronouncementsadopted accounting standardsin august 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201615 asu 201615 statement of cash flows topic 230  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments this asu addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230  restricted cash this asu requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the provisions of both asus are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and are to be applied retrospectively early adoption is permitted we elected as permitted by the standards to early adopt asu 201615 and asu 201618 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we restated all prior periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the adoption of asu 201615 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements the effect of the adoption of asu 201618 on our consolidated statements of cash flows was to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances in the beginning and end of period balances of cash restricted cash and cash equivalents the change in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents was previously disclosed in operating activities investing activities and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in april 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs this asu requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt 86liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset which is consistent with the presentation of debt discounts and premiums in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201515 asu 201515 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530  presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements which clarifies that absent authoritative guidance in asu 201503 for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements the staff of the sec would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement we adopted asu 201503 and asu 201515 retrospectively as of january 1 2016 as a result approximately 94 million of debt issuance costs that were previously presented in other noncurrent assets as of december 31 2015 are now included within longterm debt and timeshare debt we elected to continue presenting the debt issuance costs related to our lineofcredit arrangements within other noncurrent assetsin february 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 asu 201502 consolidation topic 810  amendments to the consolidation analysis this asu modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities all legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model we elected as permitted by the standard to adopt asu 201502 as of january 1 2016 using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of january 1 2016 of approximately 5 million additionally certain consolidated entities that were not previously considered vies prior to the adoption of asu 201502 were considered to be vies for which we are the primary beneficiary and continue to be consolidated following adoption prior period vie disclosures do not include the balances or activity associated with these viesaccounting standards not yet adoptedin february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 asu 201602 leases topic 842 which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in leases topic 840 and generally requires all leases including operating leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position as rightofuse assets and lease liabilities by lessees the provisions of asu 201602 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect that this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements but we expect this asu to have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheetin may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 this asu supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in revenue recognition topic 605 and requires entities to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services subsequent to asu 201409 the fasb has issued several related asus the provisions of asu 201409 and the related asus will be effective for us beginning january 1 2018 and adoption as of the original effective date of january 1 2017 is permitted we will not early adopt the new standard this asu permits two transition approaches retrospective or modified retrospective we are still evaluating our transition approach and expect to reach a decision in early 2017 we anticipate that asu 201409 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements however we expect revenue recognition related to our accounting for ongoing royalty and management fee revenues and direct reimbursable fees from our management and franchise agreements and hotel guest transactions at our owned and leased hotels to remain substantially unchanged while we are continuing to assess all other potential effects of the standard we currently believe the provisions of asu 201409 will affect revenue recognition as follows i application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system will be recognized over the term of the franchise agreement ii certain contract acquisition costs related to our management and franchise agreements will be recognized over the term of the agreements as a reduction to revenue and iii incentive management fees will be recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur as a result of future hotel profits or cash flows we do not expect the changes in revenue recognition for certain contract acquisition costs or incentive management fees to affect the companys net income for any full year period we are currently assessing the effect of the standard on indirect reimbursable fees related to our management and franchise agreements and the accounting for our guest loyalty program we continue to update our assessment of the effect that asu 201409 and related asus will have on our consolidated financial statements and we will disclose further material effects if any when known87note 3 acquisitions tax deferred exchangeduring the year ended december 31 2015 we used proceeds from the sale of the waldorf astoria new york to acquire as part of a tax

subsidiaries in preparation for the spinoffs and ii a restructuring of hiltons international assets and subsidiaries the international restructuring the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets including intellectual property used in the international business from us subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016 the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated us tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign jurisdictions further our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities our estimated deferred effective tax rate has increased in total these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of 513 million during the three months ended december 31 2016after the 2016 international restructuring based on our consideration of all available positive and negative evidence we determined that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize the benefit of various foreign deferred tax assets accordingly as of december 31 2016 we released valuation allowances of 32 million against our foreign deferred tax assetsduring the year ended december 31 2015 certain of our us subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies and certain of our subsidiary controlled foreign corporations elected to be disregarded for us federal income tax purposes these transactions were treated as taxfree liquidations for federal tax purposes as a result of these liquidation transactions 512 million of deferred tax liabilities were derecognized in addition we recognized 128 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets associated with assets and liabilities distributed from the liquidated controlled foreign 102corporations resulting in a total deferred tax benefit of 640 million these previously unrecognized deferred tax assets were a component of our investment in foreign subsidiaries deferred tax balances that were connected to the liquidated controlled foreign corporations prior to these liquidations we did not believe that the benefit of these deferred tax assets would be realized within the foreseeable future therefore we did not recognize these deferred tax assets deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities plus carryforward items the tax effects of the temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to our net deferred tax asset liability were as follows  december 31 2016 2015 in millionsdeferred tax assets   net operating loss

16 billion respectively which resulted in deferred tax assets of 10 million for state jurisdictions and 400 million for foreign jurisdictions approximately 17 million of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2016 related to net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between 2017 and 2036 with less than 1 million of that amount expiring in 2017 approximately 393 million of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2016 resulted from net operating loss carryforwards that are not subject to expiration we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this assessment we provided a valuation allowance of 385 million as of december 31 2016 on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards our total valuation allowance relating to these net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets increased 16 million

identified resolved and settled as part of our ongoing us federal audit we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had accrued approximately 31 million and 27 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties we accrued approximately 4 million 5 million and 8 million during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 217 million and 377 million respectively associated with positions that if favorably resolved would provide a benefit to our effective tax rate as a result of the expected resolution of examination issues with federal state and foreign tax authorities we believe it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease up to 8 millionwe file income tax returns including returns for our subsidiaries with federal state and foreign jurisdictions we are under regular and recurring audit by the internal revenue service irs on open tax positions the timing of the resolution of tax audits is highly uncertain as are the amounts if any that may ultimately be paid upon such resolution changes may result from the conclusion of ongoing audits appeals or litigation in state local federal and foreign tax jurisdictions or from the resolution of various proceedings between the us and foreign tax authorities we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examination for years through 2004 as of december 31 2016 we remain subject to federal examinations from 20052015 state examinations from 20032015 and foreign examinations of our income tax returns for the years 1996 through 2015 in april 2014 we received 30day letters from the irs and the revenue agents report rar for the 2006 and october 2007 tax years we disagreed with several of the proposed adjustments in the rar filed a formal appeals protest with the irs and did not make any tax payments related to this audit the issues being protested in appeals relate to assertions by the irs that 1 certain foreign currencydenominated intercompany loans from our foreign subsidiaries to certain us subsidiaries should be recharacterized as equity for us federal income tax purposes and constitute deemed dividends from such foreign subsidiaries to our us subsidiaries 2 in calculating the amount of us taxable income resulting from our hilton honors guest loyalty program we should not reduce gross income by the estimated costs of future redemptions but rather such costs would be deductible at the time the points are redeemed and 3 certain foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our luxembourg subsidiaries whose functional currency is usd should instead be treated as issued by one of our belgian subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and thus foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such loans should have been measured in euros instead of usd additionally in january 2016 we received a 30day letter from the irs and the rar for the december 2007 through 2010 tax years the rar includes the proposed adjustments for tax years december 2007 through 2010 which reflect the carryover effect of the three protested issues from 2006 through october 2007 these proposed adjustments will also be protested in appeals and formal appeals protests have been submitted in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in additional us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes the portion of this amount related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program would result in a decrease to our future tax liability when the points are redeemed we disagree with the irss position on each of these assertions and intend to vigorously contest them however as a result of recent developments related to the appeals process discussion that have taken place in 2016 we have determined based on ongoing discussions with the irs it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the full benefit related to certain of the issues being appealed accordingly as of december 31 2016 we have recorded a 44 million unrecognized tax benefit state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing the respective return however the state effect of any federal tax return changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period generally of up to one year after formal notification to the states the statute of limitations for the foreign jurisdictions generally ranges from three to ten years after filing the respective tax returnnote 19 employee benefit plans we sponsor multiple domestic and international employee benefit plans benefits are based upon years of service and compensationwe have a noncontributory retirement plan in the us the domestic plan which covers certain employees not earning union benefits this plan was frozen for participant benefit accruals in 1996 therefore the projected benefit obligation is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation the plan assets will be used to pay benefits due to employees for service through december 31 1996 as employees have not accrued additional benefits since that time we do not utilize salary or pension inflation assumptions in calculating our benefit obligation for the domestic plan the annual measurement date for the domestic plan is december 31we also have multiple employee benefit plans that cover many of our international employees these include i a plan that covers workers in the united kingdom the uk plan which was frozen to further service accruals on november 30 2013 104and ii a number of smaller plans that cover workers in various countries around the world the international plans the annual measurement date for all of these plans is december 31we are required to recognize the funded status of our pension plans which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations in our consolidated balance sheets and make corresponding adjustments for changes in the value through accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax the following table presents the projected benefit obligation the fair value
