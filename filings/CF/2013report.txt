phosphate fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 13 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2012 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america   bartow phosphate complex   we own a site in bartow florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex this complex ceased production in 1999 and the former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements   phosphate

reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area   sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p2o5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2012 martin sulphur our largest molten sulfur supplier supplied approximately 61 of the molten sulfur used at plant city   ammonia supply dap and map have a nitrogen content of 18 and 11 respectively and a phosphate nutrient content of 46 and 52 respectively ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in dap and map operating at capacity our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately 400000 tons of ammonia annually   the ammonia used at our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia storage facility located in tampa florida this facility consists of a 38000ton ammonia storage tank access to a deepwater dock that is capable of discharging oceangoing vessels and rail and truck loading facilities in addition to supplying our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex our tampa ammonia distribution system has the capacity to support ammonia sales to and distribution services for other customers sales of ammonia from our tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment the ammonia supply for tampa is purchased from offshore sources providing us with access to the broad international ammonia market   phosphate distribution   we operate a phosphate fertilizer warehouse located at a deepwater port facility in tampa florida most of the phosphate fertilizer produced at plant city is shipped by truck or rail to our tampa warehouse where it is loaded onto vessels for shipment to export customers or for transport across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river in 2012 our tampa warehouse handled approximately 13 million tons of phosphate fertilizers or about 67 of our production the remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or rail directly to customers or to inmarket storage facilities   phosphate fertilizer shipped across the gulf of mexico to the mississippi river is transferred into river barges near new orleans phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is transported to our storage facilities or delivered directly to customers river transportation is provided primarily under an

independent fertilizer distributors chs inc was our largest customer in 2012 and accounted for ten percent of our consolidated net sales sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force   competition   our markets are intensely competitive based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers   in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium and koch nitrogen there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition from foreignsourced products continuously   in our phosphate segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium mosaic potash corp and simplot the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer andor trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   seasonality   the sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant  11      table of

environmental health and safety expenditures   our environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2012 totaled approximately 452 million in 2013 we estimate that we will spend approximately 613 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures the increase in expenditures in 2013 is primarily related to certain projects to reduce emissions from our facilities including projects to improve the integrity and capacity of storage tanks at certain plant locations environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations such

with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court the court on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013   in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed  13      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court   on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation   moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation   the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule   depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash

state regional and federal levels the epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program beginning in january 2011 and the regulation could significantly decrease the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations in the future on december 20 2012 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected a request to reconsider its decision to uphold the ghg regulations regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such

source performance standards for nitric acid plants   we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing

operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals   as of december 31 2012 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our  15      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  requirements at current production rates for approximately 12 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee

for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a

closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012   changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of high natural gas prices if this were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   over the last several years north american natural gas prices have declined in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted   historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade   periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity   during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production  18      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers   we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities   some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships   china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese policy encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate almost all urea imports from russia and ukraine are currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose duties of approximately 65 percent on urea imported into the united states from these two countries russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are among the worlds largest urea exporters in russia the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government on a nonmarket basis russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these governmentcontrolled natural gas prices encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports in ukraine we believe that the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been very little urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time the us department of commerce regularly reviews the us sales of urea made by russian exporters in october 2011 the us department of commerce completed a review of us sales made by the russian exporter eurochem and concluded that duties of approximately one percent should be imposed this low rate of duty resulted in a marked increase in exports of russian urea to the united states in october 2012 the commerce department completed another review of eurochems sales and reduced to zero the duty applied to eurochems us urea imports this may result in more russian urea exports to the united states   in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission conducted the third sunset review of the urea antidumping orders and determined that they should remain in effect for another five years the next sunset review of those orders will not be initiated until late 2016   russia is the worlds largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter as in the case of urea russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia is subject to an antidumping duty order which currently imposes antidumping duties of almost 254 percent on russian ammonium nitrate imports into the united states in may 2011 this order replaced a longstanding suspension agreement which had imposed volume and pricing restrictions on russian ammonium nitrate imports in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission completed the second sunset review of the  19      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  russian ammonium nitrate antidumping order and concluded that it will remain in effect for at least another five years russian producers of ammonium nitrate are likely to participate in legal processes through which they may reduce the applicable antidumping duty rate applicable to their us imports and if they are successful there may be an increase in us imports of unfairly priced russian ammonium nitrate further one russian producer is currently seeking permission to import an ammonium nitrate product outside the reach of the antidumping order if successful this effort would likely result in a significant increase in us imports of this russian ammonium nitrate product   fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from ukraine is also subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156 percent that order is currently being reviewed and a decision as to whether the order will remain in place for an additional five years is expected to be issued by may 2013 if the order is revoked we are likely to experience a significant increase in us imports of unfairly priced ukrainian ammonium nitrate   a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products   conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control   state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in recent years for example ethanol production in the united states has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment   our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations   we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards  20      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products   if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board or stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials including the recovery of the cost to implement the mandatory anticollision train control system referred to as positive train control iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials and iv limit the liability or railroads in canada when transporting tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products   difficulties in the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results   since the terra acquisition cf industries continued to utilize legacy terras separate

information systems could have severe financial and other business implications   adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations   weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products   adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns   weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise   we may not be able to complete our recently announced capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget

louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties   the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms although we have entered into contracts with an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde for engineering and procurement services for each of the projects and we have procured bids from several construction firms we have not yet entered into definitive agreements for construction services for either project if thyssenkrupp uhde or any of the other third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected   we must also obtain numerous regulatory approvals and permits in order to construct and operate the additional plants these requirements may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all our financial exposure to permitting risks may be exacerbated because we have committed to purchase certain equipment that will result in substantial expenditures prior to obtaining all permits necessary to operate the units in the event that we ultimately fail to obtain all necessary permits we would be forced to abandon the projects and lose the benefit of any construction costs already incurred in addition federal and

and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013   in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court   on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation   moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation   the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule  24      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent

condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex   florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as of december 31 2012 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 12 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at  25      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our phase ii expansion that is currently being constructed this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us   our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality   the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season   if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly  26      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results   a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets   under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2012 and 2011 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 17 and 21 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments   we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment   we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2012 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 23 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses   we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues   in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward  27      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist   our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity   in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements   our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our

are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage   we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities   our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which

and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our

replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that such illicit use of our products

and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other

cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 23 billion as of december 31 2012 we generally invest these cash and cashequivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by

effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among  30      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted   in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment   we have a material amount of indebtedness

total indebtedness consisting primarily of 800 million of our senior notes due in 2018 and 800 million of our senior notes due in 2020 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 4910 million the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have negative consequences on our business should operating cash flows be insufficient to cover debt service which would adversely affect our operations and liquidity   from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of

purchase agreements of cf industries and viterra with cfl the amendments modified the selling prices that cfl charges for products sold to cf industries and viterra the modified selling prices are based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and are effective retroactively to january 1 2012 as a result of the january 1 2012 effective date of the amendment we recognized in our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated statement of operations a reduction in net sales revenue from viterra of 1297 million and a corresponding reduction in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest to reverse the interim market price accruals recognized in the first three quarters of 2012 these items had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders but they did reduce each of our consolidated net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest by 1297 million in the fourth quarter the selling price modification also had no impact on our net cash flows as the selling price modification was entirely offset by a change in distributions payable to the noncontrolling interest   the cfl selling price modification effective retroactively to january 1 2012 affected the comparability between the 2012 and 2011 results for certain line items in our financial statements to provide comparable information for those periods we have included in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain financial information on an as

terra industries inc terra acquisition   in april 2010 we completed the acquisition and merger of terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion terras financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of april 5 2010 therefore terras financial results are not included in the consolidated financial results for the first quarter of 2010 further information regarding the acquisition of terra including the related issuance of longterm debt and the public offering of common shares of cf holdings can be found in notes 12 and 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report and in the section titled acquisition of terra later in this discussion and analysis   financial executive summary    we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 18 billion in 2012 compared to net earnings of 15 billion in 2011 our 2012 results included a 746 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket gain 462 million after tax on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the termination of our former senior secured credit agreement the 2010 credit agreement which was replaced by a new unsecured credit agreement dated may 1 2012 the 2012 credit agreement and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2859 in 2012 from 2198 in 2011 due to higher net earnings and lower average number of outstanding common shares due to our share repurchase program  net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion in 2011 included a 773 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket loss 480 million after tax on natural gas derivatives a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our former woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 199 million 123 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011 44 million 27 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra and a 20 million 13 million after tax gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business  our gross margin increased 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 due primarily to an increase in the nitrogen segment partially offset by a decline in the phosphate segment the increase in gross margin is impacted by the modification of the cfl selling prices described above on an as adjusted basis the gross margin increase was 13   in the nitrogen segment gross margin increased by 3504 million or 14 driven by higher average selling prices unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to unrealized losses in the prior year and lower realized natural gas costs on an as adjusted basis the gross margin of the nitrogen segment increased 20 the favorable nitrogen segment results were partially offset by a 1327 million or 40 decrease in the phosphate segment gross margin driven primarily by lower average selling prices    our net sales were approximately 61 billion in both 2012 and 2011 slightly higher nitrogen segment sales were essentially offset by lower phosphate segment sales in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 2 as higher average selling prices for ammonia and urea and higher   42      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc    ammonia sales volume were partially offset by lower average uan selling prices and sales volume the comparability of nitrogen segment net sales is impacted by the 2012 modification of cfl selling prices on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 in the phosphate segment net sales declined by 7 as higher sales volume was more than offset by a 12 decline in average selling prices    cash flow from operations was 24 billion in 2012 the 2967 million or 14 increase compared to 2011 was due mainly to additional cash generated by higher net earnings and an increase in customer advances  we paid cash dividends of 1027 million and 687 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase is due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 040 per common share from 010 per common share which started in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by a reduction in the number of outstanding shares  on august 2 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with glencore international plc glencore to acquire the interests in cfl currently owned by viterra for total cash consideration of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them when the transactions are completed we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and urea production the completion of the transactions is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive purchase agreements cfls results are currently included in our financial statements as a consolidated variable interest entity   on november 1 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea plants at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects these projects will increase our production capacity increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our costadvantaged port neal location and allow us to benefit from the global cost advantage of north american natural gas all of the new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings    significant items  2012   robust demand in 2012 for nitrogen fertilizer products was due to favorable application conditions in both the spring and the fall near record corn acreage planted in 2012 and expectations of a similar level of acreage to be planted in 2013 high actual and expected planting levels were driven by record crop prices that resulted in record farm income these market conditions led to higher average selling prices in the nitrogen segment in 2012 that combined with lower natural gas costs resulted in record profitability average selling prices in our phosphate segment were down due to lower demand from india and additional production capacity notably from saudi arabia consolidated net sales of 61 billion in 2012 approximated the same level realized in 2011 as increases in the nitrogen segment due primarily to the higher average selling prices were offset by decreases in the phosphate segment due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2012 average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased by 2 but average phosphate fertilizer selling prices decreased by 12 gross margin increased by 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 nitrogen segment sales to viterra were made on a costplus basis in 2012 in contrast to the marketprice basis that applied in  43      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  2011 and prior years a difference that impacts the comparability of net sales and certain other items between 2012 and prior periods and is discussed above under the heading items affecting comparability of resultscfl selling price modification the 2012 results include 746 million 462 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million pretax charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred fees on the 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  2011   in 2011 average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments affecting certain foreign fertilizer producers and an expected high level of planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season higher average selling prices and sales volumes due to increased demand led to robust operating results in 2011 consolidated net sales in 2011 increased by 21 billion or 54 to 61 billion with increases due primarily to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and higher sales volume due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition in 2011 average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively gross margin increased by 17 billion or 146 to 29 billion in 2011 from 12 billion in 2010 the 2011 results include a 773 million 480 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives results in 2011 also include 1455 million of net interest expense 902 million after tax a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant and a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses  2010   in april 2010 we completed the 46 billion acquisition of terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings this acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence the financial results of the terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date consolidated net sales in 2010 were 40 billion up 52 as compared to 26 billion in 2009 due to the impact of the terra acquisition optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics while average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices declined by 11 in 2010 average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28 gross margin increased by 3401 million or 41 in 2010 to 11795 million the 2010 results include a 96 million 59 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives results in 2010 also include 2198 million of net interest expense 1361 million after tax 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination expenses and peru project costs a 283

of terra  44                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    key industry factors   we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below   global supply amp demand   historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade   natural gas prices   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined over the last three years during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 39 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2012 down from 45 in 2011 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization   farmers economics   the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted   global trade in fertilizer   in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of  45      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world   imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east the ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america   the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   political and social government policies   the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives   factors affecting our results   net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales   cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives  46      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well

impacted by lower average cfl selling prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the cfl selling price modification on an as adjusted basis net sales increased 2   in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 845 million or 2 due primarily to higher nitrogen fertilizer average selling prices which were partially offset by lower sales volume average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizer increased due primarily to positive market conditions as favorable weather created a longer application window tight world market conditions existed for ammonia and urea due to lower international ammonia production and tight domestic supply conditions existed due to increased demand caused by the high level of planted acres and low downstream inventories the 2 increase in nitrogen segment net

inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnaround and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in product mix favoring higher margin nitrogen products during the year   cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 the 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural

selling prices increased to 385 per ton in 2011 from 278 per ton in 2010 with increases across all products strong demand for the spring application season due to an increase in planted acres depleted supplies available at both the producer and customer level due to strong demand global supply constraints and expectations that 2012 planted acres will remain at historically high levels resulted in higher average selling prices nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2011 increased 15 million tons from 2010 due primarily to higher uan and an sales volumes partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume uan sales volume increased significantly during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and the increased supply available from the woodward oklahoma uan plant expansion the increased uan production capacity allowed us to meet increased demand for uan resulting from favorable spring application conditions and customers replenishing depleted downstream inventories after the strong spring application season the increase in an sales in 2011 from the prior year is due to the inclusion of a full year of an sales in 2011 as the production capacity for this product was obtained in the terra acquisition the 2011 decrease in ammonia sales is due primarily to the additional ammonia required to support the production from the uan plant expansion at woodward   cost

operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight and storage costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business   during 2012 we announced the following events that have or will have an impact on our cash and liquidity position    in june 2012 we completed the remaining portion of the 15 billion share repurchase program announced in august 2011  in august 2012 our board of directors authorized an additional 3 billion share repurchase program   in august 2012 we announced our agreement to acquire the 34 interest in cfl that is held by viterra inc for c09 billion subject to regulatory approval and certain closing conditions and  in november 2012 our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion to construct new ammonia urea and uan plants at two of our existing manufacturing complexes in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa    further details regarding these announcements are provided below   cash and cash equivalents   we had cash and cash equivalents of 23 billion and 12 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities   share repurchase programs   in the third quarter of 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 15 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2013 during 2011 we repurchased 65 million shares under the program for 10 billion and in the second quarter of 2012 we repurchased 31 million shares of cf holdings common stock for 5000 million thereby completing this program in june 2012 all 96 million shares that had been repurchased under this program were  61

any repurchases will be determined by our management based on evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors there were no repurchases under this program in 2012   major capital expansion projects   in november 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for these projects in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable pricing advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2012 we incurred capital expenditures of 1208 million on these projects contributing to the increase in capital expenditures in 2012 over those in 2011   we have retained engineering and procurement services from thyssenkrupp uhde uhde through their affiliate uhde corporation of america for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa expansion projects under the terms of the uhde contract we are required to establish a separate cash account and grant a security interest in the account to uhde we are required to maintain in this account a cash balance equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel these projects the amount of cash in the account will change over time based on procurement costs and is projected to reach approximately 500 million at certain points in time during the life of the projects at december 31 2012 there was no cash held in this account cash placed in this account in the future will be considered restricted cash since a security interest in the account has been granted to uhde this restricted cash will not be included in our cash and cash equivalents and will be reported separately on our consolidated balance sheet   capital spending   capital expenditures totaled 5235 million in 2012 as compared to 2472 million in 2011 and 2581 million in 2010 the increase in 2012 capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 1208 million capital expenditures for the two major capital expansion projects discussed above plus certain capital improvement projects at our production facilities capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements  62      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   projected capital spending   we expect to spend between 14 billion and 17 billion on capital projects during 2013 of which 10 billion to 13 billion relates to the major capital expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa discussed above planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in the cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties   acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in canadian fertilizers limited   in august 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire the 34 of cfls common and preferred shares owned by viterra and the product purchase agreement between viterra and cfl for a total purchase price of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding cfl in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them as a result of these transactions we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and granular urea production the completion of these transactions is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive agreements   repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes   we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis   at december 31 2012 approximately 8860 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 23 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries it is expected that a significant portion of this cash balance will be used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl noted above if the transaction is completed the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states at december 31 2012 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 45 million depending upon how we implement the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl some or all of the canadian cash balances may be repatriated to the us resulting in the payment of the applicable portion of the foreign taxes on the repatriation   debt   at both december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 16 billion of senior notes outstanding in two series of 800 million each the first series carries an interest rate of 6875 and is due in the aggregate in 2018 the second series carries an interest rate of 7125 and is due in the aggregate in 2020 at  63      table of

was available for borrowing under our credit agreement net of 90 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings our 2012 credit agreement includes representations warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants and events of default our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2012 credit agreement and the senior notes indentures   forward sales and customer advances   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had approximately 3807 million and 2572 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets   while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2012 and 2011 the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals the level of forward orders may reflect our customers views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply   under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales we may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our  64      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity   derivative financial instruments   we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements   the master netting arrangements to some of our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to those derivative instruments where we hold liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support   as of december 31 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 09 million we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of december 31 2012   financial assurance requirements   in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance requirements related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and our former bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex there are two sources of these financial assurance requirements first in 2010 we entered into a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa and the florida department of environmental protection fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city florida complex the plant city consent decree second the state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we have established a trust account for the benefit of the epa and fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheet these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds in october 2012 we deposited 530 million into the trust for the plant city consent decree thereby reaching full funding of that obligation and we expect to fund the remaining approximately 40 million of the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding will be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts at december 31 2012 and 2011 the balance in the aro funds was 2008 million and 1454 million respectively  65                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems   florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods   acquisition of terra   in april of 2010 we completed the acquisition and merger of terra as a result of the merger each outstanding share of terra common stock was converted into the right to receive 3715 in cash and 00953 of a share of cf holdings common stock cf holdings issued an aggregate of 95 million shares of its common stock with a

compared to year ended december 31 2011   net cash generated from operating activities in 2012 was 24 billion as compared to 21 billion in 2011 the 2967 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net earnings from the nitrogen segment and a lower level of working capital invested in the business at the end of 2012 as compared to the end of 2011 as lower inventory lower receivables and  66      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  higher customer advances and accounts payable and accrued expenses contributed to the lower levels of

plant and equipment and 379 million in sales and maturities of short term securities the proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in 2011 primarily related to the sale of four dry product warehouses and a noncore transportation business the 31 billion in cash used in investing activities in 2010 was due primarily to the net cash consideration of 32 billion for the acquisition of terra partially offset by 2096 million of cash provided by net sales of shortterm investments and redemptions of auction rate securities and proceeds of 1671 million from the sale of terra common stock prior to the acquisition of terra additions to property plant and equipment accounted for 5235 million 2472 million and 2581 million of cash used in investing activities in 2012 2011 and 2010

opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our

  revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales  70                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews   scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment   inventory valuation   we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales   asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities   aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations at active facilities related to closure reclamation  71      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life in the case of reclamation the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs which in some cases may be after initial recognition of the liability the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1450 million as of december 31 2012 and 1316 million as of december 31 2011 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and the recognition of new obligations partially offset by cash expenditures on aros and reductions in previous estimates   environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 59 million as of december 31 2012 and 67 million as of december 31 2011   the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2012 dollars is 510 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2012 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion   recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are  72      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review   the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately   we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2012 or 2011 reviews as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying value of our goodwill resulting mainly from the terra acquisition was 21 billion   fair value measurements   we have classified our investments in auction rate securities included in other assets as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements   derivative financial instruments   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur  73      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our capital expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting   income taxes   we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in

assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 8324 million at december 31 2012 which was 1125 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2012 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 40 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 575 million higher or 518 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed   the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2012 was 46 if the discount rate used to compute 2012 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 38 million higher or 29 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 57 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2012 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2012 would have been 30 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans   consolidation   we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns   we use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status   we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions  75                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    recent accounting pronouncements   see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements   discussion of seasonality impacts on operations   our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns       item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates   commodity prices   our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea and uan 32 by approximately 33 22 and 14 respectively   natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivative instruments that we use currently are natural gas swaps and options these derivatives settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods   at december 31 2012 we had open derivative contracts for 589 million mmbtus of natural gas consisting primarily of options a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2012 would favorably change the fair value of these derivative positions by 280 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would unfavorably change their fair value by 103 million at december 31 2011 we had open derivative contracts for 1563 million mmbtus of natural gas consisting primarily of swaps   we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a short ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 210 per ton and 380 per ton respectively we  76      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  also may from time to time purchase ammonia granular urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities   interest rate fluctuations   as of september 30 2012 we had two series of senior notes each with 8000 million outstanding and original maturity dates of may 1 2018 and may 1 2020 the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding at december 31 2012 was approximately 20 billion borrowings under our 2012 credit agreement bear a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings however in 2012 there were no borrowings under that agreement   foreign currency exchange rates   in the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the euro denominated construction costs associated with our recently announced capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities at december 31 2012 the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately 8840 million and the fair value was 153 million a 10 change in usdeuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 884 million   we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies and prior to the fourth quarter of 2012 we did not utilize any foreign currency derivatives  77                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc        item 8 financial

in the partnership are included in noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements this noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling unitholders interest in the partners capital of tnclp   revenue recognition   the basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are 1 evidence that a sales arrangement exists 2 delivery of goods has occurred 3 the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured we recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales when title transfers to the customer regardless of when the customer advances are received   we offer certain incentives that typically involve rebates if a customer reaches a specified level of purchases incentives are accrued monthly and reported as a reduction in net sales this process is intended to report sales at the ultimate net realized price and requires the use of estimates  85      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of sales fees billed to third parties for ancillary throughput and storage services at distribution facilities are reported as a reduction of cost of sales   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value   investments   shortterm investments and noncurrent investments are accounted for primarily as availableforsale securities reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income unless fair value is below amortized cost ie the investment is impaired and the impairment is deemed otherthantemporary in which case some or all of the decline in value would be charged to earnings the carrying values of shortterm investments approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments   we also hold auction rate securities ars which are included in other assets they are classified as noncurrent assets as a result of continuing market illiquidity and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other market trading mechanisms develop we intend to hold our ars until a market recovery occurs and based on our current liquidity position we do not believe it is likely that these securities will need to be sold prior to their recovery in value therefore we expect to recover our cost basis in the investments as a result the unrealized holding loss on the ars is classified as a temporary impairment and is reported in other comprehensive income   also included in our investments are a trust fund and an escrow account that we utilize as a means of complying with regulations and consent decrees pertaining to financial assurance requirements for certain asset retirement obligations aros in florida these aro funds are carried at fair value as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet contributions to the aro funds are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow as investing activities   accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts   accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customers trade accounts receivable a receivable is past due if payments have not been received within the agreedupon invoice terms account balances are chargedoff against the allowance when management determines that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered   accounts receivable includes trade receivables and nontrade receivables such as miscellaneous nonproduct related billings   inventories   fertilizer inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a firstin firstout or average cost basis inventory includes the cost of materials production labor and production overhead inventory at warehouses and terminals also includes distribution costs net realizable value is reviewed at least quarterly fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales  86                table of contents     cf industries holdings inc   investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates   the equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence profits resulting from sales or purchases with equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investee or investor respectively losses in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate which are other than temporary are recognized when the current fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates is included in the other segment in our segment disclosures   our equity method investments for which the results are included in operating earnings consist of 1 50 ownership interest in plnl which operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago and 2 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas our share of the net earnings from these investments is reported as an element of earnings from operations because these operations provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment   our nonoperating equity method investments consist of 1 50 ownership in keytrade a fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland and 2 a 50 ownership in growhow which operates nitrogen production facilities in the united kingdom our share of the net earnings of these investments is not reported in earnings from operations since these operations do not provide us with additional capacity nor are these operations integrated within our supply chain advances to unconsolidated affiliates are loans made to keytrade and are classified as heldtomaturity debt securities and are reported at amortized cost   property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are stated at cost depreciation depletion and amortization are computed using the unitsofproduction method or the straightline method depreciable lives are as follows                   years       mobile and office equipment     3 to 12      production facilities and related assets     3 to 25      mining assets and phosphogypsum stacks     20      land improvements     10 to 20      buildings     10 to 45        we periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to production facilities and related assets as well as estimated production capacities used to develop unitsofproduction uop depreciation expense and we change the estimates to reflect the results of those reviews   scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at the companys continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years if the direct expense method were used all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated  87      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  statements of cash flows for additional information see note 18property plant and equipmentnet   recoverability of longlived assets   we review property plant and equipment and other longlived assets in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset   goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value   intangible assets identified with our acquisition of terra consist of customer relationships and trademarks which are being amortized over amortization periods of 18 years and 10 years respectively our intangible assets are presented in noncurrent other assets on the consolidated balance sheet   leases   leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated on the same basis as property plant and equipment rental payments including rent holidays leasehold incentives and scheduled rent increases are expensed on a straightline basis leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term including any applicable renewals   income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a  88      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the companys nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which is considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income taxes have been recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   derivative financial instruments   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments currently used are fixed price swaps and options traded in the overthecounter markets the derivatives reference primarily nymex futures contract prices which represent the basis for fair value at any given time these derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings   derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as current or noncurrent assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet the fair values of derivative instruments and any related cash collateral are reported on a gross basis rather than on a net basis   cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities cash flows related to foreign currency derivatives are reported as investing activities since they hedge future payments for the construction of long term assets   we do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives for additional information see note 25derivative financial instruments   asset retirement obligations   asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value when initially recognized the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset in subsequent periods depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded for additional information see note 10asset retirement obligations  89                table of contents   cf industries holdings inc   our most significant aros are driven by regulations in florida governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in hardee county florida other aros consist of conditional aros for the plant city bartow and hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date these aros relate to cessation of operations and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials asbestos equipment vessels piping and storage tanks   we also have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value   customer advances   customer advances represent cash received from customers following acceptance of orders under the companys forward sales programs such advances typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value and are generally collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating accounts receivable from customers upon shipment revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers   environmental   environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety or efficiency of the operations or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated environmental liabilities are not discounted   stockbased compensation   we grant stockbased compensation awards under the cf industries holdings inc 2009 equity and incentive plan the

become applicable to our consolidated financial statements it should be noted that the accounting standards references provided below reflect the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc and related accounting standards updates asu   recently adopted pronouncements   in may 2011 the fasb issued a standard that is intended to improve comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards asu no 201104 this standard clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including 1 the application of the highest and best use valuation premise 2 the methodology to measure the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entitys stockholders equity 3 disclosure requirements for quantitative information on level 3 fair value measurements and 4 guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio in addition the standard requires additional disclosures of the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs for level 3 securities this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in june 2011 the fasb issued a standard that pertains to the presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 this standard requires that comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the standard also requires entities to disclose on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net earnings this standard no longer allows companies to present components of other comprehensive income only in the  91      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  statement of equity in december 2011 the fasb deferred the new requirement to present the reclassification components of other comprehensive income in the statement of operations by issuing asu no 201112 see discussion of asu no 201302 below the remaining components of the original asu no 201105 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in september 2011 the fasb issued a standard to simplify the process for determining goodwill impairment asu no 201108 this standard gives an entity the option as a first step to assess qualitative factors in determining whether a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test must be performed if an assessment of qualitative factors leads to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep test is deemed unnecessary this standard is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   recently issued pronouncements   in december 2011 the fasb issued a standard pertaining to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu no 201111 this standard requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements including financial instruments and derivative instruments and the effect these arrangements have on the entitys financial position in january 2013 the fasb issued an amendment to asu no 201111 asu no 201301 clarifying that its scope applies to derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement these standards are effective for disclosures in interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures   in february 2013 the fasb issued a standard pertaining to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci asu no 201302 the standard requires that an entity provide by component information regarding the amounts reclassified out of aoci either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes and an indication as to the line items in the statement of operations that the amounts were reclassified to in addition in certain cases an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional details about the reclassified amounts this standard is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  4 noncontrolling interest   canadian fertilizers limited cfl   cfl owns a nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta canada which supplies fertilizer products to cf industries inc and viterra inc viterra cfls medicine hat complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in canada with two worldscale ammonia plants a worldscale granular urea plant and onsite storage facilities for both ammonia and urea   cf industries inc owns 49 of cfls voting common shares and 66 of cfls nonvoting preferred shares viterra owns 34 of the voting common shares and nonvoting preferred shares of  92      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  cfl the remaining 17 of the voting common shares are owned by growmark inc and la coop fédérée cfl is a variable interest entity that we consolidate in our financial statements   general creditors of cfl do not have direct recourse to the assets of cf industries inc however the product purchase agreement between cf industries inc and cfl does require cf industries inc to advance funds to cfl in the event that cfl is unable to meet its obligations as they become due the amount of each advance would be at least 66 of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which cf industries inc purchased more than 66 of medicine hats production a similar purchase agreement and obligation also exists for viterra cf industries inc and viterra currently manage cfl such that each party is responsible for its share of cfls fixed costs and that cfls production volume is managed to meet the parties combined requirements based on the contractual arrangements cf industries inc is the primary beneficiary of cfl as cf industries inc directs the activities that most significantly impact cfls economic performance and receives at least 66 of the economic risks and rewards of cfl   cfls net sales were 2171 million and 7096 million and 4540 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively cfls net sales in 2012 were impacted by the selling price modification discussed further below cfls assets and liabilities at december 31 2012 were 1081 million and 576 million respectively and at december 31 2011 were 5285 million and 4795 million respectively   because cfls functional currency is the canadian dollar consolidation of cfl results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported in other comprehensive income loss in accordance with cfls governing agreements cfls net earnings are distributed to its members annually based on approval by cfls shareholders a portion of the amounts reported as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations represents viterras 34 interest in the earnings of cfl while a portion of the amounts reported as noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets represent the interests of viterra and the holders of 17 of cfls common shares   cf industries inc operates the medicine hat facility pursuant to a management agreement and purchases approximately 66 of the facilitys ammonia and granular urea production pursuant to a product purchase agreement viterra has the right but not the obligation to purchase the remaining 34 of the facilitys production under a similar product purchase agreement to the extent that viterra does not purchase its 34 of the facilitys production cf industries inc is obligated to purchase any remaining amounts however since 1995 viterra has purchased at least 34 of the facilitys production each year both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either cf industries inc or cfl upon a twelvemonth notice   under the product purchase agreements that were in effect until the fourth quarter of 2012 both cf industries inc and viterra paid the greater of production cost or market price for purchases an initial portion of the selling price was paid based upon production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passes as the products were shipped the remaining portion of the selling price representing the difference between the market price and production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid after the end of the year the sales revenue attributable to this remaining portion of the selling price was accrued on an interim basis in the companys consolidated financial statements the net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl are solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries are eliminated in consolidation at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the net receivable due from viterra related to the product purchases that was reflected on our consolidated balance sheets was 20 million and 1410 million respectively see further discussion below regarding a modification to the cfl selling prices which reduced the net receivable due from viterra  93      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   the product purchase agreements also provide that cfl will distribute its net earnings to cf industries inc and viterra annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from cfl the net earnings attributable to viterra that are reported in noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 were approximately 53 million and 1497 million respectively the annual distribution is paid after the end of the year the distributions to viterra are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends   in august 2012 cf industries holdings inc entered into an agreement to acquire viterras interest in cfl for a total purchase price of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark inc and la coop fédérée to acquire the common shares of cfl owned by those parties as a result of these transactions we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls nitrogen fertilizer production the completion of these transactions is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive agreements   in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved an amendment to the product purchase agreements the amendment modified the selling prices that cfl charges for products sold to viterra and cf industries the modified selling prices are based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and are effective retroactive to january 1 2012 as a result of the january 1 2012 effective date the company has recognized in its fourth quarter 2012 consolidated statement of operations a reduction in net sales to viterra of 1297 million and a corresponding reduction in earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest to reverse the interim market price accruals recognized in the first three quarters of 2012 the net effect of this change had no impact on the companys net earnings attributable to common stockholders but did reduce the companys reported net sales gross margin operating earnings and earnings before income taxes by 1297 million in the fourth quarter the selling price modification also had no impact on the companys net cash flows as the selling price modification was entirely offset by a change in the distributions payable to the noncontrolling interest   terra nitrogen company lp tnclp   tnclp is a master limited partnership that owns a nitrogen manufacturing

techniques for assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis   cash and cash equivalents   at december 31 2012 and 2011 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us and canadian government obligations and money market mutual funds that invest in us government obligations and other investmentgrade securities   derivative instruments   the derivative instruments that we currently use are fixed price natural gas swaps and options and foreign currency forward contracts traded in the overthecounter markets with either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions the natural gas derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods the foreign currency derivative contracts held are for the exchange of a specified notional amount of currencies at specified future dates coinciding with anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with our donaldsonville la and port neal ia capital expansion projects the natural gas contracts settle using nymex futures prices and accordingly to determine the fair value of these instruments we use quoted market prices from nymex and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party the currency derivatives are valued based on quoted market prices supplied by an industry recognized unrelated third party see note 25derivative financial instruments for additional information   asset retirement obligation funds   in order to meet financial assurance requirements associated with certain aros in florida we maintain investments in an escrow account established for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep and a trust established to comply with a 2010 consent decree with the us environmental

availableforsale securities and are included on our consolidated balance sheets in other assets they are classified as noncurrent assets as a result of the continuing market illiquidity and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes or other effective market trading mechanisms develop these ars have maturities that range up to 35 years with 63 of the carrying value maturing in 20 to 30 years   we currently intend to hold our ars until a market recovery occurs and based on our current liquidity position we do not believe it is likely that we will need to sell these securities prior to their recovery in value therefore we expect to recover our amortized cost basis in the investments as a result our unrealized holding loss on these securities is classified as a temporary impairment and is reported in other comprehensive income loss during 2012 484 million of our ars were redeemed at par   we are unable to use significant observable level 1 or level 2 inputs to value these investments and they are therefore classified as level 3 for purposes of the fair value disclosure requirements to determine the fair value of our ars we use a marktomodel approach that relies on discounted cash flows market data and inputs derived from similar instruments to arrive at the fair value of these instruments our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value for these instruments measured using level 3 inputs could occur in the future the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in these level 3 assets                   in millions

subject to regulations governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and regulations concerning site reclamation for phosphate rock mines our liability for phosphogypsum stack system costs includes the cost of stack closure at plant city and the costs of cooling pond closure postclosure monitoring and ongoing water treatment at both bartow and plant city the actual amounts to be spent will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in regulations it is possible that these factors could change at any time and impact the estimates closure expenditures for the bartow cooling pond are estimated to occur through 2016 closure expenditures for the plant city stack expansion are estimated to occur in the 2033 to 2037 time frame and closure of the plant city cooling pond is assumed to occur in the year 2087 additional aros may be incurred in the future   the liability for mine reclamation costs is primarily for work involving the recontouring revegetation and reestablishment of wildlife habitat and hydrology of land disturbed by phosphate rock mining activities in accordance with regulations in florida physical reclamation and restoration of disturbed areas is generally required to be completed within a prescribed time frame after completion of mining operations and the timing of reconnection to surrounding lands and waterways varies based on achievement of applicable release criteria the actual time required to complete the work may vary depending on sitespecific reclamation plans and other circumstances   the 151 million change in estimate in 2010 relates primarily to a change in the reclamation plan at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine that resulted from changes in cost scope and timing of reclamation activities of this amount 92 million was recorded as an increase in property plant and equipment and 59 million was charged to earnings  108      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   the 60 million change in estimate in 2011 relates primarily to changes in the scope of closure activities of our bartow phosphogypsum stack system and mine reclamation activities at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine of this amount 66 million was charged to earnings and an offsetting 06 million was recorded as a decrease in property plant and equipment   the 36 million change in estimate in 2012 relates primarily to changes in mining and reclamation plans at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine of this amount 65 million was recorded as a decrease in property plant and equipment and 29 million was charged to cost of sales the 134 million liability incurred in 2012 relates primarily to the expansion of our phosphogysum stack at the plant city florida phosphate facility this expansion will allow us to continue to operate the plant city facility through the life of our current phosphate rock reserves   in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance requirements related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex there are two sources of these financial assurance requirements first in 2010 we entered into a consent decree with the epa and the fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city complex the plant city consent decree second the state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we have established a trust account for the benefit of the epa and fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheet these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds in october 2012 we deposited 530 million into the trust for the plant city consent decree thereby reaching full funding of that obligation and we expect to fund the remaining approximately 40 million in the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding will be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the balance in the aro funds was 2008 million and 1454 million respectively   prior to the plant city consent decree the companys financial assurance requirements for the closure water treatment longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the plant city phosphogypsum stack system were determined solely by florida regulations that would have required funding of the escrow account over a period of years the plant city consent decree described above effectively requires the company to fund the greater of the requirements under the plant city consent decree or florida law which may vary over time we are still required under florida law to maintain the existing florida escrow account for the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system at our closed bartow phosphate complex   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2012 dollars is 510 million we have not recorded a liability for these  109      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  conditional aros at december 31 2012 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion  11 income taxes   the components of earnings before income

financial instruments   we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates   commodity price risk management   natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of primarily derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the natural gas derivative instruments that we currently use are fixedprice swap and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets the derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are entered into with respect to gas to be consumed in the future and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting   as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 589 million mmbtus and 1563 million mmbtus

information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source review new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at the plant city facility the company provided the requested information to the epa in late 2007 the epa initiated this same process in relation to numerous other sulfuric acid plants and phosphoric acid plants throughout the nation including other facilities in florida   the company received a notice of violation nov from the epa by letter dated june 16 2010 the nov alleges the company violated the prevention of significant deterioration psd clean air act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the plant city facilitys sulfuric acid plants this nov further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged psd violations also resulted in violations of title v air operating permit regulations finally the nov alleges that the company failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants although this matter has been referred to the united states department of justice doj the company has continued to meet with the epa to discuss these alleged violations the company does not know at this time if it will settle this matter prior to initiation of formal legal action  134      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   we cannot estimate the potential penalties fines or other expenditures if any that may result from the clean air act nov and therefore we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows   epcracercla investigation   pursuant to a letter from the doj dated july 28 2008 that was sent to representatives of the major us phosphoric acid manufacturers including cf industries the doj stated that it and the epa believe that apparent violations of section 313 of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra which requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals have occurred at all of the phosphoric acid facilities operated by these manufacturers the letter also states that the doj and the epa believe that most of these facilities have violated section 304 of epcra and section 103 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla by failing to provide required notifications relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride from these facilities the letter did not specifically identify alleged violations at our plant city florida complex or assert a claim for a specific amount of penalties the epa submitted an information request to the company on february 11 2009 as a followup to the july 2008 letter the company provided information in response to the agencys inquiry on may 14 and may 29 2009   by letter dated july 6 2010 the epa issued a nov to the company alleging violations of epcra and cercla the company had an initial meeting with the epa to discuss these alleged violations the company does not

material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows   federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation   on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013   in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed  135      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court   on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation   moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation   the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule   depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows   louisiana environmental matters   clean air actsection 185 fee   our donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a fiveparish region near baton rouge louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville facility located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 the fee was to be assessed for each calendar year beginning in 2006 until the area achieved compliance with the ozone naaqs   prior to the imposition of section 185 fees the epa adopted a new ozone standard the 8hour ozone standard and rescinded the 1hour ozone standard the baton rouge area was designated as a moderate nonattainment area with respect to the 8hour ozone standard however because section 185 fees had never been assessed prior to the rescission of the 1hour ozone standard rescinded prior to the november 30 2005 ozone attainment deadline the epa concluded in a 2004 rulemaking implementing the 8hour ozone standard that the act did not require states to assess section 185 fees as a result section 185 fees were not assessed against cf industries and other companies located in the baton rouge area  136      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   in 2006 the federal dc circuit court of appeals rejected the epas position and held that section 185 fees were controls that must be maintained and fees should have been assessed under the act in january 2008 the us supreme court declined to accept the case for review making the appellate courts decision final   in july 2011 the epa approved a revision to louisianas air pollution program that eliminated the requirement for baton rouge area companies to pay section 185 fees based on baton rouges ultimate attainment of the 1hour standard through permanent and enforceable emissions reductions epas approval of the louisiana air program revision became effective on august 8 2011 however a recent decision by the federal dc circuit court of appeals struck down a similar but perhaps distinguishable epa guidance document regarding alternatives to section 185 fees at this time the viability of epas approval of louisianas elimination of section 185 fees is uncertain regardless of the approach ultimately adopted by the epa we expect that it is likely to be challenged by the environmental community the states andor affected industries therefore the costs associated with compliance with the act cannot be determined at this time and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows   clean air act information request   on february 26 2009 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source

and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho to contribute to a cleanup of the former processing portion of the site we declined to participate in the cleanup the current owner conducted a cleanup of the former processing portion of the site pursuant to a consent judgment with the idaho department of environmental quality ideq the current owner could bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution to the cleanup costs although we do not have sufficient information to determine whether or when such a lawsuit will be brought in 2011 the current owner and we received a notice from ideq that alleged that these parties were potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of the former mine portion of the site ideq requested from each party an indication of its willingness to enter into negotiations for a remedial investigation of the former mine portion of the site the current owner indicated a willingness to negotiate while reserving all rights and not admitting liability we also indicated a willingness to negotiate we are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability if any with respect to the cleanup of the former mine portion of the site
