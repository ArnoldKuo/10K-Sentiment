    in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers   the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 and a high of 377 per mmbtu on november 27 2012 during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012   changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of high natural gas prices if this were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   over the last several years north american natural gas prices have declined in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our results of operations tend to be negatively impacted   historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade   periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity   during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production  18      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers   we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities   some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships   china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese policy encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we may face increased competition from russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate almost all urea imports from russia and ukraine are currently subject to antidumping duty orders that impose duties of approximately 65 percent on urea imported into the united states from these two countries russia and ukraine currently have considerable capacity to produce urea and are among the worlds largest urea exporters in russia the price for natural gas used for industrial production continues to be set by the government on a nonmarket basis russian nitrogen fertilizer producers benefit from these governmentcontrolled natural gas prices encouraging inefficient urea production and high volumes of exports in ukraine we believe that the government intervenes with respect to natural gas prices available to fertilizer producers so as to permit continued exports the antidumping orders have been in place since 1987 and there has been very little urea imported into the united states from russia or ukraine since that time the us department of commerce regularly reviews the us sales of urea made by russian exporters in october 2011 the us department of commerce completed a review of us sales made by the russian exporter eurochem and concluded that duties of approximately one percent should be imposed this low rate of duty resulted in a marked increase in exports of russian urea to the united states in october 2012 the commerce department completed another review of eurochems sales and reduced to zero the duty applied to eurochems us urea imports this may result in more russian urea exports to the united states   in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission conducted the third sunset review of the urea antidumping orders and determined that they should remain in effect for another five years the next sunset review of those orders will not be initiated until late 2016   russia is the worlds largest ammonium nitrate producer and exporter as in the case of urea russian ammonium nitrate producers benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia is subject to an antidumping duty order which currently imposes antidumping duties of almost 254 percent on russian ammonium nitrate imports into the united states in may 2011 this order replaced a longstanding suspension agreement which had imposed volume and pricing restrictions on russian ammonium nitrate imports in 2011 the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission completed the second sunset review of the  19      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  russian ammonium nitrate antidumping order and concluded that it will remain in effect for at least another five years russian producers of ammonium nitrate are likely to participate in legal processes through which they may reduce the applicable antidumping duty rate applicable to their us imports and if they are successful there may be an increase in us imports of unfairly priced russian ammonium nitrate further one russian producer is currently seeking permission to import an ammonium nitrate product outside the reach of the antidumping order if successful this effort would likely result in a significant increase in us imports of this russian ammonium nitrate product   fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from ukraine is also subject to an antidumping duty order under which imports of this product are currently subject to a duty of over 156 percent that order is currently being reviewed and a decision as to whether the order will remain in place for an additional five years is expected to be issued by may 2013 if the order is revoked we are likely to experience a significant increase in us imports of unfairly priced ukrainian ammonium nitrate   a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products   conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control   state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications in recent years for example ethanol production in the united states has increased significantly due in part to federal legislation mandating greater use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment   our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations   we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards  20      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products   if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities these efforts by the railroads include i requesting that the surface transportation board or stb issue a policy statement finding that it is reasonable for a railroad to require a shipper to indemnify the railroads and carry insurance for all liability above a certain amount arising from the transportation of tih materials ii requesting that the stb approve an increase in the maximum reasonable rates that a railroad can charge for the transportation of tih materials including the recovery of the cost to implement the mandatory anticollision train control system referred to as positive train control iii lobbying for new legislation or regulations that would limit or eliminate the railroads common carrier obligation to transport tih materials and iv limit the liability or railroads in canada when transporting tih materials if the railroads were to succeed in one or more of these initiatives it could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products   difficulties in the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results   since the terra acquisition cf industries continued to utilize legacy terras separate information management systems to process transactions involving business operations of the legacy terra plants in the first quarter of 2013 we consolidated all business processes for the combined companies under a new single enterprise resource planning erp system utilizing software provided by sap this companywide system aligns business processes and procedures institutes more efficient transaction processing and improves access to and consistency of information to enable standardization of business activities the implementation of an erp system across the combined organization entails certain risks if we do not complete the implementation of the system successfully or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner it could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures  21      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks compromises to our information systems could have severe financial and other business implications   adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations   weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products   adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns   weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise   we may not be able to complete our recently announced capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control   on november 1 2012 we announced that we will construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties   the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms although we have entered into contracts with an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde for engineering and procurement services for each of the projects and we have procured bids from several construction firms we have not yet entered into definitive agreements for construction services for either project if thyssenkrupp uhde or any of the other third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected   we must also obtain numerous regulatory approvals and permits in order to construct and operate the additional plants these requirements may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all our financial exposure to permitting risks may be exacerbated because we have committed to purchase certain equipment that will result in substantial expenditures prior to obtaining all permits necessary to operate the units in the event that we ultimately fail to obtain all necessary permits we would be forced to abandon the projects and lose the benefit of any construction costs already incurred in addition federal and state governmental requirements may increase our costs substantially which could  22      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities   other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences   we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes   as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment   violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  23                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses   we may be impacted by the development of federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013   in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court   on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation   moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation   the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule  24      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities   we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex   florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as of december 31 2012 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 12 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at  25      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city with the completion of our phase ii expansion that is currently being constructed this stack has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this time frame is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us   our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality   the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season   if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly  26      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results   a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets   under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2012 and 2011 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 17 and 21 respectively of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments   we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment   we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2012 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 23 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses   we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues   in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward  27      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist   our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity   in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements   our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses   our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities   we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage   we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities   our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate  28      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city
