1990s we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly spending approximately 1 billion in each of these decades   we operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002 when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective rather than assured supply to our owners a critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace   in august 2005 we completed our initial public offering ipo of common stock which is listed on the new york

primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers   in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium and koch nitrogen there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry we experience competition

fluctuations   seasonality   the sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant  11      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just

environmental health and safety capital expenditures in 2012 totaled approximately 452 million in 2013 we estimate that we will spend approximately 613 million for environmental health and safety capital expenditures the increase in expenditures in 2013 is primarily related to certain projects to reduce emissions from our facilities including projects to improve the integrity and capacity of storage tanks at certain plant locations environmental health and safety laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we expect that continued

29contingencies   federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation   on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court the court on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious the court ordered the epa to issue proposed or final numeric nutrient criteria for streams by may 21 2012 subject to the epa seeking an extension of such time period pursuant to the terms of the 2009 consent decree subsequently the court granted the epas motion to allow the epa to propose numeric nutrient criteria for streams by november 30 2012 and to finalize such criteria by august 31 2013   in december 2011 the state of florida proposed its own numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters the nitrogen and phosphorous criteria in the proposed rule are substantially identical to the federal rule but the state proposal includes biological verification as a component of the criteria and adopts existing nutrient total maximum daily loads tmdl as applicable numeric criteria the impact of these modifications could be to provide more flexibility with respect to nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits so long as such discharges do not impair the biological health of receiving water bodies environmental groups filed a challenge to the proposed  13      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  state rule but the rule was upheld by an administrative law judge on june 8 2012 and became final an appeal of the administrative decision upholding the rule is now pending before a florida appellate court   on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas rule however because the epa identified what it considered to be gaps in the scope of the waters covered by floridas rule and potential legal issues that might bar the florida rule from going into effect the epa pursuant to the court order described above has again proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida streams there is substantial uncertainty as to whether this rule will be withdrawn before it is finalized or if a rule is finalized as to the scope of florida inland flowing waters that will be covered by the epa regulation   moreover notwithstanding the epas approval of the florida rule the federal criteria for lakes and inland waters previously upheld by the court excluding the criteria found to be arbitrary and capricious became effective on january 6 2013 the epa has proposed to stay the effective date of these criteria in light of the ongoing developments with the florida regulation   the 2009 consent decree also requires the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the numeric criteria adopted by the state of florida and approved by the epa includes numeric criteria for some coastal and estuarine waters but as with streams epa has raised issues regarding the scope of coverage of floridas regulation accordingly on november 30 2012 the epa proposed numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters the epa must finalize these criteria by september 30 2013 unless future developments allow the epa to withdraw the rule   depending on the developments discussed herein federal or state numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   regulation of greenhouse gases   we are subject to regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states concerning climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions   the united kingdom is a party to the

a party to the kyoto protocol but a signatory to the durban platform with respect to the negotiation of a replacement for the kyoto protocol ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels the epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facilities including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in may 2010 the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later the title v permitting program beginning in january 2011 and the regulation could significantly decrease the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations in the future on december 20 2012 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected a request to reconsider its decision to uphold the ghg regulations regulation of ghg emissions pursuant to the psd program could subject new capital projects to additional permitting requirements that may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects   under the title v

nitric acid plants   we operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas   regulatory permits and approvals   we hold numerous environmental and mining permits authorizing operations at our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals   as of december 31 2012 the area permitted for mining at our hardee phosphate complex had approximately 422 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which we expect to meet our  15      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  requirements at current production rates for approximately 12 years we have secured the necessary permits to mine these reserves from the fdep and the us army corps of engineers we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated additional 347 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which we expect will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area the estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting efforts in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue andor expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business

including additional expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits this date is approximately six years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and
