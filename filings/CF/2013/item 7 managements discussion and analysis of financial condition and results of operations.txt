are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors our principal fertilizer products in the nitrogen segment are ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution or uan and ammonium nitrate or an our other nitrogen products include urea liquor diesel exhaust fluid or def and aqua ammonia which are sold primarily to our industrial customers our principal fertilizer products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate or dap and monoammonium phosphate or map   our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern united states and other major agricultural areas of the us and canada we also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our donaldsonville louisiana manufacturing facilities and phosphate fertilizer products from our florida phosphate operations through our tampa port facility   our principal assets include   five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in donaldsonville louisiana the largest nitrogen fertilizer

affecting comparability of results   cfl selling price modification   cf industries currently owns 49 of the voting common shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canadabased nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and purchases 66 of the production of cfl pursuant to a product purchase agreement between cf industries and cfl viterra inc viterra holds 34 of cfls voting common shares and nonvoting preferred shares and purchases the remaining 34 of cfls production pursuant to a product purchase agreement between viterra and cfl cfl is a variable interest entity that is consolidated in our financial statements as a result the net sales the resulting earnings and the noncontrolling interest expense from the 34 of cfls sales that are made to viterra are included in our consolidated financial results there is no net impact of these cfl sales to viterra on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders since the net earnings from the 34 of cfls sales that are made to viterra are included in our earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest there is also no impact on our net cash flows since profits from the sales to viterra are paid to viterra as part of the distribution payable to the noncontrolling interest the net sales from cfl to viterra do impact our consolidated net sales gross margin operating earnings and earnings before income taxes   under the provisions of cfls respective product purchase agreements with cf industries and viterra in effect until the fourth quarter of 2012 cfls selling prices were based on market prices an initial portion of the selling price was paid based upon production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passed as the product was shipped the remaining portion of the selling price representing the difference between the market price and production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid  40      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  after the end of the year the sales revenue attributable to this remaining portion of the selling price was accrued on an interim basis on our consolidated financial statements the net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl are generated solely by cfls transactions with viterra as cfls transactions with cf industries are eliminated in consolidation   in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved an amendment to each of the respective product purchase agreements of cf industries and viterra with cfl the amendments modified the selling prices that cfl charges for products sold to cf industries and viterra the modified selling prices are based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and are effective retroactively to january 1 2012 as a result of the january 1 2012 effective date of the amendment we recognized in our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated statement of operations a reduction in net sales revenue from viterra of 1297 million and a corresponding reduction in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest to reverse the interim market price accruals recognized in the first three quarters of 2012 these items had no impact on our net earnings attributable to common stockholders but they did reduce each of our consolidated net sales gross margin operating earnings earnings before income taxes and net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest by 1297 million in the fourth quarter the selling price modification also had no impact on our net cash flows as the selling price modification was entirely offset by a change in distributions payable to the noncontrolling interest   the cfl selling price modification effective retroactively to january 1 2012 affected the comparability between the 2012 and 2011 results for certain line items in our financial statements to provide comparable information for those periods we have included in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain financial information on an as adjusted basis as if all cfl sales to viterra had been priced based on the modified pricing calculation methodology production cost plus an agreedupon margin beginning january 1 2011 such information includes net sales gross margin net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest nitrogen net sales nitrogen gross margin nitrogen gross margin

table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   terra industries inc terra acquisition   in april 2010 we completed the acquisition and merger of terra a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of 46 billion terras financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results and in the nitrogen segment results since the acquisition date of april 5 2010 therefore terras financial results are not included in the consolidated financial results for the first quarter of 2010 further information regarding the acquisition of terra including the related issuance of longterm debt and the public offering of common shares of cf holdings can be found in notes 12 and 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report and in the section titled acquisition of terra later in this discussion and analysis   financial executive summary    we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 18 billion in 2012 compared to net earnings of 15 billion in 2011 our 2012 results included a 746 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket gain 462 million after tax on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees associated with the termination of our former senior secured credit agreement the 2010 credit agreement which was replaced by a new unsecured credit agreement dated may 1 2012 the 2012 credit agreement and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased to 2859 in 2012 from 2198 in 2011 due to higher net earnings and lower average number of outstanding common shares due to our share repurchase program  net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion in 2011 included a 773 million pretax unrealized net marktomarket loss 480 million after tax on natural gas derivatives a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our former woodward oklahoma methanol plant a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses 199 million 123 million after tax of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs recognized upon repayment of the remaining balance of the senior secured term loan in the first quarter of 2011 44 million 27 million after tax of restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of terra and a 20 million 13 million after tax gain on the sale of a noncore transportation business  our gross margin increased 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 due primarily to an increase in the nitrogen segment partially offset by a decline in the phosphate segment the increase in gross margin is impacted by the modification of the cfl selling prices described above on an as adjusted basis the gross margin increase was 13   in the nitrogen segment gross margin increased by 3504 million or 14 driven by higher average selling prices unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year compared to unrealized losses in the prior year and lower realized natural gas costs on an as adjusted basis the gross margin of the nitrogen segment increased 20 the favorable nitrogen segment results were partially offset by a 1327 million or 40 decrease in the phosphate segment gross margin driven primarily by lower average selling prices    our net sales were approximately 61 billion in both 2012 and 2011 slightly higher nitrogen segment sales were essentially offset by lower phosphate segment sales in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 2 as higher average selling prices for ammonia and urea and higher   42      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc    ammonia sales volume were partially offset by lower average uan selling prices and sales volume the comparability of nitrogen segment net sales is impacted by the 2012 modification of cfl selling prices on an as adjusted basis net sales in the nitrogen segment increased 5 in the phosphate segment net sales declined by 7 as higher sales volume was more than offset by a 12 decline in average selling prices    cash flow from operations was 24 billion in 2012 the 2967 million or 14 increase compared to 2011 was due mainly to additional cash generated by higher net earnings and an increase in customer advances  we paid cash dividends of 1027 million and 687 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase is due to an increase in the quarterly dividend to 040 per common share from 010 per common share which started in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by a reduction in the number of outstanding shares  on august 2 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with glencore international plc glencore to acquire the interests in cfl currently owned by viterra for total cash consideration of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark inc growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them when the transactions are completed we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and urea production the completion of the transactions is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive purchase agreements cfls results are currently included in our financial statements as a consolidated variable interest entity   on november 1 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea plants at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects these projects will increase our production capacity increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our costadvantaged port neal location and allow us to benefit from the global cost advantage of north american natural gas all of the new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings    significant items  2012   robust demand in 2012 for nitrogen fertilizer products was due to favorable application conditions in both the spring and the fall near record corn acreage planted in 2012 and expectations of a similar level of acreage to be planted in 2013 high actual and expected planting levels were driven by record crop prices that resulted in record farm income these market conditions led to higher average selling prices in the nitrogen segment in 2012 that combined with lower natural gas costs resulted in record profitability average selling prices in our phosphate segment were down due to lower demand from india and additional production capacity notably from saudi arabia consolidated net sales of 61 billion in 2012 approximated the same level realized in 2011 as increases in the nitrogen segment due primarily to the higher average selling prices were offset by decreases in the phosphate segment due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2012 average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices increased by 2 but average phosphate fertilizer selling prices decreased by 12 gross margin increased by 2177 million or 8 to 31 billion in 2012 from 29 billion in 2011 nitrogen segment sales to viterra were made on a costplus basis in 2012 in contrast to the marketprice basis that applied in  43      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  2011 and prior years a difference that impacts the comparability of net sales and certain other items between 2012 and prior periods and is discussed above under the heading items affecting comparability of resultscfl selling price modification the 2012 results include 746 million 462 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives a 152 million pretax charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred fees on the 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  2011   in 2011 average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which supported favorable farm economics global fertilizer supply constraints resulting from both export restrictions and production curtailments affecting certain foreign fertilizer producers and an expected high level of planted acres and fertilizer usage in the 2012 growing season higher average selling prices and sales volumes due to increased demand led to robust operating results in 2011 consolidated net sales in 2011 increased by 21 billion or 54 to 61 billion with increases due primarily to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments and higher sales volume due primarily to the impact of the terra acquisition in 2011 average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively gross margin increased by 17 billion or 146 to 29 billion in 2011 from 12 billion in 2010 the 2011 results include a 773 million 480 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket loss on natural gas derivatives results in 2011 also include 1455 million of net interest expense 902 million after tax a 348 million pretax 216 million after tax noncash impairment charge related to our woodward oklahoma methanol plant and a 325 million 200 million after tax gain on the sale of four dry product warehouses  2010   in april 2010 we completed the 46 billion acquisition of terra and it became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf holdings this acquisition made us a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer industry diversified our asset base and increased our geographic reach and operational efficiency as well as significantly increased our scale and capital market presence the financial results of the terra business are included in the consolidated results subsequent to the acquisition date consolidated net sales in 2010 were 40 billion up 52 as compared to 26 billion in 2009 due to the impact of the terra acquisition optimal weather conditions during both fertilizer application seasons and a favorable fertilizer environment due to strong farm economics while average nitrogen fertilizer selling prices declined by 11 in 2010 average phosphate fertilizer prices increased by 28 gross margin increased by 3401 million or 41 in 2010 to 11795 million the 2010 results include a 96 million 59 million after tax unrealized net marktomarket gain on natural gas derivatives results in 2010 also include 2198 million of net interest expense 1361 million after tax 1504 million 1488 million after tax of business combination

costs associated with the acquisition of terra  44                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    key industry factors   we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below   global supply amp demand   historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade   natural gas prices   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined over the last three years during the three year period ended december 31 2012 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 751 per mmbtu on january 8 2010 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 39 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2012 down from 45 in 2011 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization   farmers economics   the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted   global trade in fertilizer   in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of  45      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world   imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east the ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america   the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   political and social government policies   the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives   factors affecting our results   net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a

basis net sales increased 2   in the nitrogen segment net sales increased by 845 million or 2 due primarily to higher nitrogen fertilizer average selling prices which were partially offset by lower sales volume average selling prices for nitrogen fertilizer increased due primarily to positive market conditions as favorable weather created a longer application window tight world market conditions existed for ammonia and urea due to lower international ammonia production and tight domestic supply conditions existed due to increased demand caused by the high level of planted acres and low

phosphate fertilizer average selling prices and sales volumes including the impact of the terra acquisition average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices increased by 38 and 36 respectively average selling prices increased due primarily to higher demand for fertilizer for the following reasons higher planted acres in the spring season due to strong demand for corn and other grains which

of planted acres in 2012 and expected in 2013 and lower downstream inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnaround and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in

higher uan and an sales volumes partially offset by lower ammonia sales volume uan sales volume increased significantly during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of terra and the increased supply available from the woodward oklahoma uan plant expansion the increased uan production capacity allowed us to meet increased demand for uan resulting from favorable spring application conditions and customers replenishing depleted downstream inventories after the strong spring application season the increase in an sales in 2011 from the prior year is due to the inclusion of a full year of an sales in 2011 as the production capacity for this product was obtained in the terra acquisition the 2011 decrease in ammonia sales is due primarily to the additional ammonia required to

below   cash and cash equivalents   we had cash and cash equivalents of 23 billion and 12 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities   share repurchase programs   in the third quarter of 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 15 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2013 during 2011 we repurchased 65 million shares under the program for 10 billion and in the second quarter of 2012 we repurchased 31 million shares of cf holdings common stock for 5000 million thereby completing this program in june 2012 all 96 million shares that had been repurchased under this program were  61      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  retired in our consolidated balance sheet the retirement of these shares eliminated the recorded treasury stock and reduced retained earnings and paidin capital by 11259 million and 3742 million respectively as of june 30 2012   in the third quarter of 2012 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 30 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2016 repurchases under this program may be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise the manner timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by our management based on evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors there were no repurchases under this program in 2012   major capital expansion projects   in november 2012 we announced plans to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex our board of directors authorized expenditures of 38 billion for these projects in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable pricing advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through the use of cash and shortterm investments cash generated from operations and borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2012 we incurred capital expenditures of 1208 million on these projects contributing to the increase in capital expenditures in 2012 over those in 2011   we have retained engineering and procurement services from thyssenkrupp uhde uhde through their affiliate uhde corporation of america for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa expansion projects under the terms of the uhde contract we are required to establish a separate cash account and grant a security interest in the account to uhde we are required to maintain in this account a cash balance equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel these projects the amount of cash in the account will change over time based on procurement costs and is projected to reach approximately 500 million at certain points in time during the life of the projects at december 31 2012 there was no cash held in this account cash placed in this account in the future will be considered restricted cash since a security interest in the account has been granted to uhde this restricted cash will not be included in our cash and cash equivalents and will be reported separately on our consolidated balance sheet   capital spending   capital expenditures totaled 5235 million in 2012 as compared to 2472 million in 2011 and 2581 million in 2010 the increase in 2012 capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 1208 million capital expenditures for the two major capital expansion projects discussed above plus certain capital improvement projects at our production facilities capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements  62      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   projected capital spending   we expect to spend between 14 billion and 17 billion on capital projects during 2013 of which 10 billion to 13 billion relates to the major capital expansion projects at donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa discussed above planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in the cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties   acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in canadian fertilizers limited   in august 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire the 34 of cfls common and preferred shares owned by viterra and the product purchase agreement between viterra and cfl for a total purchase price of c09 billion subject to certain adjustments see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding cfl in october 2012 we entered into an agreement with each of growmark and la coop fédérée to acquire the cfl common shares held by them as a result of these transactions we will own 100 of cfl and will be entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and granular urea production the completion of these transactions is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in canada and other terms and conditions in the definitive agreements   repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes   we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis   at december 31 2012 approximately 8860 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 23 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries it is expected that a significant portion of this cash balance will be used to fund the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl noted above if the transaction is completed the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states at december 31 2012 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 45 million depending upon how we implement the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in cfl some or all of the canadian cash balances may be repatriated to the us resulting in the payment of the applicable portion of the foreign taxes on the repatriation   debt   at both december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 16 billion of senior notes outstanding in two series of 800 million each the first series carries an interest rate of 6875 and is due in the aggregate in 2018 the second series carries an interest rate of 7125 and is due in the aggregate in 2020 at  63      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  december 31 2011 we also had 130 million of terra 7 senior notes due 2017 which were redeemed in the second quarter of 2012   as of december 31 2012 4910 million was available for borrowing under our credit agreement net of 90 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings our 2012 credit agreement includes representations warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants and events of default our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2012 credit agreement and the senior notes indentures   forward sales and customer advances   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives and our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which may be several months after the order is placed as is the case for all of our sale transactions revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had approximately 3807 million and 2572 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets   while customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2012 and 2011 the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals the level of forward orders may reflect our customers views of the current fertilizer pricing environment and expectations regarding future pricing and availability of supply   under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales we may also be subject to storage charges under these arrangements should we be unable to deliver product at the specified time if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase also borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our  64      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity   derivative financial instruments   we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized loss or gain thresholds are exceeded for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties individual credit limits monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements   the master netting arrangements to some of our derivative instruments also contain creditriskrelated contingent features that require us to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios if we fail to meet these minimum requirements the counterparties to those derivative instruments where we hold liability positions could require daily cash settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support   as of december 31 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was 09 million we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts as of december 31 2012   financial assurance requirements   in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance requirements related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and our former bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex there are two sources of these financial assurance requirements first in 2010 we entered into a consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa and the florida department of environmental protection fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city florida complex the plant city consent decree second the state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we have established a trust account for the benefit of the epa and fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheet these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds in october 2012 we deposited 530 million into the trust for the plant city consent decree thereby reaching full funding of that obligation and we expect to fund the remaining approximately 40 million of the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding will be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts at december 31 2012 and 2011 the balance in the aro funds was 2008 million and 1454 million respectively  65                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems   florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods   acquisition of terra   in april of 2010 we completed the acquisition and merger of terra as a result of the merger each outstanding share of terra common stock was converted into the right to receive 3715 in cash and 00953 of a share of cf holdings common stock cf holdings issued an aggregate of 95 million shares of its common stock with a fair value of 8820 million and paid an aggregate of 32 billion in cash net of 05 billion cash acquired for 100 of terras common stock additional details regarding the terra acquisition can be found in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements   other liquidity requirements   we are subject to federal state and local laws and rules concerning surface and underground waters such rules evolve through various stages of proposal or development and the ultimate outcome of such rulemaking activities often cannot be predicted prior to enactment at the present time rules in the state of florida are being developed to limit nutrient content in water discharges including certain specific rules pertaining to water bodies near our florida operations additional information regarding numeric nutrient criteria regulations in surface and ground water can be found in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements titled contingencies we are monitoring the evolution of these rules potential costs associated with compliance cannot be determined currently and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   we contributed approximately 201 million to our pension plans in 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 232 million to our pension plans in 2013   cash flows   operating activities   year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011   net cash generated from operating activities in 2012 was 24 billion as compared to 21 billion in 2011 the 2967 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net earnings from the nitrogen segment and a lower level of working capital invested in the business at the end of 2012 as compared to the end of 2011 as lower inventory lower receivables and  66      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  higher customer advances and accounts payable and

billion as compared to 12 billion in 2010 the 8845 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to improved net earnings in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments

offset by 547 million in proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 379 million in sales and maturities of short term securities the proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in 2011 primarily related to the sale of four dry product warehouses and a noncore transportation business the 31 billion in cash used in investing activities in 2010 was due primarily to the net cash consideration of 32 billion for the acquisition of terra partially offset by 2096 million of cash provided by net sales of shortterm investments and redemptions of auction rate securities

for the repayment of long term debt compared to 3460 million in 2011 dividends paid on common stock increased to 1027 million in 2012 from 687 million in 2011 due to the increase in the common dividend to 040 per share from 010 per share which started in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by a reduction in number of outstanding shares net cash provided by financing activities in

plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews   scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment   inventory valuation   we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales   asset retirement obligations aros and environmental remediation liabilities   aros are legal obligations associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the bartow and plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complexes land reclamation activities at our hardee florida phosphate rock mine and the cessation of operations at all of our facilities if the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated aros are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service we are required to recognize an aro for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain the obligations at active facilities related to closure reclamation  71      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded the liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time the asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over the estimated useful life in the case of reclamation the asset is depreciated over the period the mining occurs which in some cases may be after initial recognition of the liability the aggregate carrying value of all of our aros was 1450 million as of december 31 2012 and 1316 million as of december 31 2011 the increase in the aggregate carrying value of these aros is due to normal accretion expense and the recognition of new obligations partially offset by cash expenditures on aros and reductions in previous estimates   environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts existing technology sitespecific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations in reporting environmental liabilities no offset is made for potential recoveries all liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur in accordance with gaap environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits changes in laws regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements the amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled 59 million as of december 31 2012 and 67 million as of december 31 2011   the actual amounts to be spent on aros and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments and cost inflation as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes we are also required to select discount rates to calculate the present value of aros changes in these estimates or the selection of a different discount rate could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2012 dollars is 510 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2012 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion   recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are  72      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review   the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately   we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2012 or 2011 reviews as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying value of our goodwill resulting mainly from the terra acquisition was 21 billion   fair value measurements   we have classified our investments in auction rate securities included in other assets as those measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 securities under the provisions of the current rules for assessing fair value no other assets or liabilities are classified as level 3 items on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning fair value measurements   derivative financial instruments   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur  73      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our capital expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting   income taxes   we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods   in connection with our ipo in august 2005 cfi ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and we entered into an nol agreement with cfis preipo owners relating to the future utilization of the preipo nols the nol agreement provided that if we ultimately could utilize the preipo nols to offset applicable postipo taxable income we would pay our preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved on january 2 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that  74      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  we are entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized with the irs at the irs appeals level see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the utilization of the nols   pension assets and liabilities   pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 8324 million at december 31 2012 which was 1125 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2012 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 40 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 575 million higher or 518 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed   the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2012 was 46 if the discount rate used to compute 2012 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 38 million higher or 29 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 57 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2012 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2012 would have been 30 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our pension plans   consolidation   we consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity and determining whether we direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns   we use the equity method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest representation on the board of directors participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions we regularly review our variable interest entities for potential changes in consolidation status   we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions  75                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    recent accounting pronouncements   see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements   discussion of seasonality impacts on operations   our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns
