    in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers   the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 308 per mmbtu on january 11 2013 and a high of 452 per mmbtu on december 24 2013 during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012   changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   north american prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected   historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade   periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity   during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production  18      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers   we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities   some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships   china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese government policy or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   russia and ukraine have significant capacity to produce and export nitrogen fertilizers and producers in these countries continue to pay belowmarket prices for natural gas due to ongoing government intervention in natural gas pricing competition in the united states with imports of solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine is currently subject to the discipline imposed by us antidumping duty orders which require such imports to be priced at or above fair value when sold in the us market the antidumping orders have affected the pricing of these imports and have also restrained the volumes imported however if there were to be significant decreases in the antidumping duty rates applied to most russian and ukrainian exporters we could face much higher volumes of lower priced russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in the united states the russian and ukrainian solid urea antidumping orders are expected to remain in place until at least december 2016 the russian ammonium nitrate order is currently scheduled to remain in place until at least august 2016 the ukrainian ammonium nitrate order is expected to remain in place until at least june 2018   a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products   conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control   state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand in part due to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics  19      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and to eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in november 2013 the epa proposed to reduce the renewable fuels volumes required for calendar year 2014 to around current consumption levels developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment   our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers which subjects us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposure to liability   we rely on railroad trucking pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards   these transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products   if shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products   our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses   our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these  20      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities   we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage   in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility we have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in 2013 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our product to west fertilizer co products we have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident based on the initial analysis of the pending lawsuits we believe that we have strong legal and factual defenses to the claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in the pending lawsuits and any other claims brought against us in connection with the incident in addition the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities   cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results   as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks compromises to our information systems could have severe financial and other business implications  21      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations   weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products   adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns   weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise   we may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control   on november 1 2012 we announced that we will construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects total invested on these projects through december 31 2013 was 6805 million   the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties   the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms if any of the third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected   our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities   other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences   we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize  22      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes   as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment   violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses   our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities   we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an  23      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex   florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as of december 31 2013 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 385 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 11 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city the phase ii expansion project was completed in july 2013 and will provide sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding construction and operating permits this time frame is approximately five years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our  24      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us   our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality   the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season   if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results   a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets  25      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 7 and 17 respectively of our cash and cash equivalents   we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment   we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2013 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses   we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues   in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist   our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity   in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large  26      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements   we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities   our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region   we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures   we participate in joint ventures including point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business   in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs   acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business   like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  27      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that such illicit use of our products could result in liability for the company   our operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business   we and our joint ventures use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to risks associated with international operations   our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2013 we derived approximately 18 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include our nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in courtright ontario a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products and a 50 interest in a fertilizer trading operation headquartered near zurich switzerland   our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses   our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 17 billion as of december 31 2013 we generally invest these cash and cash equivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us government those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities our investments are subject to fluctuations in both market value and yield based upon changes in  28      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  market conditions including interest rates liquidity general economic and credit market conditions and conditions specific to the issuers   due to the risks of investments we may not achieve expected returns or may realize losses on our investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial
