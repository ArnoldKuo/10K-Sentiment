one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 13 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2013 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america   bartow phosphate complex   we own a site in bartow florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex this complex ceased production in 1999 and the former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements   phosphate raw materials   phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p2o5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2013 our hardee rock mine had approximately 11 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area   sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p2o5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex

a role in the buying decisions of customers   in our nitrogen segment our primary north americanbased competitors include agrium inc and koch nitrogen company there is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world including some with lower natural gas costs because ammonia urea and uan are widelytraded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to

governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   seasonality   the sales patterns of our six major products are seasonal the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing

november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the federal district court court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious   subsequently the florida department of environmental protection fdep adopted its own nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for surface waters and related implementation standards on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas nutrient criteria and on june 27 2013 the epa approved new water quality standards submitted by the fdep relating to the scope of coverage of the fdeps numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters on january 7 2014 the us district court for the northern district of florida granted the epas motion to amend the 2009 consent decree as a result the epa is no longer required by the consent decree to promulgate numeric nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for certain surface waters that the fdep had determined were more properly regulated by the states

quality standards is still subject to challenge nonetheless numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters whether federal or state could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen
