shares and 66 of the nonvoting preferred shares of canadian fertilizers limited cfl an alberta canada based nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and had the right to purchase 66 of the production of cfl also prior to april 30 2013 viterra inc viterra held 34 of the equity ownership of cfl and had the right to purchase up to 34 of cfls production both cf industries and viterra were entitled to receive distributions of net earnings of cfl based upon their respective purchases from cfl cfl was a variable interest entity that was consolidated in our financial statements on april 30 2013 cf industries completed the acquisitions of all of the outstanding interests in cfl that it did not already own and cfl became our wholly owned subsidiary  40      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   cf industries and viterras purchases of nitrogen fertilizer products from cfl were made under product purchase agreements and the selling prices were determined under the provisions of these agreements an initial selling price was paid to cfl based upon cfls production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passed as the product was shipped at the end of the year the difference between the market price of products purchased from cfl and the price based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid to cfl the sales revenue attributable to this difference was accrued by the company on an interim basis until april 30 2013 when cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary in our financial statements net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl were solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries were eliminated in consolidation in our financial statements   in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved amendments to the product purchase agreements retroactive to january 1 2012 that modified the selling prices that cfl charged for products sold to viterra and cf industries which eliminated the requirement to pay to cfl the difference between the market price and the price based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin the following summarizes the selling prices in the product purchase agreements that impacted the companys results due to sales transactions to viterra both before and after the effective date of the amendment    for the 2011 annual reporting period the companys consolidated financial statements reflect marketbased selling prices for products purchased from cfl including sales made by cfl to viterra  for the 2012 annual reporting period and between the period of january 1 2013 and april 30 2013 cfl selling prices were based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin  starting on april 30 2013 cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary of cf industries once cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary cf industries began purchasing all of the output of cfl for resale and reported those sales in its consolidated financial statements at market prices    as a result the financial results for 2013 include four months of selling prices based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin and eight months of market based selling prices these selling price amendments to the product purchase

prepared in accordance with gaap   net operating loss nol settlement   at the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved at december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowance   in january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to them   in march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we have agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as follows   nol tax benefits of 758 million were recognized which reduced income tax expense   a charge of 552 million was recognized for the 731 portion of the nol benefit that will be paid to the preipo owners as the tax benefits are realized the 552 million charge is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other nonoperatingnet    financial executive summary    during 2013 we experienced lower net sales and net earnings as compared to the prior year due to weakness in the global fertilizer markets the lower earnings were due primarily to lower selling prices for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and higher natural gas costs as compared to the prior year the decline in global nitrogen selling prices was attributable to increased supply due primarily to higher exports from china the decline in phosphate selling prices reflected weaker demand from india   in 2013 we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion compared to net earnings of 18 billion in 2012 or a decline of 21 our 2013 results included 529 million of pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 335 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and 208 million of realized and unrealized net gains 132 million after tax on foreign currency derivatives related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa and a net 206 million benefit from a settlement with the irs concerning certain preipo nols   42      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc    net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 18 billion for 2012 included 665 million of net pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 412 million after tax on natural gas derivatives 81 million of realized and unrealized net gains 50 million after tax on foreign currency derivatives a 152 million charge 94 million after tax for the accelerated amortization of deferred loan fees on our 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 13 to 2474 in 2013 from 2859 for 2012 due to lower earnings partially offset by a lower average number of outstanding common shares due to our share repurchase program  our gross margin declined by 5931 million or 19 to 25 billion in 2013 from 31 billion in 2012 due to lower nitrogen and phosphate segment earnings as a result of lower average selling prices and lower phosphate sales volume in the nitrogen segment gross margin decreased by 4683 million or 16 due primarily to lower average selling prices in the phosphate segment gross margin decreased 1248 million or 62 due to declines in both average selling prices and volume  our net sales decreased 6293 million or 10 in 2013 compared to 2012 in the nitrogen segment net sales decreased by 8 due primarily to an 8 reduction in average selling prices in the phosphate segment net sales declined by 21 due to a 13 decline in average selling prices and a 9 decline in sales volume  net cash generated from operating activities during 2013 was 15 billion as compared to 24 billion in 2012 the 09 billion decline was due to the combination of lower net earnings and higher net working capital levels due primarily to lower accrued income taxes and lower customer advances as customers delayed purchasing decisions in 2013 as compared to the prior year  cash used in investing activities increased by 5058 million in 2013 to 10193 million as compared to 5135 million in the prior year the increase was due primarily to a 3003 million increase in capital expenditures and a 1540 million deposit into a restricted cash account both primarily related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa  in october 2013 we entered into a set of strategic agreements with mosaic the agreements include a definitive agreement to sell the entirety of cf industries phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida to mosaic for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement and agreements under which the company will supply mosaic with ammonia from its donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and the companys point lisas nitrogen ltd plnl joint venture  during 2013 we repurchased 73 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 19743 representing 12 of the prior year end outstanding shares at a cost of 14 billion    key industry factors   we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below  43      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   global supply amp demand   historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade   natural gas prices   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 natural gas costs rose 8 in 2013 from 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 41 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2013 up from 39 in 2012 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization   farmers economics   the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted   global trade in fertilizer   in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world  44      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america   the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   political and social government policies   the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives   factors affecting our results   net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales   cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives   selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our

prices versus the prior year was primarily due to increased supply as a result of higher urea exports from chinese producers during the low tariff export season the decline in ammonia prices versus the prior year was due to the combination of a weaker nitrogen pricing environment higher domestic production rates and inventory levels and reduced demand associated with unfavorable weather conditions during 2013 the cold and wet spring and the shortened fall application season reduced ammonia demand compared to the favorable application environment during 2012 the decline in uan prices versus the prior year was due primarily to higher global supply of nitrogen products   cost of sales cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged 172 per ton in 2013 compared to 168 per ton in 2012

prices increased to 393 per ton in 2012 from 385 per ton in 2011 with increases in ammonia and urea higher ammonia and urea average selling prices resulted from tight industrywide supply conditions due to increased us demand caused by the higher level of planted acres in 2012 and expected in 2013 and lower downstream inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnarounds and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in product mix favoring higher margin nitrogen products during the year   cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 the 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs and 665 million in unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in

to year ended december 31 2012   net sales phosphate segment net sales decreased 2105 million or 21 to 7969 million in 2013 compared to 10 billion in 2012 due to a 13 decline in average selling prices and a 9 decrease in volume average dap and map selling prices each decreased 13 with dap decreasing from 493 to 427 per ton and map decreasing from 502 to 437 per ton due primarily to lower global demand notably india and buyers delaying purchases due to the expectation for lower prices phosphate segment sales volume of 1857000 tons in 2013 was 9 lower than 2012 due primarily to reduced

primary uses of cash are for operating costs working capital capital expenditures debt service investments taxes share repurchases and dividends our working capital requirements are affected by several factors including demand for our products selling prices raw material costs freight and storage costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business generally our primary source of cash is cash from operations which includes cash generated by customer advances we may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreement   during 2013 the following significant events have had or will have an impact on our cash and liquidity position    under our current boardauthorized 30 billion share purchase program we repurchased 73 million common shares in 2013 for a total cost of 14 billion  through the end of 2013 we made 07 billion of capital expenditures related to our 38 billion capacity expansion projects these projects are expected to be onstream by 2016 during 2014 we expect to spend approximately 20 billion on these projects  in april 2013 we completed the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in cfl for 09 billion   in october 2013 we entered into a set of strategic agreements with mosaic including a definitive agreement to sell the entirety of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement plus two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic we expect the phosphate business sale transaction will close in the first half of 2014  in april 2013 we amended and restated our credit agreement increasing the revolving credit facility by 05 billion to 10 billion and extending the maturity date to may 2018  in may 2013 we issued 15 billion in senior notes with 750 million due in 2023 and 750 million due in 2043  in december 2013 we announced our intent to raise up to 15 billion

original maturities of three months or less under our shortterm investment policy we may invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the us and canadian federal governments those issued by state local or other governmental entities and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities   share repurchase programs   in the third quarter of 2011 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 15 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2013 during 2011 we repurchased 65 million shares under the program for 10 billion and in the second quarter of 2012 we repurchased 31 million shares of cf holdings common stock for 5000 million thereby completing this program in june 2012 all 96 million shares that had been repurchased under this program were retired in our consolidated balance sheet the retirement of these shares eliminated the recorded treasury stock and reduced retained earnings and paidin capital by 11259 million and 3742 million respectively as of june 30 2012   in the third quarter of 2012 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 30 billion of cf holdings common stock through december 31 2016 repurchases under this program may be made from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise the manner timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by our management based on evaluation of market conditions stock price and other factors in 2013 we repurchased 73 million shares for 14 billion there were no repurchases under this program in 2012 in 2013 we retired 64 million shares of our stock repurchased during the year in our consolidated balance sheet the retirement of these shares eliminated the recorded treasury stock and reduced retained earnings and paidin capital by 10674 million and 1804 million respectively   capacity expansion projects and restricted cash   in november 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized expenditures of 38 billion to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections and power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable cost advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through available cash and securities cash generated from operations and borrowings total cash spent to date on capital expenditures for the expansion projects was 4769 million including 3561 million spent during 2013 in addition 2036 million was invested in the expansion project and not paid at december 31 2013 and recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in the lines labeled accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities  60      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   we have retained engineering and procurement services from an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde uhde for both the donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa expansion projects under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we have granted uhde a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects the amount in the account will change over time based on procurement costs the amount is projected to reach approximately 375 million at certain points in time during construction and will be zero by the end of the project at december 31 2013 there was 1540 million held in this account this restricted cash is not included in our cash and cash equivalents and is reported separately on our consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows   capital spending   we make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base to increase our capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements capital expenditures totaled 8238 million in 2013 as compared to 5235 million in 2012 the increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of the 3561 million spent on the two capacity expansion projects discussed above   projected capital spending   we expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately 25 billion including 20 billion for the capacity expansion projects and 05 billion of sustaining and other capital expenditures planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties   acquisitions of the noncontrolling interests in canadian fertilizers limited   in 2012 we entered into agreements to acquire the 34 of cfls common and preferred shares owned by viterra the product purchase agreement between cfl and viterra and the cfl common shares held by growmark and la coop fédérée for a total purchase price of approximately c09 billion in april 2013 we completed the acquisitions since cfl was previously a consolidated variable interest entity the purchase price was recognized as follows a 08 billion reduction in paid in capital a 01 billion deferred tax asset and the removal of the cfl noncontrolling interest cfl is now a wholly owned subsidiary and we are entitled to purchase 100 of cfls ammonia and granular urea production for additional information see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report   planned disposition of phosphate business and ammonia supply agreements   in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the first agreement which is not conditioned upon completion of the phosphate business sale transaction provides for us to supply between 600000 and 800000 tons of ammonia per year from our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex beginning no later than 2017 the second agreement provides for us to supply approximately 300000 tons of ammonia per year sourced from our point lisas nitrogen limited plnl joint venture beginning at the closing of the phosphate business sale transaction see further discussion of this transaction in the section titled items affecting comparability of results and in note 12assets and liabilities held for sale to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report  61                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes   we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basis   at december 31 2013 approximately 2823 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 17 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states at december 31 2013 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 141 million   debt   we intend to raise up to 15 billion in longterm debt in 2014 this new debt in addition to cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business will fund our capital expenditure programs dividends to shareholders working capital and additional share repurchases   credit agreement   on april 22 2013 we amended and restated the cf

warranties covenants and events of default including requirements that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio as well as other customary covenants and events of default our senior notes indentures also include certain covenants and events of default as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the senior notes indentures  62      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   senior notes   at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had 31 billion and 16 billion of senior notes outstanding respectively with maturities ranging from 2018 through 2043 as follows   senior notes due 2018 and 2020   on april 23 2010 cf industries issued 800 million aggregate principal amount of

the 20182020 notes are guaranteed by cf holdings in addition in the event that a subsidiary of ours other than cf industries becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the credit agreement or any renewal replacement or refinancing thereof such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the 20182020 notes   senior notes due 2023 and 2043   on may 23 2013 cf industries issued 750 million

1 and december 1 and the 20232043 notes are redeemable at our option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at specified makewhole redemption prices we received net proceeds of approximately 148 billion from the issuance and sale of the 20232043 notes after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses   under the supplemental indentures governing the 20232043 notes the 20232043 notes are guaranteed by cf holdings in addition in the event that a subsidiary of ours other than cf industries becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the credit agreement or any renewal replacement or refinancing thereof such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the 20232043 notes provided that such requirement will no longer apply following the repayment of both issues of the 20182020 notes or the subsidiaries of ours other than cf industries otherwise become no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the 20182020 notes   forward sales and customer advances   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives additionally our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis  63      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 1206 million and 3807 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets   while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances could likely increase also borrowing under our credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity   under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales   derivative financial instruments   we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions and in most cases the use of master netting arrangements   the master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features with slidingscale credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the ratings assigned to our longterm unsecured debt by certain credit rating agencies downgrades in our credit ratings could cause the applicable threshold levels to increase if our net liability positions with the counterparties exceed the threshold amounts those counterparties could require cash collateral some other form of credit support or daily cash settlement of unrealized losses   as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 02 million and 09 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2013 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 6363 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts   financial assurance requirements   in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance obligations related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and  64      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex these financial assurance obligations result from two requirements the first is a 2010 consent decree with the epa and the fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city complex the plant city consent decree the second is state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance that apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we maintain a trust account for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheets these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds and at december 31 2013 these assets were recorded as assets held for sale the trust for the plant city consent decree is fully funded and we expect the remaining 10 million will be funded in the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding would be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts in the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida as a result the asset retirement obligation funds are included in noncurrent assets held for sale at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 and 2012 the balance in the aro funds was 2037 million and 2008 million respectively   the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems   florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods   other liquidity requirements   we contributed 70 million to our pension plans in 2013 we expect to contribute approximately 212 million to our pension plans in 2014  65      table

was 15 billion as compared to 24 billion in 2012 the 09 billion decline was due to the combination of a 3906 million decline in net earnings and a higher level of net working capital invested in the business in 2013 versus 2012 during 2013 7402 million more was invested in net working capital than in 2012 due primarily to higher income tax payments and lower customer advances as customers delayed

at the end of 2012 as compared to the end of 2011 as lower inventory lower receivables and higher customer advances and accounts payable and accrued expenses contributed to the lower levels of working

commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional

in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources   critical accounting policies and estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales  69                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews   scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment   inventory valuation   we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales   asset retirement obligations aros   asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value when initially recognized the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset in subsequent periods depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded for additional information see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report  70      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our most significant aros are driven by regulations in florida governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in hardee county florida other aros consist of conditional aros for the plant city bartow and hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date these aros relate to cessation of operations and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials asbestos equipment vessels piping and storage tanks   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2013 dollars is 530 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2013 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion   recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review   the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately   we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test  71      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2013 or 2012 reviews as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying value of our goodwill was 21 billion   derivative financial instruments   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur   certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our major capacity expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting   income taxes   we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively  72      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods   pension assets and liabilities   pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7686 million at december 31 2013 which was 679 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2013 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 48 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 490 million higher or 445 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed   the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2013 was 40 if the discount rate used to compute 2013 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 49 million higher or 38 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 51 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2013 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2013 would have been 32 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

method to account for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies plus the amortization expense of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of purchase accounting our judgment

included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements   discussion of seasonality impacts on operations   our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns
