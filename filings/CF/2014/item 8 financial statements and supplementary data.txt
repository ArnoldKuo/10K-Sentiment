one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in north america at one million tons per year its phosphoric acid capacity represents approximately 10 of the total us capacity all of plant citys phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates dap and map representing approximately 13 of us capacity for ammonium phosphate fertilizer products in 2013 the combination of the plant city phosphate fertilizer complex and the hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in north america   bartow phosphate complex   we own a site in bartow florida on which we operated a phosphate manufacturing complex this complex ceased production in 1999 and the former manufacturing facilities have been dismantled and disposed of in accordance with local laws and regulations the related phosphogypsum stack has been closed and the former storage and distribution facilities were sold along with excess land we continue to be obligated for the closure of the cooling pond management of water treatment on the site and providing longterm care for the site in accordance with regulatory requirements   phosphate raw materials   phosphate rock supply phosphate rock is the basic nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers approximately 35 tons of phosphate rock are needed to produce one ton of p2o5 the measure of nutrient content of phosphate fertilizers our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex typically consumes in excess of three million tons of rock annually as of december 31 2013 our hardee rock mine had approximately 11 years of fully permitted recoverable phosphate reserves remaining at current operating rates we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our hardee property where we can mine the expanded area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves we estimate that we will be able to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area   sulfur supply sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid approximately three quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of p2o5 our plant city phosphate fertilizer complex uses approximately 800000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at capacity we obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers under contracts of varied duration in 2013 martin

occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing

november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the federal district court court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious   subsequently the florida department of environmental protection fdep adopted its own nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for surface waters and related implementation standards on november

to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatility   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizers   the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 308 per mmbtu on january 11 2013 and a high of 452 per mmbtu on december 24 2013 during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012   changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   north american prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of production from shale gas formations future production of natural gas from shale gas formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost for other reasons if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected   historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade   periods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacity   during periods of industry oversupply our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production  18      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers   we are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities   some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships   china the worlds largest producer and consumer of fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capability if chinese government policy or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   russia and ukraine have significant capacity to produce and export nitrogen fertilizers and producers in these countries continue to pay belowmarket prices for natural gas due to ongoing government intervention in natural gas pricing competition in the united states with imports of solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine is currently subject to the discipline imposed by us antidumping duty orders which require such imports to be priced at or above fair value when sold in the us market the antidumping orders have affected the pricing of these imports and have also restrained the volumes imported however if there were to be significant decreases in the antidumping duty rates applied to most russian and ukrainian exporters we could face much higher volumes of lower priced russian and ukrainian urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in the united states the russian and ukrainian solid urea antidumping orders are expected to remain in place until at least december

2018   a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our products   conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control   state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand in part due to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels this increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics  19      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  while the current renewable fuels standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to allow increased ethanol imports and to eliminate the fuel mandate either of which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in november 2013 the epa proposed to reduce the renewable fuels volumes required for calendar year 2014 to around current consumption levels developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have

materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products   our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses   our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these  20      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities   we maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage   in april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility we have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in 2013 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our product to west fertilizer co products we have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident based on the initial analysis of the pending lawsuits we believe that we have strong legal and factual defenses to the claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in the pending lawsuits and any other claims brought against us in connection with the incident in addition the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities   cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results   as we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems among other things to manage our accounting manufacturing supply chain and financial functions this risk not only applies to us but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft loss damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks compromises to our information systems could have severe financial and other business implications  21      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations   weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our products   adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns   weather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen based fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use in addition hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise   we may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on schedule as planned on budget or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control   on november 1 2012 we announced that we will construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our complex in donaldsonville louisiana and new ammonia and urea units at our complex in port neal iowa our board of directors has authorized expenditures of 38 billion for the projects total invested on these projects through december 31 2013 was 6805 million   the design development construction and startup of the new plants are subject to a number of risks any of which could prevent us from completing the projects on schedule as planned and on budget or at all including cost overruns performance of third parties permitting matters adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor and raw material shortages transportation constraints engineering and construction change orders and other unforeseen difficulties   the donaldsonville and port neal expansion projects are dependent on the availability and performance of the engineering firms construction firms equipment suppliers transportation providers and other vendors necessary to build the new units on a timely basis and on acceptable economic terms if any of the third parties fails to perform as we expect our ability to meet our expansion goals would be affected   our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences such as the diversion of managements attention from our existing plants and businesses and other opportunities   other expansions of our business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences   we routinely consider possible expansions of our business both domestically and in foreign locations major investments in our business including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments require significant managerial resources which may be diverted from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize  22      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or other major investments   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws regulations and permitting requirements as well as potential environmental liabilities which may require us to make substantial expenditures   we are subject to numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the united states canada the united kingdom and the republic of trinidad and tobago including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of hazardous substance releases the discharge of regulated substances to air or water and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure in the united states these laws include the clean air act the clean water act rcra cercla the toxic substances control act and various other federal state provincial local and international statutes   as a fertilizer company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances our business is inherently subject to spills discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment certain environmental laws including cercla impose joint and several liability without regard to fault for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment given the nature of our business we have incurred are incurring currently and are likely to incur periodically in the future liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws at our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations the costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material additionally we may become liable to third parties for damages including personal injury and property damage resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment   violations of environmental and health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties court orders to install pollutioncontrol equipment civil and criminal sanctions permit revocations and facility shutdowns environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have tended to become more stringent over time as a result we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations additionally future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures additionally our costs to comply with or any liabilities under these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   from time to time our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses   our operations are dependent on numerous required permits approvals and meeting financial assurance requirements from governmental authorities   we hold numerous environmental mining and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities expansion of our operations is dependent upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an  23      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   in certain cases as a condition to procure such permits and approvals or as a condition to maintain existing approvals we may be required to comply with regulatory financial assurance requirements the purpose of these requirements is to assure local state or federal government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities for example we have funded an escrow account for the benefit of the florida department of environmental protection fdep as a means of complying with floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to closure and postclosure of phosphogypsum stacks also pursuant to a consent decree with the us epa and the fdep we have funded a trust as a means of complying with similar requirements for closure post closure and monitoring of the phosphogypsum stack system at our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex   florida regulations also mandate payment of certain mining taxes based on the quantity of ore mined and are subject to change based on local regulatory approvals additional financial assurance requirements or other increases in local mining regulations and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   florida regulations also require phosphate rock mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted we will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities the demonstration of financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to expend funds for the purchase of bonds letters of credit insurance policies or similar instruments it is possible that we will not be able to comply with either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   as of december 31 2013 the area permitted by local state and federal authorities for mining at our hardee phosphate complex contained approximately 385 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves which will meet our requirements at current operating rates for approximately 11 years we have initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our hardee property the expanded geographical area has an estimated 353 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves which will allow us to conduct mining operations at our hardee property for approximately 10 additional years at current operating rates assuming we secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area in florida local community participation has become an important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies a denial of the authorizations or permits to continue or expand our mining operations at our hardee property would prevent us from mining all of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we have secured the state environmental authorization to increase the capacity of our phosphogypsum stack system at plant city the phase ii expansion project was completed in july 2013 and will provide sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2026 at current operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits including further expansion phases the estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing the corresponding construction and operating permits this time frame is approximately five years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our  24      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  hardee mine a decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have significant impacts on the fertilizer industry due to the fact that our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us   our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality   the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season   if seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer business because of the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns causing an adverse change in operating results   a change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose this improves our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allows us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing assets  25      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date thereby significantly increasing our liquidity any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders equaled approximately 7 and 17 respectively of our cash and cash equivalents   we believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment   we also sell phosphate products on a forward basis in 2013 forward sales of phosphate fertilizer products represented approximately 14 of our phosphate fertilizer volume unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products where we have the opportunity to fix or cap the cost of natural gas we typically are unable to do the same for the cost of phosphate raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia which are among the largest components of our phosphate fertilizer costs as a result we are typically exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis   our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses   we manage the risk of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates using derivative instruments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes involving commodity price volatility adverse correlation of commodity prices or market liquidity issues   in order to manage financial exposure to commodity price and market fluctuations we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen based fertilizers we have used fixedprice forward physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist   our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or for which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties thereby negatively impacting our liquidity   in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large  26      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  financial institutions we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties established credit limits cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on derivative settlements   we are reliant on a limited number of key facilities   our nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of the companys ammonia production capacity our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in hardee county florida our phosphate fertilizer complex in plant city florida and our ammonia terminal in tampa florida the suspension of operations at any of these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition a number of our key facilities including the donaldsonville complex and all of our phosphate operations are located in regions of the united states that experience a relatively high level of hurricane activity such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the gulf of mexico region   we are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventures   we participate in joint ventures including point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business   in addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs   acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business   like other companies with major industrial facilities our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets of terrorist activities many of these plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  27      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   in addition due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives local state federal and foreign governments could implement new regulations impacting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the us or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that such illicit use of our products could result in liability for the company   our operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and an increase in the price or any delay or interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our business   we and our joint ventures use natural gas ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase these raw materials from thirdparty suppliers prices for these raw materials can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand we may not be able to pass along to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business these products are transported by barge truck rail or pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by thirdparty transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw materials including those caused by capacity constraints explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving pipelines deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled downtime or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to risks associated with international operations   our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions during 2013 we derived approximately 18 of our net sales from outside of the united states our business operations include our nitrogen fertilizer complex in medicine hat alberta our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in courtright ontario a 50 interest in an ammonia production joint venture in trinidad a 50 interest in a uk joint venture for the production of anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products and a 50 interest in a fertilizer trading operation headquartered near zurich switzerland   our investments in securities are subject to risks that may result in losses   our cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 17 billion as of december 31 2013 we generally invest these cash and cash equivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and money market funds securities issued by

investments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   a slowdown of or persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted   in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment   we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our operations   as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 31 billion of total indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2043 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately 9951 million the terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future our existing indebtedness and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have negative consequences on our business should operating cash flows be insufficient to cover debt service which would adversely affect our operations and liquidity   from time to time we consider our options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   the loss of key members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our business   we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional staff the loss of one or more key personnel could have a material  29      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  adverse effect on our results of operations additionally if we are unable to find hire and retain needed key personnel in the future our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected   we are subject to risk associated with the strategic agreements that we entered into with the mosaic company including the risk that we may not be able to complete the sale of our phosphate business to the mosaic company as planned or at all due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control   in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with the mosaic company mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the first agreement which is not conditioned upon completion of the phosphate business sale transaction provides for us to supply between 600000 and 800000 tons of ammonia per year from our donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex

industries and viterras purchases of nitrogen fertilizer products from cfl were made under product purchase agreements and the selling prices were determined under the provisions of these agreements an initial selling price was paid to cfl based upon cfls production cost plus an agreedupon margin once title passed as the product was shipped at the end of the year the difference between the market price of products purchased from cfl and the price based on production cost plus an agreedupon margin was paid to cfl the sales revenue attributable to this difference was accrued by the company on an interim basis until april 30 2013 when cfl became a wholly owned subsidiary in our financial statements net sales and accounts receivable attributable to cfl were solely generated by transactions with viterra as all transactions with cf industries were eliminated in consolidation in our financial statements   in the fourth quarter of 2012 the cfl board of directors approved amendments to the product purchase agreements retroactive to january 1 2012 that modified the selling prices that cfl charged for products sold to viterra and cf industries which eliminated the requirement to pay to

prepared in accordance with gaap   net operating loss nol settlement   at the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved at december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowance   in january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to them   in march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we have agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as follows   nol tax benefits of 758 million were recognized which reduced income tax expense   a charge of 552 million was recognized for the 731 portion of the nol benefit that will be paid to the preipo owners as the tax benefits are realized the 552 million charge is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other nonoperatingnet    financial executive summary    during 2013 we experienced lower net sales and net earnings as compared to the prior year due to weakness in the global fertilizer markets the lower earnings were due primarily to lower selling prices for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and higher natural gas costs as compared to the prior year the decline in global nitrogen selling prices was attributable to increased supply due primarily to higher exports from china the decline in phosphate selling prices reflected weaker demand from india   in 2013 we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of 15 billion compared to net earnings of 18 billion in 2012 or a decline of 21 our 2013 results included 529 million of pretax unrealized marktomarket gains 335 million after tax on natural gas derivatives and 208 million of realized and unrealized net gains 132 million after tax on foreign currency derivatives related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa and a net 206 million benefit from a settlement with the irs concerning certain preipo nols   42      table of contents  cf industries

loan fees on our 2010 credit agreement that we replaced in may 2012 and a 109 million pretax curtailment gain 68 million after tax from a reduction in certain retiree medical benefits  diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 13 to 2474 in 2013 from 2859 for 2012 due to lower earnings partially offset by a lower average number of outstanding common shares due to our share repurchase program  our gross margin declined by 5931 million or 19 to 25 billion in 2013 from 31 billion in 2012 due to lower nitrogen and phosphate segment earnings as a result of lower average selling prices and lower phosphate sales volume in the nitrogen segment gross margin decreased by 4683 million or 16 due primarily to lower average selling prices in the phosphate segment gross margin decreased 1248 million or 62 due to declines in both average selling prices and volume  our net sales decreased 6293 million or 10 in 2013 compared to 2012 in the nitrogen segment net sales decreased by 8 due primarily to an 8 reduction in average selling prices in the phosphate segment net sales declined by 21 due to a 13 decline in average selling prices and a 9 decline in sales volume  net cash generated from operating activities during 2013 was 15 billion as compared to 24 billion in 2012 the 09 billion decline was due to the combination of lower net earnings and higher net working capital levels due primarily to lower accrued income taxes and lower customer advances as customers delayed purchasing decisions in 2013 as compared to the prior year  cash used in investing activities increased by 5058 million in 2013 to 10193 million as compared to 5135 million in the prior year the increase was due primarily to a 3003 million increase in capital expenditures and a 1540 million deposit into a restricted cash account both primarily related to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa  in october 2013 we entered into a set of strategic agreements with mosaic the agreements include a definitive agreement to sell the entirety of cf industries phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida to mosaic for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement and agreements under which the company will supply mosaic with ammonia from its donaldsonville louisiana nitrogen complex and the companys point lisas nitrogen ltd plnl joint venture  during 2013 we repurchased 73 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 19743 representing 12 of the prior year end outstanding shares at a cost of 14 billion    key industry factors   we operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined below  43      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   global supply amp demand   historically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key consumingexporting countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global trade   natural gas prices   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and an because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2013 the average daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 492 per mmbtu on june 9 2011 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 natural gas costs rose 8 in 2013 from 2012 expenditures on natural gas including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 41 of the total cost of sales for our nitrogen fertilizer products in 2013 up from 39 in 2012 natural gas costs represented a higher percentage of cash production costs total production costs less depreciation and amortization   farmers economics   the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns and the types of crops planted   global trade in fertilizer   in addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world  44      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa and china are major exporters to north america   the domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of dapmap consequently phosphate fertilizer prices and demand for us dapmap are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market including fertilizer and trade policies of foreign governments changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations   political and social government policies   the political and social policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives   factors affecting our results   net sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales   cost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost we report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivatives   selling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives  45      table of

selling prices decreased to 361 per ton in 2013 from 393 per ton in 2012 including declines of 16 for urea 6 for an and 2 for both ammonia and uan as compared to the prior year the decline in urea prices versus the prior year was primarily due to increased supply as a result of higher urea exports from chinese producers during the low tariff export season the decline in ammonia prices versus the prior year was due to the combination of a weaker nitrogen pricing environment higher domestic production rates and inventory levels and reduced demand associated with unfavorable weather conditions during 2013 the cold and wet spring and the shortened fall application season reduced ammonia demand compared to the favorable application environment during 2012 the decline in uan prices versus the prior year was due primarily to higher global supply of nitrogen products   cost of sales cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged 172 per ton in 2013 compared to 168 per ton in 2012 this 2 increase was due primarily to an 8 increase in the realized cost of natural gas and a 136 million reduction in net unrealized marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in the current year

prices increased to 393 per ton in 2012 from 385 per ton in 2011 with increases in ammonia and urea higher ammonia and urea average selling prices resulted from tight industrywide supply conditions due to increased us demand caused by the higher level of planted acres in 2012 and expected in 2013 and lower downstream inventories sales volume in 2012 approximated the level in 2011 as higher sales of ammonia and other nitrogen products were offset by lower sales volumes of uan and ammonium nitrate a favorable application environment for ammonia during 2012 supported the higher sales volume for this product the lower sales volumes of uan and ammonia nitrate were due to scheduled plant turnarounds and maintenance activities during 2012 that resulted in lower production of these products lower uan sales volume was also due to a shift in product mix favoring higher margin nitrogen products during the year   cost of sales total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment averaged approximately 168 per ton in 2012 compared to 188 per ton in 2011 the 11 decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs and 665 million in unrealized net marktomarket gains on natural gas derivatives in

to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex in combination these two new facilities will be able to produce 21 million tons of gross ammonia per year and upgraded products ranging from 20 to 27 million tons of granular urea per year and up to 18 million tons of uan 32 solution per year depending on our choice of product mix the 38 billion cost estimate includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections and power supply and product storage and handling systems these plants will increase our product mix flexibility at donaldsonville improve our ability to serve uppermidwest urea customers from our port neal location and allow us to benefit from the favorable cost advantage of north american natural gas all of these new facilities are scheduled to be onstream by 2016 we expect to finance the capital expenditures through available cash and securities cash generated from operations and borrowings total cash spent to date on capital expenditures for the expansion projects was 4769 million including 3561 million spent during 2013 in addition 2036 million was invested in the expansion project and not paid at december 31 2013 and recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in the lines labeled

we have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in

advances   we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers as a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives additionally our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment unlike nitrogen fertilizer products sold under forward sales contracts we typically are unable to use hedges to reduce our exposure to raw material price changes for components of our phosphate manufacturing cost the largest of which are sulfur and ammonia as a result we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis  63      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 1206 million and 3807 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets   while customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances could likely increase also borrowing under our credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity   under our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales   derivative financial instruments   we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions and in most cases the use of master netting arrangements   the master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features with slidingscale credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the ratings assigned to our longterm unsecured debt by certain credit rating agencies downgrades in our credit ratings could cause the applicable threshold levels to increase if our net liability positions with the counterparties exceed the threshold amounts those counterparties could require cash collateral some other form of credit support or daily cash settlement of unrealized losses   as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 02 million and 09 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2013 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 6363 million at december

phosphate fertilizer complex and  64      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex these financial assurance obligations result from two requirements the first is a 2010 consent decree with the epa and the fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city complex the plant city consent decree the second is state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance that apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we maintain a trust account for the benefit of the epa and the fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheets these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds and at december 31 2013 these assets were recorded as assets held for sale the trust for the plant city consent decree is fully funded and we expect the remaining 10 million will be funded in the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding would be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts in the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida as a result the asset retirement obligation funds are included in noncurrent assets held for sale at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 and 2012 the balance in the aro funds was 2037 million and 2008 million respectively   the amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack systems closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the trust and escrow accounts which are based on the guidelines set forth in the plant city consent decree and florida financial assurance regulations ultimately the funds in these accounts will be used to fund the closure and maintenance of the phosphogypsum stack systems   florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities we will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures if and when we are able to expand our hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted the demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a trust fund agreement or escrow account based on these current regulations we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in florida utilizing any of these methods   other liquidity requirements   we contributed 70 million to our pension plans in 2013 we expect to contribute approximately 212 million to our pension plans in 2014  65      table

financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales  69                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc    property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation depletion and amortization is computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews   scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher production costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipment   inventory valuation   we review our inventory balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales   asset retirement obligations aros   asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value when initially recognized the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset in subsequent periods depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded for additional information see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report  70      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   our most significant aros are driven by regulations in florida governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in hardee county florida other aros consist of conditional aros for the plant city bartow and hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date these aros relate to cessation of operations and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials asbestos equipment vessels piping and storage tanks   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2013 dollars is 530 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2013 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion   recoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review   the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediately   we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test  71      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2013 or 2012 reviews as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying value of our goodwill was 21 billion   derivative financial instruments   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur   certain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our major capacity expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting   income taxes   we recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occur   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively  72      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   as a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periods   pension assets and liabilities   pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7686 million at december 31 2013 which was 679 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2013 pbo was computed based on a weighted average discount rate of 48 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 490 million higher or 445 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed   the weighted average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2013 was 40 if the discount rate used to compute 2013 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 49 million higher or 38 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 51 weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2013 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2013 would have been 32 million lower or higher respectively see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements

status   we eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions   recent accounting pronouncements   see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements   discussion of seasonality impacts on operations   our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns       item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    we are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices the valuation of our investments interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates   commodity prices   our net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to fertilizer sales are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea and uan 32 by approximately 32 22 and 14 respectively   natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivative instruments that we use currently are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and call options these derivatives settle using nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods   at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had open derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and 589 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at december 31 2013 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 603 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 603 million   we purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of dap and map there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered through increases in selling prices we enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and  74      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  sulfur at market prices a 10 per ton change in the related cost of a short ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change dap production cost by 218 per ton and 382 per ton respectively we also may from time to time purchase ammonia granular urea uan dap and map to augment or replace production at our facilities   interest rate fluctuations   at december 31 2013 we had four series of senior notes totaling 31 billion outstanding with maturity dates of may 1 2018 may 1 2020 june 1 2023 and june 1 2043 the senior notes have fixed interest rates the fair value of our senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 was approximately 33 billion borrowings under our credit agreement bear a current market rate of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings however in 2013 there were no borrowings under that agreement   foreign currency exchange rates   we have entered into eurous dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the euro denominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville and port neal facilities at december 31 2013 the notional amount of our open foreign currency forward contracts was approximately 6363 million and the fair value was a net unrealized gain of 289 million a 10 change in usdeuro forward exchange rates would change the fair value of these positions by 636 million   we are also directly exposed to changes in the value of the canadian dollar the british pound and the swiss franc we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies  75                 table of contents       cf industries holdings inc        item 8 financial statements and supplementary data        report of independent registered

recognition   the basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are 1 evidence that a sales arrangement exists 2 delivery of goods has occurred 3 the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured we recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales when title transfers to the customer regardless of when the customer advances are received   we offer certain incentives that typically involve rebates if a customer reaches a specified level of purchases incentives are accrued monthly and reported as a reduction in net sales this process is intended to report sales at the ultimate net realized price and requires the use of estimates  83      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc

other comprehensive income unless fair value is below amortized cost ie the investment is impaired and the impairment is deemed otherthantemporary in which case some or all of the decline in value would be charged to earnings the carrying values of shortterm investments approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments   we also maintain a

for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence profits resulting from sales or purchases with equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investee or investor respectively losses in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate which are other than temporary are recognized when the current fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates is included in the other segment in our segment disclosures   our equity method investments for which the results are included in operating earnings consist of 1 50 ownership interest in plnl which operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago and 2 50 interest in an ammonia storage joint venture located in houston texas our share of the net earnings from these investments is reported as an element of earnings from operations because these operations provide additional production and storage capacity to our operations and are integrated with our supply chain and sales activities in the nitrogen segment   our nonoperating equity method investments consist of 1 50 ownership in keytrade a fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland and 2 a 50 ownership in growhow which operates nitrogen production facilities in

operations integrated within our supply chain advances to unconsolidated affiliates are loans made to keytrade and are classified as heldtomaturity debt securities and are reported at amortized cost   property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are stated at cost depreciation depletion and amortization are computed using the unitsofproduction method or the straightline method

overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at the companys continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years if the direct expense method were used all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as

recoverability of longlived assets   we review property plant and equipment and other longlived assets in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset   assets and liabilities held for sale   assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use we classify assets and liabilities we will sell disposal group as held for sale in the period in which all of following criteria are met 1 management with the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell 2 the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary 3 we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer 4 the sale is probable 5 the transfer is expected to qualify as a completed sale within one year of such classification there are some circumstances beyond the entitys control that may extend the time for completion beyond one year and 5 we are actively marketing the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value once classified as held for sale capitalized amounts including those for property plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized   in the consolidated statements of operations an entity must report the results of operating a component it has classified as held for sale as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations if the components operations and cash flows will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the components operations after the disposal results of operating a component held for sale but not qualifying as a discontinued operation are included in continuing operations and not reported separately   in october 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with mosaic to sell our entire phosphate mining and manufacturing business which is located in florida for a purchase price of approximately 14 billion in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement and entered into two agreements to supply ammonia to mosaic the assets and liabilities of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business being sold to mosaic comprise a disposal group that is classified on our december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities held for sale the contract to supply ammonia to the disposed business from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation following the sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business of a supply arrangement that historically has been maintained between the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company and its subsidiaries because of the significance of this continuing supply arrangement in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations   goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level which in our case are the nitrogen and phosphate segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment  86      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an income based valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value   intangible assets identified with our acquisition of terra consist of customer relationships and trademarks which are being amortized over amortization periods of 18 years and 10 years respectively our intangible assets are presented in noncurrent other assets on the consolidated balance sheet   leases   leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated on the same basis as property plant and equipment rental payments including rent holidays leasehold incentives and scheduled rent increases are expensed on a straightline basis leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term including any applicable renewals   income taxes   income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectively   a deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the companys nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is considered to not be permanently reinvested no deferred income taxes have been recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvested   derivative financial instruments   natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments currently used are fixed price swaps and options traded in the overthecounter markets the derivatives reference primarily nymex futures contract prices which represent the basis for fair value at any given time these derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts  87      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   the accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occur changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings at december 31 2013 the company elected to dedesignate the remaining cash flow hedging instruments   derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as current or noncurrent assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet the fair values of derivative instruments and any related cash collateral are reported on a gross basis rather than on a net basis   cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities cash flows related to foreign currency derivatives are reported as investing activities since they hedge future payments for the construction of long term assets   we do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives for additional information see note 24derivative financial instruments   asset retirement obligations   asset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value when initially recognized the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset in subsequent periods depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded for additional information see note 10asset retirement obligations   our most significant aros are driven by regulations in florida governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and site reclamation for the phosphate rock mine in hardee county florida other aros consist of conditional aros for the plant city bartow and hardee facilities for which a reasonable basis exists for estimating a settlement date these aros relate to cessation of operations and generally include the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials asbestos equipment vessels piping and storage tanks   we also have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and closure of effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value   customer advances   customer advances represent cash received from customers following acceptance of orders under the companys forward sales programs such advances typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value and are generally collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating accounts receivable from customers upon shipment revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers  88

an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety or efficiency of the operations or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized liabilities are recorded when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated environmental liabilities are not discounted   stockbased compensation   we grant stockbased compensation awards under the cf industries holdings inc 2009 equity and incentive plan the awards that have been granted to date are nonqualified stock options and restricted stock the cost of employee services received in exchange for the awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the

regarding public utility and transportation rates environmental matters taxes and permits relating to the operations of its various plants and facilities accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters many factors are considered these factors include but are not limited to past history scientific and other evidence and the specifics and status of each matter if the assessment of various factors changes the estimates may change predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals   foreign currency translation   foreign currencydenominated assets

our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us and canadian government obligations and money market mutual funds that invest in us government obligations and other investmentgrade securities cash equivalents approximates fair value because of their shortterm maturities   restricted cash   we have contracted for engineering and procurement services with an affiliate of thyssenkrupp uhde uhde for our capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa production facilities under the terms of the engineering and procurement services contract we are required to grant uhde a security interest in a restricted cash account and maintain a cash balance in that account equal to the cancellation fees for procurement services and equipment that would arise if we were to cancel the projects we began funding the restricted account in the second quarter of 2013 the balance in the account is expected to change over time based on the amounts of unpaid engineering and procurement costs   derivative instruments   the derivative instruments that we currently use are fixed price natural gas swaps and options and foreign currency forward contracts traded in the overthecounter markets with either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions the natural gas derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods the foreign currency derivative contracts held are for the exchange of a specified notional amount of currencies at specified future dates coinciding with anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capital expansion projects the natural gas contracts settle using nymex

florida are subject to regulations governing the construction operation closure and longterm maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and regulations concerning site reclamation for phosphate rock mines our liability for phosphogypsum stack system costs includes the cost of stack closure at plant city and the costs of cooling pond closure postclosure monitoring and ongoing water treatment at both bartow and plant city the actual amounts to be spent will depend on factors such as the timing of activities refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation and changes in regulations it is possible that these factors could change at any time and impact the estimates closure expenditures for the bartow cooling pond are estimated to occur through 2016 closure expenditures for the plant city stack expansion are estimated to occur in the 2038 to 2042 time frame and closure of the plant city cooling pond is assumed to occur in the year 2092 additional aros may be incurred in the future   the liability for mine reclamation costs is primarily for work involving the recontouring revegetation and reestablishment of wildlife habitat and hydrology of land disturbed by phosphate rock mining activities in accordance with regulations in florida physical reclamation and restoration of disturbed areas is generally required to be completed within a prescribed time frame after completion of mining operations and the timing of reconnection to surrounding lands and waterways varies based on achievement of applicable release criteria the actual time required to complete the work may vary depending on sitespecific reclamation plans and other circumstances   the 60 million change in estimate in 2011 relates primarily to changes in the scope of closure activities of our bartow phosphogypsum stack system and mine reclamation activities at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine of this amount 66 million was charged to earnings and an offsetting 06 million was recorded as a decrease in property plant and equipment   the 36 million change in estimate in 2012 relates primarily to changes in mining and reclamation plans at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine of this amount 65 million was recorded  105      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc  as a decrease in property plant and equipment and 29 million was charged to cost of sales the 134 million liability incurred in 2012 relates primarily to the expansion of our phosphogysum stack at the plant city florida phosphate facility this expansion will allow us to continue to operate the plant city facility through the life of our current phosphate rock reserves   the 130 million change in estimate in 2013 relates primarily to changes in mining and reclamation plans at our hardee county florida phosphate rock mine and changes in the timing of closure activities at the plant city florida phosphate facility of this amount 146 million was recorded as an increase in property plant and equipment partially offset by a 16 million decrease to cost of sales   in addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment we are also subject to financial assurance obligations related to the closure and maintenance of our phosphogypsum stack systems at both our plant city florida phosphate fertilizer complex and our closed bartow florida phosphate fertilizer complex these financial assurance obligations result from two requirements the first is a 2010 consent decree with the epa and the fdep with respect to our compliance with the resource conservation and recovery act rcra at our plant city complex the plant city consent decree the second is state of florida financial assurance regulations florida financial assurance that apply to both our plant city and bartow complexes both of these regulations allow the use of a funding mechanism as a means of complying with the financial assurance requirements associated with the closure longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stacks as well as costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure we maintain a trust account for the benefit of the epa and fdep and an escrow account for the benefit of the fdep to meet these financial assurance requirements on our consolidated balance sheets these are collectively referred to as asset retirement obligation funds aro funds and at december 31 2013 these assets were recorded as assets held for sale the trust for the plant city consent decree is fully funded and we expect the remaining 10 million will be funded in the state of florida financial assurance escrow account near the end of 2015 both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding would be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed investment earnings in the trust or escrow accounts at december 31 2013 and 2012 the balance in the aro funds was 2037 million and 2008 million respectively   prior to the plant city consent decree the companys financial assurance requirements for the closure water treatment longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the plant city phosphogypsum stack system were determined solely by florida regulations that would have required funding of the escrow account over a period of years the plant city consent decree described above effectively requires the company to fund the greater of the requirements under the plant city consent decree or florida law which may vary over time we are still required under florida law to maintain the existing florida escrow account for the closure water treatment longterm maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system at our closed bartow phosphate complex  106                table of contents   cf industries holdings inc   we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included is reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2013 dollars is 530 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros at december 31 2013 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion  11

risk management   natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods of generally less than 18 months the derivatives that we use are primarily fixed price swaps and call options traded in the overthecounter otc markets these natural gas derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts are entered into with respect to gas to be consumed in the future and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting   as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 763 million mmbtus and 589 million mmbtus respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 we used derivatives to cover approximately 90 of our natural gas consumption   foreign currency exchange rates   in the fourth

derivatives are executed with several counterparties generally under international swaps and derivatives association isda agreements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for otc derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement these rights are described further below   settlement netting generally allows us and our counterparties to net into a single net payable or receivable ordinary settlement obligations arising between us under the isda agreement on the same day in the same currency for the same types of derivative instruments and through the same pairing of offices   closeout netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event as defined in the isda agreements including bankruptcy depending on the cause of early termination the nondefaulting party may elect to accelerate and terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the isda agreement the values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the isda agreement are netted resulting in a single net closeout amount payable to or by the nondefaulting party termination values may be determined using a marktomarket approach or based on a partys good faith estimate of its loss if the final net closeout amount is payable by the nondefaulting party that partys obligation to make the payment may be conditioned on factors such as the termination of all   124      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc    derivative transactions between the parties or payment in full of all of the defaulting partys obligations to the nondefaulting party in each case regardless of whether arising under the isda agreement or otherwise    setoff rights are provided by certain of our isda agreements and generally allow a nondefaulting party to elect to setoff against the final net closeout payment other matured and contingent amounts payable between us and our counterparties under the isda agreement or otherwise typically these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an isda agreement following a default or specified termination event    most of our isda agreements contain creditriskrelated contingent features with slidingscale credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the ratings assigned to our longterm unsecured debt by certain credit rating agencies downgrades in our credit ratings would cause the applicable threshold levels to decrease and improvements in those ratings could cause the threshold levels to increase if our net liability positions exceed the threshold amounts the counterparties could require cash collateral some other form of credit support or daily cash settlement of unrealized losses at december 31 2013 and 2012 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 02 million and 09 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to setoff collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event   the following table presents amounts relevant to offsetting of our derivative assets and liabilities at december 31

by counterparties was approximately 741 million and 127 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we do not believe the contractually allowed netting closeout netting or setoff of amounts owed to or due from the counterparties to our isda agreements would have a material effect on our financial position  125                table of contents   cf industries holdings inc  25 stockholders

federal and state numeric nutrient criteria regulation   on august 18 2009 the epa entered into a consent decree with certain environmental groups with respect to the promulgation of numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in surface waters in florida the consent decree was approved by a federal district court judge on november 16 2009 the epa adopted final numeric nutrient criteria for florida lakes and inland flowing waters on november 14 2010 on february 18 2012 the federal district court court upheld parts of the numeric nutrient criteria regulation but found that the epa had not adequately justified the criteria for streams and therefore concluded that the adoption of such criteria was arbitrary and capricious   subsequently the florida department of environmental protection fdep adopted its own nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for surface waters and related implementation standards on november 30 2012 the epa approved floridas nutrient criteria and on june 27 2013 the epa approved new water quality standards submitted by the fdep relating to the scope of coverage of the fdeps numeric nutrient criteria for surface waters on january 7 2014 the us district court for the northern district of florida granted the epas motion to amend the 2009 consent decree as a result the epa is no longer required by the consent decree to promulgate numeric nitrogen and phosphorous criteria for certain surface waters that the fdep had determined were more properly regulated by the states narrative standard the courts order allows the epa to withdraw its federal numeric nutrient criteria after which the fdeps regulations will become effective   the 2009 consent decree also required the epa to develop numeric nutrient criteria for florida coastal and estuarine waters although the epa proposed such criteria in 2012 the fdep submitted to the epa new numeric nutrient water quality standards for those waters on july 31 and august 1 2013 on september 26 2013 the epa approved floridas new and revised nutrient water quality standards for estuaries and coastal waters and informed the court that as a result it was not required to finalize the federal criteria that it had proposed   there is continuing regulatory uncertainty because the epas approval of the fdep nutrient water quality standards is still subject to challenge nonetheless numeric nutrient water quality criteria for florida waters whether federal or state could result in substantially more stringent nitrogen and phosphorous limits in wastewater discharge permits for our mining manufacturing and distribution operations in florida more stringent limits on wastewater discharge permits could increase our costs and limit our operations and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our

region near baton rouge louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville facility located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 the fee was to be assessed for each calendar year beginning in 2006 until the area achieved compliance with the ozone naaqs  134      table of contents  cf industries holdings inc   prior to the imposition of section 185 fees the epa adopted a new ozone standard the 8hour ozone standard and rescinded the 1hour ozone standard the baton rouge area was designated as a moderate nonattainment area with respect to the 8hour ozone standard however because section 185 fees had never been assessed prior to the rescission of the 1hour ozone standard rescinded prior to the november 30 2005 ozone attainment deadline the epa concluded in a 2004 rulemaking implementing the 8hour ozone standard that the act did not require states to assess section 185 fees as a result section 185 fees were not assessed against cf industries and other companies located in the baton rouge area   in 2006 the federal dc circuit court of appeals rejected the epas position and held that section 185 fees were controls that must be maintained and fees should have been assessed under the act in january 2008 the us supreme court declined to accept the case for review making the appellate courts decision final   in july 2011 the epa approved a revision to louisianas air pollution program that eliminated the requirement for baton rouge area companies to pay section 185 fees based on baton rouges ultimate attainment of the 1 hour standard through permanent and enforceable emissions reductions epas approval of the louisiana air program revision became effective on august 8 2011 however a recent decision by the federal dc circuit court of appeals struck down a similar but perhaps distinguishable epa guidance document regarding alternatives to section 185 fees at this time the viability of epas approval of louisianas elimination of section 185 fees is uncertain regardless of the approach ultimately adopted by the epa we expect that it is likely to be challenged by the environmental community the states andor affected industries therefore the costs associated with compliance with the act cannot be determined at this time and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows   clean air act information request   on february 26 2009 the company received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the act requesting information and copies of records relating to compliance with new source

party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in georgetown canyon idaho the current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the mine site ideq requested that each party indicate its willingness to enter into negotiations for a remedial investigation of the site the current owner indicated a willingness to negotiate while reserving all rights and not admitting liability we also indicated a willingness to negotiate negotiations are continuing we are not able to estimate at this time our
