 in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is dependent on north american natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia urea uan and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our nitrogen fertilizersthe price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2014 the average daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing basis in north america reached a low of 275 per mmbtu on december 26 2014 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014 during the three year period ended december 31 2014 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsnorth american natural gas prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of natural gas production from shale formations future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiessome of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs 11table of contentscf industries holdings incsuch as the price of chinese coal encourages exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsantidumping duties for russian and ukrainian fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate ended in november 2014 as a result we could face much higher volumes of lower priced russian and ukrainian fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in the united states a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our productsconditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlstate and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate the renewable fuel mandate which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in december 2014 the epa announced that the final ruling of the renewable fuels volumes required for calendar year 2014 would not be finalized in 2014 and would be made prior to or in conjunction with action on the standards applicable for calendar year 2015 developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environmentour operations and those of our joint ventures are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery may adversely affect our businesswe and our joint ventures use natural gas in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase the natural gas from third party suppliers and it is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint ventures by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties any delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas including those caused by capacity constraints leaks ruptures severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liabilitywe rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and other equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced recent periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our productsthese transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives local state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products12table of contentscf industries holdings incif shipping of our products was delayed or we were unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard tih materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished productsour operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business therefore our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our lossesour operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture transportation storage and distribution of chemical fertilizers including ammonia which is highly toxic and corrosive these hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters train derailments collisions vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks pipelines and rail cars spills discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents mechanical failures unscheduled plant downtime labor difficulties and other risks some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilitieswe maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coveragein april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility we have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in 2013 and 2014 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our product to west fertilizer co products we have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident based on our assessment of the pending lawsuits we believe that we have strong legal and factual defenses to the claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in the pending lawsuits and any other claims brought against us in connection with the incident in addition the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilitiescyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating resultsas we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations the risks associated with cyber security also increase we rely on management information systems and computer control systems business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers damage or loss of information due to viruses the unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to 13table of contentscf industries holdings incemployee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate to date we have not experienced any material impact from cyber security events however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogenbased fertilizers colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to risewe may not be able to complete our capacity expansion projects on

including as a result of acquisitions partnerships joint ventures business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented as a result of these and other factors including general economic risk we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions partnerships joint

government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over usour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the 16table of contentscf industries holdings incselling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2014 and 2013 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders was approximately 16 and 7 respectively of our cash and cash equivalentswe believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition 17table of contentscf industries holdings incour donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regionswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventureswe participate in joint ventures including point lisas which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago growhow which owns facilities in billingham and ince united kingdom and keytrade a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near zurich switzerland our joint venture partners may share a measure of control over the operations of our joint ventures as a result our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions requests policies or objectives subject a joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our businessin addition we may become involved in disputes with our joint venture partners which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsour joint venture in point lisas in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments are expected to continue into 2015 and it is unclear if they will extend beyond that time failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsacts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition

transportation security act of 2002 mtsa and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards cfats regulation in addition president obama issued executive order eo 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators local state federal and foreign governments could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that the united states or foreign governments could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell

and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impactedin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact on the importation of fertilizers foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investmentwe have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect usas of december 31 2014 we had approximately 46 billion of total indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing revolving credit facility of

obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such
