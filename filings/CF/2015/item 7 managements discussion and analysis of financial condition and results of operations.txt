strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand

american natural gas prices have declined over the last several years in response to increased supply from the development of natural gas production from shale formations future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas if this were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply

other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from both domestic and foreign sources most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiessome of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to

agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlstate and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate the renewable fuel mandate which could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand in december 2014 the epa

government agencies that we will have sufficient funds available for the ultimate closure postclosure care and reclamation at our facilities future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states or canada our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over usour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the 16table of contentscf industries holdings incselling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months as of december 31 2014 and 2013 our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders was approximately 16 and 7 respectively of our cash and cash equivalentswe believe the ability to purchase product on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are either multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in seven separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represents approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition 17table of contentscf industries holdings incour donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending

republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments are expected to continue into 2015 and it is unclear if they will extend beyond that time failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsacts of terrorism and regulations

important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such

prepared in accordance with us gaapnet operating loss nol settlementat the time of our initial public offering ipo in 2005 we had accumulated a substantial amount of nols due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit from the nols when we ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for income tax purposes and became a public company a full valuation allowance was recorded against the benefit of those nols at that time we entered into an agreement nol agreement with the preipo owners under which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved as of december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowancein january 2013 we and the preipo owners amended the nol agreement to provide among other things that we would be entitled to retain 269 of any settlement realized and 731 would be payable to themin march 2013 we entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service irs to resolve the tax treatment of the preipo nols pursuant to the closing agreement we agreed with the irs that we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to a portion of the nols over five years commencing with the 2012 tax year the 206 million net benefit from this nol settlement was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 as followsnol tax benefits of 758 million were recognized which reduced income tax expensea charge of 552 million was recognized for the 731 portion of the nol benefit that will be paid to the preipo owners as the tax benefits are realized the 552 million charge was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other nonoperatingnetfinancial executive summarywe reported net earnings of 14 billion in 2014 compared to net earnings of 15 billion in 2013 or a decline of 743 million or 5 diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased 9 to 2708 per share in 2014 from 2474 per share in 2013 as the impact of lower average shares outstanding in 2014 due to our share repurchase program offset the impact of lower net earnings during 2014 we repurchased 77 million shares of our common stock representing 14 of the prior year end outstanding shares at a cost of 19 billionthe 2014 reported results were significantly impacted by the sale of the companys phosphate business as the gain on the sale of this business partially offset a decline in operating results from our continuing nitrogen product segments in the first quarter of 2014 the company sold its phosphate business and recognized a pretax gain of 7501 million 4628 million after tax on the sale of this businessour gross margin declined by 7417 million or 29 to 18 billion in 2014 from 25 billion in 2013 the impact of the sale of the phosphate business reduced gross margin by 648 million while the decline in the nitrogen product segments reduced gross margin by 6769 million or 28 the decline in the nitrogen product segments was due primarily to lower average selling prices higher natural gas costs and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivativesaverage selling prices in the nitrogen product segments declined by 4 in 2014 as compared to 2013 which reduced gross margins by 3589 million the decline in selling prices was primarily attributable to lower 31table of contentscf industries holdings incammonia prices due to high producer inventory levels entering into 2014 and lower uan pricing due to customers preferences for attractively priced ammoniahigher physical natural gas costs partially offset by realized natural gas derivative impacts reduced gross margin by 1223 million as the extremely cold winter weather in north america at the beginning of 2014 caused a spike in natural gas costs that tempered as the year progressed but remained above 2013 levels for the entire yearunrealized marktomarket activity on natural gas derivatives decreased gross margin between the periods by 1324 million as 2014 included a 795 million loss and 2013 included a 529 million gainselling general and administrative expenses declined by 141 million or 8 to 1519 million in 2014 from 1660 million in 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs in 2014 and lower expenditures for certain corporate activities such as information technology projectsother operating expenses increased by 691 million from 158 million of income in 2013 to expense of 533 million in 2014 the increased expense was due primarily to losses on foreign currency derivatives contracts resulting from a strengthening us dollar and from increases in certain expenses related to our capacity expansion projects that do not qualify for capitalization the derivative contracts are used to hedge our european euro exposure on equipment purchases relating to our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowanet interest expense increased by 298 million to 1773 million in 2014 from 1475 million in 2013 due primarily to the interest expense on the 15 billion of senior notes issued during the first quarter of 2014 and the 15 billion of senior notes issued during the second quarter of 2013 this increase was partially offset by increased capitalized interest of 742 million in 2014 primarily related to our capacity expansion projects compared to 267 million in 2013net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was 14 billion as compared to 15 billion in 2013 the 582 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from lower earnings from core operating activities partially offset by favorable working capital changes during 2014 versus 2013 the lower earnings from core operating activities were primarily the result of the 7417 million decline in gross margin partially offsetting the decline in gross margin 6386 million less was invested in net working capital than in 2013 improvements in working capital during 2014 were due to a combination of higher customer advances lower inventory levels and lower amounts paid for income taxes in 2014 as compared in 2013 customer advances are higher in anticipation of a busy spring 2015 application season combined with tighter north american nitrogen fertilizer supply compared to the prior year periodnet cash used in investing activities was 3435 million in 2014 compared to 10193 million in 2013 during 2014 we spent 18 billion on capital expenditures primarily related to the capacity expansion projects partially offset by the proceeds of 14 billion we received from the sale of phosphate business in 2013 we spent 8238 million in capital expenditures and made a 1540 million deposit in a restricted cash account both primarily related to the major capacity expansion projects at our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa facilities we are currently constructing new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex that are referred to as

outstanding shares at a cost of 05 billionkey industry factorswe operate in a highly competitive global industry our agricultural products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined belowglobal supply amp demandhistorically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption federal regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs availability of raw materials government policies and global tradenatural gas pricesnatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2014 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014 and a low of 184 per mmbtu on april 20 2012 natural gas costs including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives rose 16 in 2014 from 2013 expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 52 of our nitrogen product segments total production costs in 2014farmers economicsthe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted33table of contentscf industries holdings incglobal trade in fertilizerin addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the worldimports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north americagovernment policiesthe policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices the subsidization of domestic producers and the subsidization of exports due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by political and social objectivesethanol industry and the renewable fuel standardcorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states supply of fuel for transportation for 2015 the environmental protection agency epa has yet to determine the rfs resulting in uncertainty for ethanol demand in addition congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not passed there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be passed into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industryfactors affecting our resultsnet sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net salescost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customerswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we often use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing costs for nitrogenbased fertilizer we report our natural gas derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of derivativesselling general and administrative expenses our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payrollrelated costs for our executive administrative legal financial and marketing functions as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees including those for corporate initiatives34table of

margin for the nitrogen product segments declined by 6769 million or 28 this decline in gross margin is due primarily to the following factorsaverage selling prices in the nitrogen product segments

sales decreased 7315 million or 13 to 47 billion in 2014 compared to 55 billion in 2013 these results were impacted by the cfl selling price modifications in the prior year on an as adjusted basis 2014 net sales decreased 14 compared to 2013 the 7315 million decrease in net sales is attributable to a 1030 million decrease in the nitrogen product segments and a 6285 million decrease in the phosphate segment due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014nitrogen product segments net sales decreased 1030 million or 2 due primarily to a 4 decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 3 increase in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices declined due primarily to lower ammonia and uan selling prices compared to the prior year period ammonia prices were lower due primarily to the higher producer inventory levels that carried over from the end of 2013 as compared to the previous year as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions the decline in uan prices was due primarily to customer preferences for attractively priced ammonia during the extended spring ammonia application season in 2014 nitrogen product segments sales volume increased due primarily to increased sales of ammonia and increased sales in the other segment mainly an and def ammonia volume benefited this year from a combination of attractive pricing compared to other forms of nitrogen fertilizer favorable weather conditions that resulted in an extended spring application season and effective utilization of our terminal and logistics system to resupply in advance of periods of high demand in addition sales to mosaic under our ammonia supply contract from our plnl joint venture also increased volume compared to the prior year period other segment sales volume increased due to higher an exports and increased late season an fertilizer demand compared to the prior year period def volume increased along with the growing north american def marketcost of salestotal cost of sales increased 102 million from 2013 to 2014 due primarily to higher nitrogen product segments cost of sales partially offset by the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 total cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments averaged 211 per ton in 2014 compared to 172 per ton in 2013 this 23 increase was due primarily to higher natural gas costs and higher other production costs total realized gas costs increased 16 natural gas costs for the current year also included a 795

expenses and distribution and storage expenses compared to the prior yearselling general and administrative expensesselling general and administrative expenses decreased 141 million to 1519 million in

new ammonia and urea plants at port neal iowa the update was based upon refined estimates for specific quantities of construction materials and workhours based upon final issuedforconstruction drawings from the engineering firms designing the plants based on this review the aggregate cost estimate for both projects has increased just under 10 from the original 38 billion to approximately 42 billion the total project cost includes engineering and design equipment procurement construction associated infrastructure including natural gas connections and power supply and product storage and handling systems taking into account the more detailed engineering and construction information and additional progress we have made on the projects the potential variance to the budget has also been tightened to plus or minus a few percentage points as compared to the original plus or minus 10 level of accuracy we have found that the full impact of the costs associated with building the plants in western iowa will exceed the original estimate due to increases in material content and higher labor costs than initially modeled there are additional materials and work hours needed for increased construction and winterization scope and higher wage and per diem rates to attract and retain the qualified skilledtrade workers compared to the original estimatethese new plants will increase our

ammonia and granular urea production for additional information see note 18noncontrolling interest to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this reportrepatriation of foreign earnings and income taxeswe have operations in canada and interests in corporate joint ventures in the united kingdom the republic of trinidad and tobago and switzerland the estimated additional us and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the us are recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings are recognized unless the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested based upon our current plans however the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurs at the time of the repatriation as a result the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings as applicable and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings can occur in different periods cash balances held by corporate joint ventures are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint ventures on a periodic basisas of december 31 2014 approximately 3440 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 20 billion was held by our canadian subsidiaries the cash balance held by the canadian subsidiaries represents accumulated earnings of our foreign operations which is not considered to be permanently reinvested we have recognized deferred income taxes on these earnings for the foreign and domestic taxes that would be due upon their repatriation to the united states as of december 31 2014 the cash tax cost to repatriate the canadian cash balances would be approximately 172 milliondebtcredit agreementwe have a revolving credit facility that provides for 10 billion of borrowing by cf industries for general corporate purposes all obligations

indentures governing the senior notes identified in the table above each series of senior notes is guaranteed by cf holdings the indentures contain customary events of default and covenants that limit among other things the ability of cf holdings and its subsidiaries including cf industries to incur liens on certain properties to secure debt if a change of control occurs together with a ratings downgrade as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the senior notes cf industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the

guarantee the 20182020 notes53table of contentscf industries holdings incforward sales and customer advanceswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose we also often use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers because we often use derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives additionally our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had 3254 million and 1206 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheetswhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under our credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activityunder our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported salesderivative financial instrumentswe often use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties we control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies and in most cases the use of international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangementsthe isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 471 million and 02 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 587 million mmbtus and 763 million mmbtus respectively as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contractsas of december 31 2014 and 2013 the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 2528 million and 6363 million

year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was 14 billion as compared to 15 billion in 2013 the 582 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from lower earnings from core operating activities partially offset by favorable working capital changes during 2014 as compared to 2013 the lower earnings from core operating activities were primarily a result of the 7417 million decline in gross margin partially offsetting the decline in gross margin 6386 million less was invested in net working capital than in 2013 improvements in working capital during 2014 were due to a combination of higher customer advances lower inventory levels and lower amounts paid for income taxes in 2014 as compared in 2013 customer advances are higher in anticipation of a busy spring 2015 application season combined with tighter north american nitrogen fertilizer supply compared to the prior year periodyear ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012 net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was 15 billion as compared to 24 billion in 2012 the 09 billion decline was due to the combination of a 3906 million decline in net earnings and a higher level of net working capital invested in the business in 2013 versus 2012 during 2013 7402 million more was invested in net working capital than in 2012 due

revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resourcescritical accounting policies and estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap us gaap requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience technological assessment opinions of appropriate outside experts and the most recent information available to us actual results may differ from these estimates changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer which can be at the plant gate a distribution facility a supplier location or a customer destination in some cases application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue discounts and allowances rebates or creditworthiness of some of our customers we base our estimates on historical experience and the most recent information available to us which can change as market conditions change amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net salesproperty plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using either the straightline method or the unitsofproduction method over the lives of the assets the lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us estimated lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the depreciable lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviewsscheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors 57table of contentscf industries holdings incturbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shut down including required safety inspections which entails the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line entitled additions to property plant and equipmentinventory valuationwe review our inventory account balances at least quarterly and more frequently if required by market conditions to determine whether the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our most recent estimate of net realizable value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of salesasset retirement obligationsasset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have unrecorded aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2014 dollars is 510 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2014 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusionfor additional information see note 21asset retirement obligations to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this reportrecoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiarieswe review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our reviewthe recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired we review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates annually to determine if there is a loss in value of the investment we determine the fair value of the investment using an income approach valuation method if the sum of the expected future discounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized immediatelyour joint venture investment in trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and continues to generate positive income and cash flow the financial results are included in the information in note 10equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and 58table of contentscf industries holdings incdevelopment activity in trinidad and tobago these curtailments are expected to continue into 2015 and it is unclear if they will continue beyond that time natural gas exploration activities in trinidad and tobago are being conducted and publiclyreported results indicate that additional natural gas will be available in the future however commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing the book value of our joint venture investment in trinidad and tobago at december 31 2014 that was subject to impairment review was 3633 million no impairment was recognized in 2014 2013 or 2012 related to this investmentwe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2014 2013 or 2012 reviews as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the carrying value of our goodwill was 21 billionderivative financial instrumentsthe accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as the changes occur and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedge item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as the changes occurcertain of our foreign currency derivatives that we use to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates on eurodenominated expenditures associated with our major capacity expansion projects have been designated as cash flow hedges the expected cash flows for the capital projects involve the use of judgments and estimates which are subject to change we assess both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the designated cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable hedge accounting is discontinued in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accountingincome taxeswe recognize expenses assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period when these changes occurincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectivelya deferred income tax liability is recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that are considered to not be permanently reinvested no 59table of contentscf industries holdings incdeferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures which we believe to be indefinitely reinvestedas a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable it is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense net income and liquidity in future periodswe operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions the taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe including the countries in which we operate the tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries as a result there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances we work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions however there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical as of december 31 2014 we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest of 1604 million which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimatespension assets and liabilitiespension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized our projected benefit obligation pbo related to our qualified pension plans was 7878 million as of december 31 2014 which was 1230 million higher than pension plan assets the december 31 2014 pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rate of 40 which was based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo if the discount rate used to compute the pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 521 million higher or 469 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussedthe weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2014 was 48 if the discount rate used to compute 2014 pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 40 million higher or 05 million lower respectively than the amount calculated our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 55 weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2014 is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods if the expected longterm rate of return on assets was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2014 would have been 33 million lower or higher respectively see note 13pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion

during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing
