demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of

business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply and demand balance in recent years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a global nitrogen fertilizer oversupply leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environmentselling prices reached multiyear lows in 2016 the average selling price for our products in 2016 was 217 per ton compared to 314 per ton in 2015 a decline of 31additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next twelve months we cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause delays cancellation or acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projectswe expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer the period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertainour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry has increased and future consolidation is expected to further increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in september 2016 our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc announced plans to merge some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at low rates if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance 11table of contentscf industries holdings incbetween global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our competitors in russia have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia could lead to significant increases in imports from that country we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our productsconditions in us european and other global agriculture areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our

contentscf industries holdings incchanges in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur

may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer

accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury to date our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material however we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us or if our

the epa published a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone ozone attainment designations are expected by october 2017 and this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operationsfuture regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to greenhouse gas regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facilitys net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta in june 2016 alberta promulgated the climate leadership implementation act which will impose a wideranging carbon tax the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter facilities such as ours that are subject to the existing specified gas emitters regulation will continue to be subject to this regulation in the near term after which new product and sectorbased performance standards to be developed will become effective our courtright ontario facility will be subject to ontarios ghg cap and trade program beginning in january 2017 which regulation was finalized in may 2016 in addition in october 2016 canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced that his government will introduce a plan to put a nationwide price on carbon emissions which plan would serve as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15 c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output 20table of contentscf industries holdings increquire us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over usour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the 21table of contentscf industries holdings incextent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability positionthe counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirementswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2016 including the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects which were completed in 2016 the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customerswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint venturewe have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or

which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsplnls ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited pursuant to a gas sales contract the ngc contract the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl in 2016 ngc communicated to plnl that it does not recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to renew the ngc contract for an additional fiveyear term beyond its current termination date in september 2018 and that any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2018 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl has initiated arbitration proceedings against ngc and asserted claims in connection with ngcs failure to supply the contracted quantities of natural gas and its refusal to recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to extend the ngc contract plnl is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for 22table of contentscf industries holdings incpast and ongoing curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testingas part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million impairment charge in 2016 previously in 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2016 is approximately 139 million failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in plnl which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsacts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect

addition president obama issued executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for uswe are subject to risks

variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign

could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the potential impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impactedin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect

conditions we operate in a highly competitive global industry our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined belowglobal commoditiesour products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demandglobal supply and demand factorshistorically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth gross domestic product growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption governmental regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india russia and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of nitrogenbased fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities over the last decade strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity as a result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply in the market and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in addition lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environmentglobal trade in fertilizerin addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the worldimports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north americafarmers economicsthe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted32table of contentscf industries holdings inc2016 market conditionsour 2016 results were impacted by excess global nitrogen supply and the resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there through most of 2016 nitrogen pricing at the us gulf declined often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to excess global nitrogen supply as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multiyear lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year the average selling price for our products in 2016 was 217 per ton compared to 314 per ton in 2015 a decrease of 31 resulting in a decrease in both net sales and gross margin of approximately 138 billion between the periods the decline in selling prices has impacted each of our reportable segments in addition during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices which has also negatively impacted our sales volumein the fourth quarter of 2016 the following developments impacted the global nitrogen fertilizer market a decline in chinese nitrogen fertilizer operating rates due to rising production costs and lower global selling prices led to reduced chinese urea supply availability in china and in international markets higher global oil prices have resulted in higher effective natural gas prices in europe and russia and this has contributed to increasing nitrogen fertilizer manufacturers production costs in these regions customers delayed purchasing into the fourth quarter of 2016 which reduced inventory levels in the supply chain increases in demand caused higher pricing as 2016 ended as customers began taking deliveries in anticipation of the 2017 spring application seasonthese factors have led to an increase in global nitrogen pricing at the end of 2016 a significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2017 including a significant increase in production capacity located in north america the new capacity will further increase supply we expect nitrogen fertilizer prices to rise going into the 2017 spring application season due to seasonal demand however we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line33table of contentscf industries holdings incitems affecting comparability of results during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 certain significant items

net marktomarket gain loss on natural gas derivatives  natural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting this can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives in 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 260 million

benefit provision declined by 464 million to a net benefit of 68 million in 2016 from an income tax provision of 396 million for 2015 primarily as a result of the loss recognized in 2016 see note 10income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on our income tax benefitselling general and administrative expenses increased 4 million to 174 million in 2016 from 170 million in 2015 the increase was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition partly offset by lower costs for corporate initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expensetransaction costs incurred in 2016 of 179 million are associated primarily with the agreements pertaining to the proposed combination with certain businesses of oci that was terminated on may 22 2016 and our strategic venture with chs transaction costs include the 150 million termination fee paid by cf holdings to oci in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the combination agreement and costs for various consulting and legal servicesother operatingnet increased by 116 million from 92 million in 2015 to 208 million in 2016 the increased expense was due primarily to realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to british pound sterling denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of 23 million representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with chs these increases were partly offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives of 22 million39table of contentscf industries holdings incnet interest expense increased by 64 million to 195 million in 2016 from 131 million in 2015 the 64 million increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of 10 billion of private senior notes in september 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to restructuring of our debt and the revolving credit agreement in 2016 in 2016 we modified the revolving credit agreement by reducing its size from 20 billion to 750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms as a result of these changes we recognized 16 million of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense the increase in interest expensenet in 2016 also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of 28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the oci businesses we also recorded capitalized interest of 166 million in 2016 related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to 154 million in 2015in 2016 we prepaid in full the outstanding 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our private senior notes and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 167

121 billion in 2015 a decline of 590 million the decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016 due to lower average selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016 contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales was paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment net cash used in investing activities was 218 billion in 2016 compared to 298 billion in 2015 this decrease is due primarily to the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of 552 million which was net of cash acquired of 18 million this decrease was also attributable in part to a decline in capital expenditures

in sales volume 42table of contentscf industries holdings incaverage selling prices excluding the cf fertilisers uk acquisition impact were 218 per ton in 2016 compared to 318 per ton in 2015 due primarily to lower selling prices across all products selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the us gulf declined during most of 2016 often trading below parity with other international pricing points as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest seasonal decreases in

by 24 from 2015 to 2016 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 10 the remaining increase in our sales volume of 14 was due primarily to greater granular urea and

cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased gross margin by 23 million the remaining decline in our gross margin of 254 million or 14 was due to the 244 million decrease in gross margin in the nitrogen product segments and the 10 million decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease in nitrogen product segments gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical natural gas costsaverage selling prices primarily uan and granular urea decreased by 8 which reduced gross margin by 349 million as international nitrogen fertilizer prices declined due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global pricessales volume primarily ammonia decreased by 3 which decreased gross margin by 72 million due primarily to a poor fall application season and weaker demand as customers were unable to apply ammonia due to poor weather conditions and customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas

million the remaining decline in our net sales of 643 million or 14 included a 475 million decrease attributable to the nitrogen product segments and a 168 million decrease due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 the remaining nitrogen product segments net sales decreased due to an 8 decline in average selling prices and a 3 decline in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices excluding the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition were 318 per ton in 2015 compared to 345 per ton in 2014 due primarily to lower uan granular urea and ammonia selling prices in 2015 as international nitrogen fertilizer prices declined due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices the decline in uan average selling prices was due primarily to excess global supply granular urea exports from china were at a record high in 2015 and russian exports increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the global supply excess and the decline in average selling prices compared to 2014 the decrease in ammonia average selling prices from prior year levels is due primarily to weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions compared to the prior year as a weak fall application season combined with higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 our total nitrogen product segments sales volume increased by 3 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 6 the remaining decline in our nitrogen product segments sales volume of 3 was due primarily to lower ammonia and uan sales volume our ammonia sales volume was lower in 2015 partly due to a poor fall application season in north america as a result of poor weather conditions in the midwest the season started late and ended early in november due to snow in the midwest in addition our ammonia and uan sales volume were lower as customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment cost of salesour total cost of sales decreased 204 million or 7 from 2014 to 2015 including the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition which increased cost of sales by 185 million or 6 the remaining decrease in our cost of sales of 389 million or 13 was due primarily to lower natural gas costs the realized natural gas costs including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivative losses during 2015 decreased 28 compared to 2014 cost of sales in 2015 also included 176 million of unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives compared to losses of 79 million in 2014 lower gas costs were primarily driven by increasing north american natural gas production as increased well efficiencies increased supply warm weather conditions especially in the fourth quarter also contributed to the high storage levels and the resulting decline in gas prices the cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments averaged 200 in 2015 a 5 decrease from the 211 per ton in 2014 selling general and administrative expensesselling general and administrative expenses increased 18 million to 170 million in 2015 from 152 million in 2014 the increase was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition an increase in corporate project activities and higher intangible asset amortization expensetransaction costsin 2015 we incurred 57 million of transaction costs for various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements in connection with

owned by usother operatingnetother operatingnet changed by 39 million from 53 million of expense in 2014 to expense of 92 million in 2015 the increased expense was due primarily to higher expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization this was partially offset by the decrease in realized

result in the imposition of taxes duties tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world the policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic political and social objectives additionally the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity the impact of changes in governmental policies or laws

sales and customer advanceswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had 42 million and 162 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheetswhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals during periods of declining prices such as the current environment customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activityunder our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported salesnatural gas pricesnatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 47 of our total production costs in 2016 as a result natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity65table of contentscf industries holdings incbecause most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america have declined since 2008 but are subject to volatility during 2016 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north

changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we use derivative instruments volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of the derivatives in 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized unrealized net marktomarket gains losses on natural gas derivatives of 260 million 176

part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreementthe isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivativesas of december 31 2016 and 2015 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was zero

million the decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during 2016 due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016 contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales was paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower

december 31 2014 net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was 121 billion as compared to 142 billion in 2014 the 214 million decrease was primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes as customer advances were lower and inventory levels were higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 levels due to the declining pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizers in 2015 customers delayed making forward purchase commitments to purchase fertilizer in 2015 which reduced the amount of customer advances that were received as compared to 2014 when fertilizer pricing was stronger a poor fall

required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs

longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2016 dollars is 72 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2016 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusionrecoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiarieswe review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our reviewthe recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earningsplnl is our joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the ngc pursuant to the ngc contract the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl in 2016 ngc communicated to plnl that it does not recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to renew the ngc contract for an additional fiveyear term beyond its current termination date in september 2018 and that any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2018 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl has initiated arbitration proceedings against ngc and asserted claims in connection with ngcs failure to supply the contracted quantities of natural gas and its refusal to recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to extend the ngc contract plnl is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for past and ongoing curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for

carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2016 is approximately 139 million if ngc does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to plnl at prices that permit profitable operations plnl may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in plnlwe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2016 2015 or 2014 reviews as of december 31 2016
