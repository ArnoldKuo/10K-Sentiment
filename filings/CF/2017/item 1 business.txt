technology fund in june 2016 alberta promulgated the climate leadership implementation act which will impose a wideranging carbon tax the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter facilities such as ours that are subject to the existing specified gas emitters regulation will continue to be subject to this regulation in the near term after which new product and sectorbased performance standards to be developed will become effectivethe united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a party to the paris agreement however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and report the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our us production facilities are locatediowa louisiana mississippi and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissionsnew source performance standards for nitric acid plantswe operate 14 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gasregulatory permits and approvalswe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits on december 15 2016 the epa redesignated the greater baton rouge nonattainment area brna where our donaldsonville facility is located to attainment with the 2008 8hour ozone standard however on october 26 2015 the epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone the state of louisiana has recommended to the epa that baton rouge be designated as nonattainment with the 2015 ozone standard such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals the epa is supposed to designate areas under the 2015 standard by october 2017employeesas of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 2900 fulltime and 100 parttime employees10table of contentscf industries holdings inc
