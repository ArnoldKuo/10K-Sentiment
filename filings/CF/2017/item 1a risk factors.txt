 in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage crop selection and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply and demand balance in recent years fertilizer producers including cf holdings have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a global nitrogen fertilizer oversupply leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environmentselling prices reached multiyear lows in 2016 the average selling price for our products in 2016 was 217 per ton compared to 314 per ton in 2015 a decline of 31additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next twelve months we cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause delays cancellation or acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projectswe expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production our financial performance credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer the period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows is uncertainour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry has increased and future consolidation is expected to further increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in september 2016 our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc announced plans to merge some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at low rates if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance 11table of contentscf industries holdings incbetween global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our competitors in russia have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions the 2016 revocations of us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia could lead to significant increases in imports from that country we also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our productsconditions in us european and other global agriculture areas significantly impact our operating results agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea urea ammonium nitrate solution uan ammonium nitrate an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2016 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 149 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 377 per mmbtu on december 8 2016 during the threeyear period ended december 31 2016 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 149 per mmbtu on three consecutive days in march 2016 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national

201412table of contentscf industries holdings incchanges in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a

was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption in re west explosion cases the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325

approximately 578 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 or approximately 47 of our total capitalization and an additional 695 million of senior secured borrowing availability reflecting no outstanding borrowings and 55 million of outstanding letters of credit under our senior secured revolving credit agreement as amended the revolving credit agreement our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding our substantial indebtedness could through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us not to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures and other business activities cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be at variable rates of interest make us

to repurchase shares of our common stock limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and result in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit

such as market prices for our fertilizer products natural gas prices and other business competitive and regulatory factors many of which are beyond our control we may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants in that event we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments or refinance our debt and even if we were able to do so such relief might only last for a limited period potentially necessitating additional amendments waivers or refinancings any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments an event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness which could materially and adversely impair our business operations an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit agreement furthermore our revolving credit agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our revolving credit agreement or the senior secured notes our revolving credit agreement

control systems could have severe financial and other business implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting growing harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to riseour ability to use our tax net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset taxable income could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownershipwe estimate that we generated a federal tax net operating loss of approximately 2 billion in 2016 arising primarily from accelerated federal tax depreciation and federal bonus depreciation on our capital projects in addition we generated significant state income tax loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards as a result of state tax depreciation and loss carryforwards as well as foreign tax credit carryforwards we project that we will generate additional federal tax loss carryforwards in 2017 primarily arising from accelerated federal tax depreciation on our capital projects our ability to use our tax net operating losses tax credits and certain other tax assets the tax benefits to offset taxable income could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined under section 382 of the internal revenue code and related internal revenue service irs pronouncements in general an ownership change would occur if the companys 5percent shareholders as defined under section 382 collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points during the relevant testing period additionally various states have similar limitations on the use of state net operating losses following an ownership changeif an ownership change occurs our ability to use our tax benefits to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount equal to 1 the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the longterm taxexempt interest rate plus 2 builtin gains on certain assets held prior to the ownership change that are recognized during the fiveyear period following the ownership changeon september 6 2016 the board adopted a tax

incin addition we intend to file a claim to carry back federal and state tax losses from 2016 to prior income tax years and receive a refund of federal and state taxes paid in those prior years we currently estimate that the amount of this refund will be approximately 800 million and expect to receive it in the third quarter of 2017 the majority of the refund relates to accelerated depreciation

cash we generate outside the united states primarily to fund development of our business in nonus jurisdictions if the funds generated by our us business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the united states we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the united states under current us tax laws those international earnings would be subject to us tax and the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay us income taxeswe also need to comply with other new evolving or revised tax laws and regulations the enactment of or increases in tariffs or value added taxes or other changes in the application of existing taxes in markets in which we are currently

facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 26 2015 the epa published a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone ozone attainment designations are expected by october 2017 and this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operationsfuture regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to greenhouse gas regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facilitys net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta in june 2016 alberta promulgated the climate leadership implementation act which will impose a wideranging carbon tax the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter facilities such as ours that are subject to the existing specified gas emitters regulation will continue to be subject to this regulation in the near term after which new product and sectorbased performance standards to be developed will become effective our courtright ontario facility will be subject to ontarios ghg cap and trade program beginning in january 2017 which regulation was finalized in may 2016 in addition in october 2016 canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced that his government will introduce a plan to put a nationwide price on carbon emissions which plan would serve as a floor for the ghg emissions reduction requirements of the separate canadian provinces and territories the announced plan would impose a 10 per ton canadian dollars charge beginning in 2018 rising to 50 per ton by 2022there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15 c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement which has been accepted by the united states and ratified by canada and the united kingdom went into effect in november 2016 however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output 20table of contentscf

adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over usour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products in north america occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the 21table of contentscf industries holdings incextent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position additionally the international swaps and derivative association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability positionthe counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirementswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which represented approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity as of december 31 2016 including the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects which were completed in 2016 the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with chs inc we may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with chs that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with chs or our other customerswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint venturewe have a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of

national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited pursuant to a gas sales contract the ngc contract the joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from ngc which have reduced the ammonia production at plnl in 2016 ngc communicated to plnl that it does not recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to renew the ngc contract for an additional fiveyear term beyond its current termination date in september 2018 and that any ngc commitment to supply gas beyond 2018 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price plnl has initiated arbitration proceedings against ngc and asserted claims in connection with ngcs failure to supply the contracted quantities of natural gas and its refusal to recognize the joint ventures exercise of its option to extend the ngc contract plnl is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for 22table of contentscf industries holdings incpast and ongoing curtailments although the joint venture believes its claims against ngc to be meritorious it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration there are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture that are uncertain at this time including the quantities of gas ngc will make available the cost of such gas the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testingas part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in plnl we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a 134 million impairment charge in 2016 previously in 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 62 million related to our equity method investment in plnl the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl at december 31 2016 is approximately 139 million failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment

industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of

coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower

the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar the british pound and the euro these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change including for example in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the united kingdom in june 2016 which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union brexit we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely

the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the potential impact of brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impactedin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets
