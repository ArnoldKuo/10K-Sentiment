litigationwest fertilizer coon april 17 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption in re west explosion cases the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities motions for summary judgment in august 2015 thirtyfour cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings the next group of cases was reset for trial beginning on april 3 2017 while we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits including in any appeals that may follow we have concluded based on continuing developments in the case that some loss is probable for a subset of the outstanding claims we have made an accrual for this subset of the outstanding claims which is not material to the consolidated financial statements beyond the amounts accrued the company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties the recognition of a potential loss in the future in the west fertilizer co litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition however based upon currently available information including available insurance coverage we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash
