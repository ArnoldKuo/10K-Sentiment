a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the combination before or after it is completed we and oci may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust and competition laws we have agreed to pay oci 150 million if the combination agreement is terminated in certain circumstances if certain regulatory approvals are not obtainedwe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed combination with the ena business of oci is pending which could adversely affect our business and operations in connection with the pending combination with the ena business of oci it is possible that some customers suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the combination which could negatively affect our revenues and earnings as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the combination is completed 12table of contentscf industries holdings incunder the terms of the combination agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies these restrictions the waiver of which is subject to the consent of oci not to be unreasonably withheld could prevent us from taking certain actions that may be beneficial to our business such as making acquisitions pursuing certain business opportunities or entering into certain financing instruments such limitations could negatively affect our operations and business prior to the closingfurthermore the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the postcombination period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us the combination agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the combination could discourage potential alternative transactions andor third parties from making alternative transaction proposals and could require in certain circumstances that we pay a termination fee of 150 million pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement we may be required to pay a termination fee of 150 million if the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement are not consummated because of the occurrence of certain events including a change to the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the proposals related to the combination that are to be voted on by our stockholders such a fee could be payable even if no other alternative transaction is consummated in addition if the combination agreement is terminated because we fail to obtain the required approval of our stockholders we are obligated to reimburse ocis expenses up to a cap of 30 millionwe are generally prohibited from entering into an acquisition agreement with a third party soliciting an alternative proposal from any third party involving 15 or more of our common stock assets or earning power and subject to limited exceptions participating in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal that is or could reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal or furnishing any nonpublic information in connection therewith in addition under the terms of the combination agreement we are not permitted to terminate the combination agreement if our board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the combination agreement or approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal and must continue in these circumstances to submit the combination agreement for consideration by our stockholders unless oci terminates the combination agreementthe presence of the above provisions and the termination fee could discourage third parties from making alternative acquisition proposals even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the proposed market value of the shares in the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement as a result third parties may make acquisition proposals if at all at a lower price than they would otherwise be willing to make in the absence of such restrictions on the ability of our board of directors to consider andor negotiate with respect to such proposals we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring significant liability failure to complete the proposed combination with the ena business of oci or

including the followingwe may be liable for damages to oci under the terms and conditions of the combination agreement negative reactions from the financial markets including declines in the price of our common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the combination will be completed having to pay certain significant costs relating to the combination lost

executives and other employees in light of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we could experience difficulty in attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees due to the uncertainty of the closing of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci in addition certain key employees of the ena business may not wish to become employees of new cf until completion of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement employee retention could be a challenge for us as employees may have uncertainty about the combination and their future roles with new cf if our employees or employees of the ena business depart prior to the closing of the combination due to uncertainty or the difficulty of integrating the two businesses new cfs ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement could be reduced or delayedwe are subject to risk associated with the chs strategic venture we may not realize the full benefits from the chs strategic venture that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliersour business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 330 per mmbtu on january 16 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 850 per mmbtu on february 12 2015

2013changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows14table of contentscf industries holdings incour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiesconsolidation in the industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour competitors in russia and ukraine have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions most us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine will be under review by government agencies in the coming year and any revocation of such measures could lead to significant increases in imports from these countrieswe also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our productsconditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results our operating results are also affected by conditions in the european agricultural industry the agricultural industries in the united states and europe can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that 15table of contentscf industries holdings inchave also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for

implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to risewe may not be

respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter in april 2015 the province of ontario canada announced that it intends to implement a ghg cap and trade program in november 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system which notice indicated that ontario intended to commence operation of the cap and trade program effective january 1 2017 there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us20table of contentscf industries holdings incour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks 21table of contentscf industries holdings incmajor financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which currently represents approximately 35 of our ammonia production capacity and will represent approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity after the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are fully operational the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventureas of december 31 2015 our remaining joint venture is a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our businessin addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsour plnl joint venture operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments have continued into 2015 and we are unable to predict when the curtailments will cease to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl as we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future in addition failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsdue

maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or 22table of contentscf industries holdings inclimitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for uswe are subject to risks associated with international operationsour international business

regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar british pound and the euro we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through

persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted23table of contentscf industries holdings incin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investmentwe have a material amount of indebtedness expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis following consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci and may need to incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our businessas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 56 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 we had excess borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement of 19951 million in addition upon the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis we expect that this indebtedness will include our existing indebtedness approximately 12 billion of existing secured project finance indebtedness relating to the ena business and indebtedness under any of the existing oci convertible bonds assumed by us in connection with the combination in addition to fund the cash requirements in connection with the consummation of the combination we expect that we or our subsidiaries will use either cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from external sources whether using alternative financing arranged prior to the closing under the combination agreement or if such financing is not arranged a portion of the financing under our bridge credit agreement of approximately 10 billion in addition upon the consummation of the combination our bridge credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 13 billion for general corporate purposes and our existing revolving credit agreement provides for up to 20 billion of borrowings for general corporate purposesour substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures research and development and other business activities cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditionsexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our credit agreements could be at variable rates of interest make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes andresult in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe expect that the terms of our indebtedness will allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our bridge credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected24table of

business of 7501 million and 4628 million respectively under the terms of the definitive transaction agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary courseupon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate

through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceasesimpairment of our investment in plnlin 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value this was primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments impacting the results of operations of plnl and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future our plnl joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability

6904 million or 50 the 2014 reported results were significantly impacted by the sale of our phosphate business in the first quarter of 2014 we sold the phosphate business and recognized a pretax gain of 7501 million 4628 million after tax on the sale of this business diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 45 to 296 per share in 2015 from 542 per share in 2014 this decrease is due to lower net earnings partly offset by the lower diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding in 2015 as compared to the prior year during 2015 we repurchased 89 million shares of our common stock representing 4 of the prior year end outstanding shares at a cost of 5272 millionin 2015 our total gross margin declined by 2314 million or 13 to 155 billion in 2015 from 178 billion in 2014 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased gross margin by 235 million the remaining decline in our gross margin of 2549 million or 14 was due to the 2448 million decrease in gross margin in the nitrogen product segments and the 101 million decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease in nitrogen product segments gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical natural gas costsaverage selling prices primarily uan and granular urea decreased by 8 which reduced gross margin by 3488 million as international nitrogen fertilizer prices continued to decline due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices sales volume primarily ammonia decreased by 3 which decreased gross margin by 723 million due primarily to a poor fall application season and weaker demand as customers were unable to apply ammonia due to poor weather conditions and customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives decreased gross margin by 968 million as 2015 included a 1763 million loss compared to 795 million loss in 2014 lower physical natural gas costs in 2015 partially offset by the impact of natural gas derivatives that settled in the period increased gross margin by 2298 million compared to 2014 lower gas costs were primarily driven by increased north american natural gas production as increased well efficiencies increased supply warm weather conditions especially in the fourth quarter also contributed to high storage levels and the resulting decline in gas prices selling general and administrative expenses increased 179 million to 1698 million in 2015 from 1519 million in 2014 the increase was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition an increase in corporate project activities and higher intangible amortization coststransaction costs incurred in 2015 of 569 million are attributable to various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements and preparing for the proposed combination with the ena business of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us other operatingnet increased by 390 million from 533 million of expense in 2014 to expense of 923 million in 2015 the increased expense was due primarily to increased expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization compared to 2014net interest expense decreased by 457 million to 1316 million in 2015 from 1773 million in 2014 due primarily to the higher amounts of capitalized interest related to our capacity expansion projects partially offset by higher interest expense pertaining to the 10 billion and 15 billion of senior notes that were issued in september 2015 and 38table of

2014net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was 120 billion as compared to 141 billion in 2014 a decline of 2049 million this decline was primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes as customer advances were lower and inventory levels were higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 levels due to the declining pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizers in 2015 customers delayed making forward purchase commitments to purchase fertilizer in 2015 which reduced the amount of customer advances that were received as compared to 2014 when fertilizer pricing was stronger inventory levels were also higher in 2015 due to a poor fall ammonia application season as compared to 2014 when inventory levels declinednet cash used in investing activities was 298 billion in 2015 compared to 3435 million in 2014 when we received proceeds of 137 billion from the sale of the phosphate business during 2015 capital expenditures totaled 247 billion compared to 181 billion in 2014 the increase in

like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply availability and demand for these commodities natural gas pricesnatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 850 per mmbtu on february 12 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on both december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 1600 per mmbtu on march 22 2013natural gas costs including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives declined 28 in 2015 from 2014 expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 45 of our nitrogen product segments total production costs in 2015farmers economicsthe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted40table of contentscf industries holdings incglobal trade in fertilizerin addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the worldimports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north americagovernment policiesthe policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers farmers and imported or exported product due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by political and social objectivesethanol industry and the renewable fuel standardcorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states supply of fuel for transportation in addition congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not passed there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be passed into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industryfactors affecting our resultsnet sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net salescost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customerswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we often use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing costs for nitrogenbased fertilizer we report our natural gas derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of

and the 101 million decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease in nitrogen product segments gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical

to the nitrogen product segments and a 1684 million decrease due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 the remaining nitrogen product segments net sales decreased due to an 8 decline in average selling prices and a 3 decline in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices excluding the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition were 318 per ton in 2015 compared to 345 per ton in 2014 due primarily to lower uan granular urea and ammonia selling prices in 2015 as international nitrogen fertilizer prices continued to decline due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices the decline in uan average selling prices was primarily due to excess global supply granular urea exports from china were at a record high in 2015 and russian exports have increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the global supply excess and the decline in average selling prices compared to 2014 the decrease in ammonia average selling prices from prior year levels is due primarily to weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions compared to the prior year as a weak fall application season combined with higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 our total nitrogen product segments sales volume increased by 3 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 6 the remaining decline in our nitrogen product segments sales volume of 3 was due primarily to lower ammonia and uan sales volume our ammonia sales volume was lower in 2015 partly due to a poor fall application season in north america as a result of poor weather conditions in the midwest the season started late and ended early in november due to snow in

4 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 3 increase in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices declined due primarily to lower ammonia and uan selling prices compared to the prior year period ammonia prices were lower due primarily to the higher producer inventory levels that carried over from the end of 2013 as compared to the previous year as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions the decline in uan prices was due primarily to customer preferences for attractively priced ammonia during the extended spring ammonia application season in 2014 nitrogen product segments sales volume increased due primarily to increased sales of ammonia and an along with the increased sales in the other segment mainly def ammonia volume benefited in 2014 from a combination of attractive pricing compared to other forms of nitrogen fertilizer favorable weather conditions that resulted in an extended spring application season and effective utilization of our terminal and logistics system to resupply in advance of periods of high demand in addition sales to mosaic under our ammonia supply contract

partially offset by the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 total cost of sales per ton in our nitrogen product segments averaged 211 in 2014 compared to 172 in 2013 this 23 increase was due primarily to higher natural gas costs and higher other production costs total realized gas costs increased 16 natural gas costs for 2014 also included a 795 million unrealized net marktomarket loss on

at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had 1615 million and 3254 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheetswhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activityunder our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported salesderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we use

international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangementsthe isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 2113 million and 471 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral

as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method 70table of

value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated market value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of salesasset retirement obligationsasset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2015 dollars is 664 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2015 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusionrecoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiarieswe review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our reviewthe recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earningsour joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and continues to generate positive income and cash flow the financial results are included in the information in 71table of contentscf industries holdings incnote 8equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago these curtailments are expected to continue into the future commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing in 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl no impairment was recognized in 2014 or 2013 related to this investmentwe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2015 2014 or 2013 reviews as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying value of our goodwill was 239 billion and 209 billion respectivelyintangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer

estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occurincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectivelya deferred income tax

reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believe to be indefinitely reinvestedas a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of

can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns74table
