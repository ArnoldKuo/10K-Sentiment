plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading schemecanada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a signatory to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces in april 2015 ontario announced that it intended to implement its own ghg cap and trade program on november 16 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system the notice stated that ontario was proposing to commence operation of the cap and trade program by january 1 2017 and that this program would link with the cap and trade programs already in operation in california and quebec the design document further proposed that the initial cap be set at forecasted ghg emissions for 2017 with annual reductions in the cap designed to achieve the objective of reducing ontarios ghg emissions to 15 below 1990 levels by 2020 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co2 currently our medicine hat facilitys method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax is set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2016 with an emissions reduction target of 15 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 with an emissions reduction target of 20 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafterthe united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a signatory to the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our 10table of contentscf industries holdings incus production facilities are locatedlouisiana mississippi iowa and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissionsnew source performance standards for nitric acid plantswe operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gasregulatory permits and approvalswe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits the baton rouge area where our donaldsonville facility is located currently is classified as marginal nonattainment for ozone with respect to the ozone standard issued in 2008 epa has proposed reclassifying the baton rouge area as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 20122014 data however on october 26 2015 epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause baton rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment area such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvalsemployeesas of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 2800 fulltime and 100 parttime employees11table of contentscf industries holdings inc
