the united states concerning greenhouse gas ghg emissionsthe united kingdom is a party to the kyoto protocol as a result of agreements reached during a conference in durban south africa in 2011 the kyoto protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period which will expire by 2020 on december 12 2015 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading schemecanada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a signatory to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces in april 2015 ontario announced that it intended to implement its own ghg cap and trade program on november 16 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system the notice stated that ontario was proposing to commence operation of the cap and trade program by january 1 2017 and that this program would link with the cap and trade programs already in operation in california and quebec the design document further proposed that the initial cap be set at forecasted ghg emissions for 2017 with annual reductions in the cap designed to achieve the objective of reducing ontarios ghg emissions to 15 below 1990 levels by 2020 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co2 currently our medicine hat facilitys method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax is set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2016 with an emissions reduction target of 15 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 with an emissions reduction target of 20 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafterthe united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a signatory to the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states

performance standards for nitric acid plantswe operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gasregulatory permits and approvalswe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits the baton rouge area where our donaldsonville facility is located currently is classified as marginal nonattainment for ozone with respect to the ozone standard issued in 2008 epa has proposed reclassifying the baton rouge area as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 20122014 data however on october 26 2015 epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause baton rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment area such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to

realize the full benefits from the chs strategic venture that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliersour business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 330 per mmbtu on january 16 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is

2013changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows14table of contentscf industries holdings incour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiesconsolidation in the industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour competitors in russia and ukraine have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions most us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine will be under review by government agencies in the coming year and any revocation of such measures could lead to significant increases in imports from these countrieswe also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our productsconditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results our operating results are also affected by conditions in the european agricultural industry the agricultural industries in the united states and europe can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that 15table of contentscf industries holdings inchave also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for

implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to risewe may not be

predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 1 2015 the epa released a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operationsfuture regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facilitys net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter in april 2015 the province of ontario canada announced that it intends to implement a ghg cap and trade program in november 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system which notice indicated that ontario intended to commence operation of the cap and trade program effective january 1 2017 there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us20table of contentscf industries holdings incour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks 21table of contentscf industries holdings incmajor financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which currently represents approximately 35 of our ammonia production capacity and will represent approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity after the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are fully operational the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventureas of december 31 2015 our remaining joint venture is a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our businessin addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsour plnl joint venture operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments have continued into 2015 and we are unable to predict when the curtailments will cease to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl as we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future in addition failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in

regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar british pound and the euro we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through

could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted23table of contentscf industries holdings incin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investmentwe have a material amount of indebtedness expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis following consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci and may need to incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our businessas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 56 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 we had excess borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement of 19951 million in addition upon the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis we expect that this indebtedness will include our existing indebtedness approximately 12 billion of existing secured project finance indebtedness relating to the ena business and indebtedness under any of the existing oci convertible bonds assumed by us in connection with the combination in addition to fund the cash requirements in connection with the consummation of the combination we expect that we or our subsidiaries will use either cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from external sources whether using alternative financing arranged prior to the closing under the combination agreement or if such financing is not arranged a portion of the financing under our bridge credit agreement of approximately 10 billion in addition upon the consummation of the combination our bridge credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 13 billion for general corporate purposes and our existing revolving credit agreement provides for up to 20 billion of borrowings for general corporate purposesour substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures research and development and other business activities cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditionsexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our credit agreements could be at variable rates of interest make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes andresult in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe expect that the terms of our indebtedness will allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our bridge credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected24table of
