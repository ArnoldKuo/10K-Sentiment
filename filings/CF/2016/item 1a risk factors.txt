whether to invoke the applicable condition and not consummate the combination or waive the condition and consummate the combination assuming the other closing conditions are satisfied or waived accordingly any changes in applicable tax laws regulations or the underlying facts before the closing date could jeopardize or delay the combination andor have a material adverse effect on new cfs business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor share pricegovernmental or regulatory actions could delay the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement or result in the imposition of conditions that reduce the anticipated benefits from the combination or cause the parties to abandon the combinationconditions to closing the proposed combination with the ena business of oci include clearance by the committee on foreign investment in the united states and that there is no judgment temporary restraining order preliminary or permanent injunction ruling determination decision opinion or comparable judicial or regulatory action of a governmental body in effect that prohibits the combination at any time before or after the completion of the merger and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods the antitrust division and the ftc or any state attorney general could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties in addition in some circumstances a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the combination before or after it is completed we and oci may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust and competition laws we have agreed to pay oci 150 million if the combination agreement is terminated in certain circumstances if certain regulatory approvals are not obtainedwe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed combination with the ena business of oci is pending which could adversely affect our business and operations in connection with the pending combination with the ena business of oci it is possible that some customers suppliers and other persons with whom we have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the combination which could negatively affect our revenues and earnings as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the combination is completed 12table of contentscf industries holdings incunder the terms of the combination agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies these restrictions the waiver of which is subject to the consent of oci not to be unreasonably withheld could prevent us from taking certain actions that may be beneficial to our business such as making acquisitions pursuing certain business opportunities or entering into certain financing instruments such limitations could negatively affect our operations and business prior to the closingfurthermore the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the postcombination period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us the combination agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternative transactions to the combination could discourage potential alternative transactions andor third parties from making alternative transaction proposals and could require in certain circumstances that we pay a termination fee of 150 million pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement we may be required to pay a termination fee of 150 million if the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement are not consummated because of the occurrence of certain events including a change to the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the proposals related to the combination that are to be voted on by our stockholders such a fee could be payable even if no other alternative transaction is consummated in addition if the combination agreement is terminated because we fail to obtain the required approval of our stockholders we are obligated to reimburse ocis expenses up to a cap of 30 millionwe are generally prohibited from entering into an acquisition agreement with a third party soliciting an alternative proposal from any third party involving 15 or more of our common stock assets or earning power and subject to limited exceptions participating in any discussions or negotiations regarding any proposal that is or could reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative acquisition proposal or furnishing any nonpublic information in connection therewith in addition under the terms of the combination agreement we are not permitted to terminate the combination agreement if our board of directors withdraws its recommendation of the combination agreement or approves or recommends an alternative acquisition proposal and must continue in these circumstances to submit the combination agreement for consideration by our stockholders unless oci terminates the combination agreementthe presence of the above provisions and the termination fee could discourage third parties from making alternative acquisition proposals even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the proposed market value of the shares in the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement as a result third parties may make acquisition proposals if at all at a lower price than they would otherwise be willing to make in the absence of such restrictions on the ability of our board of directors to consider andor negotiate with respect to such proposals we may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring significant liability failure to complete the proposed combination with the ena business of oci or significant delays in completing the combination could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock andor our future business and financial results the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci is subject to numerous conditions which may not be satisfied in a timely manner or at all if the combination is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the combination the trading price of our common stock andor our future business and financial results could be negatively affected and we will be subject to various risks including the followingwe may be liable for damages to oci under the terms and conditions of the combination agreement negative reactions from the financial markets including declines in the price of our common stock due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the combination will be completed having to pay certain significant costs relating to the combination lost opportunities resulting from restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the transaction andthe attention of management will have been diverted to the combination rather than to current operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us13table of contentscf industries holdings incwe may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we could experience difficulty in attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees due to the uncertainty of the closing of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci in addition certain key employees of the ena business may not wish to become employees of new cf until completion of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement employee retention could be a challenge for us as employees may have uncertainty about the combination and their future roles with new cf if our employees or employees of the ena business depart prior to the closing of the combination due to uncertainty or the difficulty of integrating the two businesses new cfs ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement could be reduced or delayedwe are subject to risk associated with the chs strategic venture we may not realize the full benefits from the chs strategic venture that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliersour business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 330 per mmbtu on january 16 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 850 per mmbtu on february 12 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 1600 per mmbtu on march 22 2013changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows14table of contentscf industries holdings incour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiesconsolidation in the industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour competitors in russia and ukraine have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions most us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine will be under review by government agencies in the coming year and any revocation of such measures could lead to significant increases in imports from these countrieswe also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our productsconditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results our operating results are also affected by conditions in the european agricultural industry the agricultural industries in the united states and europe can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that 15table of contentscf industries holdings inchave also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or interruption in the delivery may adversely affect our businesswe and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers we purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by among other things severe weather or natural disasters unscheduled downtime labor difficulties insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents or mechanical failures in addition the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints leaks or ruptures any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials even for a limited period could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight this exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liabilitywe rely on railroad truck pipeline river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers we also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products these transportation operations equipment and services are subject to various hazards including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system extreme weather conditions system failures work stoppages delays accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards additionally due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges roadways rail lines river locks and equipment that our third party service providers utilize we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs maintenance or replacement activities are conducted also certain third party service providers particularly railroads have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our productsthese transportation operations equipment and services are also subject to environmental safety and regulatory oversight due to concerns related to accidents discharges or other releases of hazardous substances terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives governmental entities could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished productsif shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies failure to operate properly or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected in addition increases in our transportation costs or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsin the united states and canada the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads potential liability stemming from the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities for example various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources these initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care custody and control of the railroads for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable new regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products increases in transportation costs or changes in such costs 16table of contentscf industries holdings

and liabilitieswe maintain property business interruption casualty and liability insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to various selfretentions deductibles and limits under these insurance policies the policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder our policies are generally renewed annually as a result of market conditions our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage there can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditionsin april 2013 there was a fire and explosion at the west fertilizer co fertilizer storage and distribution facility in west texas according to published reports 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility various subsidiaries of cf industries holdings inc the cf entities have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013 2014 and 2015 in the district court of mclennan county texas by the city of west individual residents of the county and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion the cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the district court of mclennan county under the caption in re west explosion cases the twoyear statute of limitations expired on april 17 2015 as of that date over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims including at least 9 entities 325 individuals and 80 insurance companies plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence strict liability and breach of warranty under texas law although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to west fertilizer co products that the cf entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the west facility at the time of the incident the court granted in part and denied in part the cf entities motions for summary judgment in august 2015 thirtyfour cases including the three cases scheduled to begin trial on october 12 2015 and some of the ten cases scheduled to begin trial on february 1 2016 were resolved pursuant to confidential settlements fully funded by insurance the remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pretrial proceedings these cases will be set for trial in the upcoming months at the discretion of the court we believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the cf entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits the increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilitiescyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating resultswe rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions and plant operations business and supply chain disruptions plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations

unintended disclosure of confidential information the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems and breaches due to employee error our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business we have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to cyber attacks we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate however we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate prevent or recover from rapidly evolving 17table of contentscf industries holdings inctypes of cyber attacks compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to risewe may not be

we may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions the risks of any expansion of our business through investments acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to

january 1 2017 there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us20table of contentscf industries holdings incour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks 21table of contentscf industries holdings incmajor financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which currently represents approximately 35 of our ammonia production capacity and will represent approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity after the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are fully operational the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventureas of december 31 2015 our remaining joint venture is a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our businessin addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsour plnl joint venture operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments have continued into 2015 and we are unable to predict when the curtailments will cease to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl as we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future in addition failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsdue to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives we are subject to various security laws and regulations in the united states these security laws include the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and the chemical facilities antiterrorism standards regulation in addition president obama issued executive order 13650 improving chemical facility safety and security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers these regulations could result in higher operating costs or 22table of contentscf industries holdings inclimitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs lower revenues and reduced profit margins we manufacture and sell certain nitrogen fertilizers that can be used as explosives it is possible that governmental entities in the united states or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use sale or distribution of nitrogen fertilizers thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for uswe are subject to risks associated with international operationsour international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations unexpected changes in regulatory environments currency fluctuations tax rates that may exceed those in the united states earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions our principal reporting currency is the us dollar and our business operations and investments outside the united states increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the canadian dollar british pound and the euro we may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by among other things requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in or indexed to the us dollar or a currency freely convertible into us dollars or hedging through foreign currency derivatives these efforts however may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions including the us foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and economic sanctions programs administered by the united nations the european union and the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and regulations set forth under the comprehensive iran accountability divestment act as a result of doing business internationally we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we our partners or agents operate violations of anticorruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment the violation of applicable laws by our employees consultants agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of

persistent weakness in economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers reluctance to replenish inventories the overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted23table of contentscf industries holdings incin addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investmentwe have a material amount of indebtedness expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis following consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci and may need to incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our businessas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 56 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 we had excess borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement of 19951 million in addition upon the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis we expect that this indebtedness will include our existing indebtedness approximately 12 billion of existing secured project finance indebtedness relating to the ena business and indebtedness under any of the existing oci convertible bonds assumed by us in connection with the combination in addition to fund the cash requirements in connection with the consummation of the combination we expect that we or our subsidiaries will use either cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from external sources whether using alternative financing arranged prior to the closing under the combination agreement or if such financing is not arranged a portion of the financing under our bridge credit agreement of approximately 10 billion in addition upon the consummation of the combination our bridge credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 13 billion for general corporate purposes and our existing revolving credit agreement provides for up to 20 billion of borrowings for general corporate purposesour substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures research and development and other business activities cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditionsexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our credit agreements could be at variable rates of interest make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes andresult in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe expect that the terms of our indebtedness will allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the holders of our outstanding debt securities the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and our bridge credit agreement and our suppliers may be materially and adversely affected24table of
