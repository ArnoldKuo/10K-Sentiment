preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 15c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate the united kingdom has adopted ghg emissions regulations including regulations to implement the european union greenhouse gas trading system our uk manufacturing plants are required to report ghg emissions annually to the united kingdom environment agency pursuant to their site environmental permits and climate change agreement which specify energy efficiency targets failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase co2 emissions allowances the steam boilers at each of our uk sites are also subject to the european union emissions trading schemecanada withdrew from further participation in the kyoto protocol in december 2011 but is a signatory to the paris agreement in canada we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with environment canadas national pollutant release inventory and ontarios mandatory monitoring and reporting regulation and the ghg reporting regulation ontario is party to the western climate initiative wci comprising california and several canadian provinces in april 2015 ontario announced that it intended to implement its own ghg cap and trade program on november 16 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system the notice stated that ontario was proposing to commence operation of the cap and trade program by january 1 2017 and that this program would link with the cap and trade programs already in operation in california and quebec the design document further proposed that the initial cap be set at forecasted ghg emissions for 2017 with annual reductions in the cap designed to achieve the objective of reducing ontarios ghg emissions to 15 below 1990 levels by 2020 in alberta the specified gas emitters regulation ghg regulation was implemented in 2007 this program requires facilities emitting more than 100000 tons of ghgs per year to reduce emissions by 12 over such facilities 2007 levels to meet this requirement companies can reduce emissions purchaseuse offset credits or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of 15 per ton of co2 currently our medicine hat facilitys method of compliance is to make contributions to the technology fund alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax is set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2016 with an emissions reduction target of 15 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 with an emissions reduction target of 20 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafterthe united states is not a party to the kyoto protocol but is a signatory to the paris agreement in the united states ghg regulation is evolving at state regional and federal levels although some of the more significant developments to date including epas clean power plan do not directly impose obligations on our facilities the epa has issued a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required all of our us manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january 1 2010 and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in 2011 in addition if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd construction permit applicable to such facilities we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects other than the states implementation of this permitting requirement none of the states where our 10table of contentscf industries holdings incus production facilities are locatedlouisiana mississippi iowa and oklahomahas proposed control regulations limiting ghg emissionsnew source performance standards for nitric acid plantswe operate 13 nitric acid plants in the united states on august 14 2012 the epa issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the epa regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gasregulatory permits and approvalswe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals more stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits the baton rouge area where our donaldsonville facility is located currently is classified as marginal nonattainment for ozone with respect to the ozone standard issued in 2008 epa has proposed reclassifying the baton rouge area as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 20122014 data however on october 26 2015 epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause baton rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment area such a classification in the baton rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions or could make it difficult to obtain such approvalsemployeesas of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 2800 fulltime and 100 parttime employees11table of contentscf industries holdings incitem 1a risk factors in addition to

andor third parties from making alternative transaction proposals and could require in certain circumstances that we pay a termination fee of 150 million pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement we may be required to pay a termination fee of 150 million if the transactions contemplated by the combination agreement are not consummated because of the occurrence of certain events including a change to the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to the proposals related to the combination that are to be voted on by our stockholders such a fee could be payable even

realize the full benefits from the chs strategic venture that are expected the realization of the expected benefits of the chs strategic venture depends on our ability to successfully operate and manage the strategic venture and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with chs over the life of the agreement among other factors additionally any challenges related to the chs strategic venture could harm our relationships with our customers employees or suppliersour business is dependent on natural gas the prices of which are subject to volatilitynatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada north american natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products the price of natural gas in north america has been volatile in recent years during 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub the most heavilytraded natural gas pricing point in north america reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 330 per mmbtu on january 16 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 850 per mmbtu on february 12 2015

2013changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices if high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsthe price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could rise which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows14table of contentscf industries holdings incour business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affectedhistorically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply demand balanceperiods of high demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in investment in production capacity which may cause supply to exceed demand and selling prices and capacity utilization to decline future growth in demand for fertilizer may not be sufficient to absorb excess industry capacityduring periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of productionour products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producerswe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entitiesconsolidation in the industry has increased the resources of several of our competitors some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnershipschina the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers is expected to continue expanding its fertilizer production capacity in the medium term if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage exports this expected increase in capacity could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsour competitors in russia and ukraine have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity and continue to benefit from nonmarket pricing of natural gas which allows them to increase exports at aggressive prices depending on market conditions most us antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from russia and ukraine will be under review by government agencies in the coming year and any revocation of such measures could lead to significant increases in imports from these countrieswe also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the middle east europe and latin america who depending on market conditions fluctuating input prices geographic location and freight economics may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsa decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our productsconditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results our operating results are also affected by conditions in the european agricultural industry the agricultural industries in the united states and europe can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our controlgovernmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that 15table of contentscf industries holdings inchave also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for

implications adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operationsweather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following growing season resulting in lower demand for our productsadverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patternsweather conditions or in certain cases weather forecasts also can affect the price of natural gas the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use which can increase the cost andor decrease the availability of natural gas in addition adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freezeoffs or hurricanes affecting the gulf of mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to risewe may not be

adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows on october 1 2015 the epa released a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operationsfuture regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to ghg regulations in the united kingdom canada and the united states in the united states our existing facilities currently are only subject to ghg emissions reporting obligations although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to ghg emissions standards included in their air permits our facilities in the united kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset ghg emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program our facility in alberta canada is subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facilitys net emissions intensity which can be met by facility improvements the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits or contributions to a nonprofit climate change fund established by alberta alberta has recently announced that it is replacing its current approach with respect to carbon by introducing a carbon tax that applies across all sectors the carbon tax will be set at 20 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2017 rise to 30 per ton canadian dollars effective january 1 2018 and increase with the rate of inflation thereafter in april 2015 the province of ontario canada announced that it intends to implement a ghg cap and trade program in november 2015 ontario published a notice seeking comments on the design of its cap and trade system which notice indicated that ontario intended to commence operation of the cap and trade program effective january 1 2017 there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future ghg regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials or transportation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states canada or the united kingdom our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us20table of contentscf industries holdings incour operating results fluctuate due to seasonality our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory potentially at costs in excess of market value or product shortages the fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting seasonif seasonal demand is less than we expect we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs or liquidated in which case the selling price may be below our production procurement and storage costs the risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers if prices for our products rapidly decrease we may be subject to inventory writedowns adversely affecting our operating results if seasonal demand is greater than we expect we may experience product shortages and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from usa change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose under our forward sales programs customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assetsany cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped which can take up to several months we believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources in periods of rising fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis conversely in periods of declining fertilizer prices selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis in addition fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipmentour business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losseswe often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges in order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates from time to time we may use foreign currency derivatives primarily forward exchange contracts our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidityhedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks 21table of contentscf industries holdings incmajor financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instrumentswe are reliant on a limited number of key facilitiesour nitrogen fertilizer operations are concentrated in nine separate nitrogen complexes the largest of which is the donaldsonville complex which currently represents approximately 35 of our ammonia production capacity and will represent approximately 40 of our ammonia production capacity after the donaldsonville and port neal capacity expansion projects are fully operational the suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition our donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the united states that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane activity and our other complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather such storms depending on their severity and location have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the supply and price of natural gas in the respective regions moreover our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptionswe are exposed to risks associated with our joint ventureas of december 31 2015 our remaining joint venture is a 50 ownership interest in plnl which owns a facility in the republic of trinidad and tobago our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our plnl joint venture as a result our investment in our plnl joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently these risks include the possibility that our plnl joint venture or our partner have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals are in a position to take action contrary to or have veto rights over our instructions requests policies or objectives subject our plnl joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated take actions that reduce our return on investment or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our businessin addition we may become involved in disputes with our plnl joint venture partner which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture which could reduce our revenues or increase our costsour plnl joint venture operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in trinidad these curtailments have continued into 2015 and we are unable to predict when the curtailments will cease to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl as we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future in addition failure to secure a longterm gas supply from ngc on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture which could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our businesslike other companies with major industrial facilities we may be targets of terrorist activities many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled any damage to infrastructure facilities such as electric generation transmission and distribution facilities or injury to employees who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism may affect our operations any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in

cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investmentwe have a material amount of indebtedness expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis following consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci and may need to incur additional indebtedness or need to refinance existing indebtedness in the future which may adversely affect our businessas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 56 billion of total funded indebtedness consisting primarily of senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2018 and 2044 we had excess borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement of 19951 million in addition upon the consummation of the proposed combination with the ena business of oci we expect to have a substantial amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis we expect that this indebtedness will include our existing indebtedness approximately 12 billion of existing secured project finance indebtedness relating to the ena business and indebtedness under any of the existing oci convertible bonds assumed by us in connection with the combination in addition to fund the cash requirements in connection with the consummation of the combination we expect that we or our subsidiaries will use either cash on hand or a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from external sources whether using alternative financing arranged prior to the closing under the combination agreement or if such financing is not arranged a portion of the financing under our bridge credit agreement of approximately 10 billion in addition upon the consummation of the combination our bridge credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 13 billion for general corporate purposes and our existing revolving credit agreement provides for up to 20 billion of borrowings for general corporate purposesour substantial debt service obligations could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows our substantial indebtedness could as a result of our debt service obligation or through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise have important consequences for example it couldmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures research and development and other business activities cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditionsexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our credit agreements could be at variable rates of interest make us more leveraged than some of our competitors which could place us at a competitive disadvantage limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes andresult in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings we expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time our ability to obtain any financing whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise and the terms of any such financing are dependent on among other things our financial condition financial market conditions within our industry and generally credit ratings and numerous other factors including factors beyond our control consequently in the event that we need to access the credit markets including to refinance our debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe if at all an inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe expect that the terms of our indebtedness will allow us to incur significant additional debt in the future if we incur additional indebtedness the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify if our financial condition or operating results deteriorate our relations with our creditors including the

agreements and preparing for the proposed combination with the ena business of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by usphosphate business dispositionon march 17 2014 we sold our phosphate mining and manufacturing business and recognized pretax and aftertax gains on the sale of the phosphate business of 7501 million and 4628 million respectively under the terms of the definitive transaction agreement the accounts receivable and accounts payable pertaining to the phosphate mining and manufacturing business and certain phosphate inventory held in distribution facilities were not sold to mosaic in the transaction and were settled in the ordinary courseupon selling the phosphate business we began to supply mosaic with ammonia produced by our plnl joint venture the contract to supply ammonia to mosaic from our plnl joint venture represents the continuation of a supply practice that previously existed between our former phosphate mining and manufacturing business and other operations of the company prior to march 17 2014 plnl sold ammonia to us for use in the phosphate business and the cost was included in our production costs in our phosphate segment subsequent to the sale of the phosphate business we now sell the plnlsourced ammonia to mosaic the revenue from these sales to mosaic and the costs to purchase the ammonia from plnl are now included in our ammonia segment our 50 share of the operating results of our plnl joint venture continues to be included in our equity in earnings of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations because of the significance of this continuing supply practice in accordance with us gaap the phosphate mining and manufacturing business is not reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operationsthe phosphate segment reflects the reported results of the phosphate business through march 17 2014 plus the continuing sales of the phosphate inventory in the distribution network after march 17 2014 the remaining phosphate inventory was sold in the second quarter of 2014 therefore the phosphate segment does not have operating results subsequent to that quarter however the segment will continue to be included until the reporting of comparable period phosphate results ceasesimpairment of our investment in plnlin 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl in the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in plnl exceeded its fair value this was primarily due to the ongoing natural gas curtailments impacting the results of operations of plnl and the expectation that these curtailments will continue into the future our plnl joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability

which they would benefit should any of the preipo nols be realized in future years by using the nols to offset postipo taxable income if this were to occur we would pay the preipo owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved as of december 31 2012 the nols had a potential tax benefit of 943 million which had been fully reserved by the valuation allowancein

6904 million or 50 the 2014 reported results were significantly impacted by the sale of our phosphate business in the first quarter of 2014 we sold the phosphate business and recognized a pretax gain of 7501 million 4628 million after tax on the sale of this business diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 45 to 296 per share in 2015 from 542 per share in 2014 this decrease is due to lower net earnings partly offset by the lower diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding in 2015 as compared to the prior year during 2015 we repurchased 89 million shares of our common stock representing 4 of the prior year end outstanding shares at a cost of 5272 millionin 2015 our total gross margin declined by 2314 million or 13 to 155 billion in 2015 from 178 billion in 2014 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased gross margin by 235 million the remaining decline in our gross margin of 2549 million or 14 was due to the 2448 million decrease in gross margin in the nitrogen product segments and the 101 million decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease in nitrogen product segments gross margin as more fully described below was due primarily to lower average selling prices lower sales volume and the impact of marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives partially offset by lower physical natural gas costsaverage selling prices primarily uan and granular urea decreased by 8 which reduced gross margin by 3488 million as international nitrogen fertilizer prices continued to decline due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices sales volume primarily ammonia decreased by 3 which decreased gross margin by 723 million due primarily to a poor fall application season and weaker demand as customers were unable to apply ammonia due to poor weather conditions and customers were hesitant to buy in a declining pricing environment unrealized net marktomarket losses on natural gas derivatives decreased gross margin by 968 million as 2015 included a 1763 million loss compared to 795 million loss in 2014 lower physical natural gas costs in 2015 partially offset by the impact of natural gas derivatives that settled in the period increased gross margin by 2298 million compared to 2014 lower gas costs were primarily driven by increased north american natural gas production as increased well efficiencies increased supply warm weather conditions especially in the fourth quarter also contributed to high storage levels and the resulting decline in gas prices selling general and administrative expenses increased 179 million to 1698 million in 2015 from 1519 million in 2014 the increase was due primarily to the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition an increase in corporate project activities and higher intangible amortization coststransaction costs incurred in 2015 of 569 million are attributable to various consulting and legal services associated primarily with executing the strategic agreements and preparing for the proposed combination with the ena business of oci our strategic venture with chs and our acquisition of the remaining 50 equity interest in cf fertilisers uk not previously owned by us other operatingnet increased by 390 million from 533 million of expense in 2014 to expense of 923 million in 2015 the increased expense was due primarily to increased expansion project costs pertaining to our donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization compared to 2014net interest expense decreased by 457 million to 1316 million in 2015 from 1773 million in 2014 due primarily to the higher amounts of capitalized interest related to our capacity expansion projects partially offset by higher interest expense pertaining to the 10 billion and 15 billion of senior notes that were issued in september 2015 and 38table of

2014net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was 120 billion as compared to 141 billion in 2014 a decline of 2049 million this decline was primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes as customer advances were lower and inventory levels were higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 levels due to the declining pricing environment for nitrogen fertilizers in 2015 customers delayed making forward purchase commitments to purchase fertilizer in 2015 which reduced the amount of customer advances that were received as compared to 2014 when fertilizer pricing was stronger inventory levels

39table of contentscf industries holdings inckey industry factorswe operate in a highly competitive global industry our products are globallytraded commodities and as a result we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality moreover our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors including those outlined belowglobal supply amp demandhistorically global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates among other things we expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on longterm fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future shortterm fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions weather patterns the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption governmental regulations including requirements mandating increased use of biofuels and farm sector income other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buyingselling patterns of key exportingconsuming countries such as china india and brazil among others often play a major role in shaping nearterm market fundamentals the economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal supply costs are affected by the supply availability and demand for these commodities natural gas pricesnatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers we use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia granular urea uan an and other nitrogen products because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the united states and canada the price of natural gas in north america directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations natural gas prices in north america declined over the past several years but are subject to volatility during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at the henry hub reached a low of 154 per mmbtu on four consecutive days in december 2015 and a high of 794 per mmbtu on march 5 2014we also have manufacturing facilities located in the united kingdom these facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in europe the major natural gas trading point for the united kingdom is the national balancing point nbp during 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 850 per mmbtu on february 12 2015 during the three year period ended december 31 2015 the daily closing price at nbp reached a low of 460 per mmbtu on both december 23 2015 and december 24 2015 and a high of 1600 per mmbtu on march 22 2013natural gas costs including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives declined 28 in 2015 from 2014 expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs for example natural gas costs including realized gains and losses comprised approximately 45 of our nitrogen product segments total production costs in 2015farmers economicsthe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity soil conditions weather patterns crop prices and the types of crops planted40table of contentscf industries holdings incglobal trade in fertilizerin addition to the relationship between global supply and demand profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supplydemand balance within that region regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product relative currency values the availability of credit and governmental trade policies the development of additional natural gas reserves in north america over the last few years has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world making north american nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive these lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in north america including our capacity expansion projects in donaldsonville louisiana and port neal iowa changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the worldimports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in north america producers of nitrogenbased fertilizers located in the middle east ukraine the republic of trinidad and tobago venezuela north africa russia and china are major exporters to north americagovernment policiesthe policies of governments around the world can result in restrictions on imports and exports the subsidization of natural gas prices and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers farmers and imported or exported product due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by political and social objectivesethanol industry and the renewable fuel standardcorn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38 of total us corn demand us government policy as expressed in the renewable fuel standard rfs is a major determinant for the ethanol market the rfs establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels including ethanol that must be included in the united states supply of fuel for transportation in addition congress at various times has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the rfs while past legislation proposing changes to the rfs has not passed there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be passed into law other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol gasoline and corn lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industryfactors affecting our resultsnet sales our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize the volumes mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net salescost of sales our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs purchased product costs and distribution costs manufacturing costs the most significant element of cost of sales consist primarily of raw materials realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments maintenance direct labor depreciation and other plant overhead expenses purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customerswe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose as our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us we often use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in the cost of natural gas the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing costs for nitrogenbased fertilizer we report our natural gas derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur see forward sales and customer advances later in this discussion and analysis as a result of fixing the selling prices of our products often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment volatility in quarterly reported earnings also may arise from the unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the value of

and the 101 million decline in gross margin in the phosphate segment as the phosphate business was sold in the first quarter of 2014 the remaining decrease in nitrogen product segments gross margin as

to the nitrogen product segments and a 1684 million decrease due to the sale of the phosphate business in march 2014 the remaining nitrogen product segments net sales decreased due to an 8 decline in average selling prices and a 3 decline in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices excluding the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition were 318 per ton in 2015 compared to 345 per ton in 2014 due primarily to lower uan granular urea and ammonia selling prices in 2015 as international nitrogen fertilizer prices continued to decline due to excess global supply the combination of falling global production costs foreign currency devaluation and reduced ocean freight costs allowed many international producers to continue operations and the resulting supply weighed on global prices the decline in uan average selling prices was primarily due to excess global supply granular urea exports from china were at a record high in 2015 and russian exports have increased significantly while global capacity additions in 2015 further contributed to the global supply excess and the decline in average selling prices compared to 2014 the decrease in ammonia average selling prices from prior year levels is due primarily to weaker nitrogen fertilizer market conditions compared to the prior year as a weak fall application season combined with higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 our total nitrogen product segments sales volume increased by 3 the impact of the cf fertilisers uk acquisition increased our sales volume by 6 the remaining decline in our nitrogen product segments sales volume of 3 was due primarily to lower ammonia and uan sales volume our ammonia sales volume was lower in 2015 partly due to a poor fall application season in north america as a result of poor weather conditions in the midwest the season started late and ended early in november due to snow in

modifications in 2013 on an as adjusted basis the 2014 net sales decreased 14 compared to 2013 the 7315 million decrease in net sales is attributable to a 1030 million decrease in the nitrogen product

4 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 3 increase in sales volume nitrogen product segments average selling prices declined due primarily to lower ammonia and uan selling prices compared to the prior year period ammonia prices were lower due primarily to the higher producer inventory levels that carried over from the end of 2013 as compared to the previous year as a result of the shortened 2013 fall ammonia application season caused by cold weather conditions the decline in uan prices was due primarily to customer preferences for attractively priced ammonia during the extended spring ammonia application season in 2014 nitrogen product segments sales volume increased due primarily to increased sales of ammonia and an along with the increased sales in the other segment mainly def ammonia volume benefited in 2014 from a combination of attractive pricing compared to other forms of nitrogen fertilizer favorable weather conditions that resulted in an extended

higher producer inventory levels and slowing demand from phosphate fertilizer producers weighed on prices at the end of 2015 at the end of 2014 the pricing environment was stronger due to a tighter supply after the strong north american 2014 spring season and a higher level of global production outages in 2014 sales volumes are lower in 2015 due to the weak fall application season in north

at prices and on delivery dates we propose therefore our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment customer advances which typically represent a portion of the contracts sales value are received shortly after the contract is executed with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had 1615 million and 3254 million respectively in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheetswhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers outlook of future market fundamentals if the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future our cash received from customer advances could likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase additionally borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could become necessary due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activityunder our forward sales programs a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors these delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported salesderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future natural gas is the largest and most volatile

international swaps and derivatives association isda master netting arrangementsthe isda master netting arrangements to most of our derivative instruments contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 2113 million and 471 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral

as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method 70table of

value this review process incorporates current industry and customerspecific trends current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated market value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of salesasset retirement obligationsasset retirement obligations aros are legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2015 dollars is 664 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2015 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusionrecoverability of longlived assets goodwill and investments in unconsolidated subsidiarieswe review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets including our finitelived intangible assets goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating rates operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates tax rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill longlived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our reviewthe recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for goodwill impairment tests are required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value and the reduction in value is other than temporary the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earningsour joint venture investment in the republic of trinidad and tobago operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method and continues to generate positive income and cash flow the financial results are included in the information in 71table of contentscf industries holdings incnote 8equity method investments to the consolidated financial statements the joint venture has experienced natural gas curtailments in 2015 and 2014 due to major maintenance activities being conducted at upstream natural gas facilities and decreased gas exploration and development activity in the republic of trinidad and tobago these curtailments are expected to continue into the future commitments from ngc regarding the level of future availability and the related cost are not available the future availability and cost of natural gas represents a significant assumption in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing in 2015 our equity in earnings of operating affiliates includes a 619 million impairment of our equity method investment in plnl no impairment was recognized in 2014 or 2013 related to this investmentwe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value we identified no goodwill impairment in our 2015 2014 or 2013 reviews as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying value of our goodwill was 239 billion and 209 billion respectivelyintangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of terra industries inc consist of customer

estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions us income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us and be taxable the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits the judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations we adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occurincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods a valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense respectivelya deferred income tax

reinvested no deferred income tax liability is recorded for the remainder of our investment in nonus subsidiaries and joint venture which we believe to be indefinitely reinvestedas a large commercial enterprise with international operations our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors the most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation changes in the geographic mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses and the portion of the income of

potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions this amount represents our best estimate of the amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions differences in interpretation of the tax laws including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimatespension assets and liabilitiespension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets plan design actuarial estimates and discount rates actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation pbo are discount rates and in addition for our united kingdom plans an adjusted retail price index rpi key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates the expected longterm rate of return on assets and in addition for our united kingdom plans rpi  the december 31 2015 pbo was computed based on a weightedaverage discount rates of 43 for our north america plans and 38 for our united kingdom plans which were based on yields for highquality aa rated or better fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of december 31 declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pbo the weightedaverage discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2015 was 40 for north america plans and 37 for united kingdom plans our net benefit obligation after deduction of plan assets could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate the 48 weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2015 for our north america plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and nonequity investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods the 54 weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return on assets used to calculate pension expense in 2015 for our united kingdom plans is based on expected longterm performance of underlying investments net of investment managers fees the 31 rpi used to calculate our united kingdom plan pbo and pension expense is developed using the bank of england implied retail price inflation curve based on the difference between yields on fixed interest and indexlinked gilts adjusted for inflation risk  for north america qualified pension plans our pbo was 7358 million as of december 31 2015 which was 1092 million higher than pension plan assets if the discount rate used to compute the pbo for north america plans was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 461 million higher or 418 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed if the discount rate used to compute the 2015 pension expense for north america plans decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been approximately 35 million higher or 28 million lower respectively than the amount calculated if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for north america plans was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2015 would have been 30 million lower or higher respectively for our united kingdom pension plans our pbo was 5627 million as of december 31 2015 which was 1487 million higher than pension plan assets if the discount rate used to compute the united kingdom pbo was lower or higher by 50 basis points our pbo would have been 470 million higher or 429 million lower respectively than the amount previously discussed if the discount rate used to compute the 2015 united kingdom pension expense decreased or increased by 50 basis points the expense would have been 05 million lower or higher respectively if the expected longterm rate of return on assets for our united kingdom plans was higher or lower by 50 basis points pension expense for 2015 would have been 08 million lower or higher respectively if rpi was higher or lower by 50 basis points our pbo for united kingdom plans would have been 283 million

item 8 of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncementsdiscussion of seasonality impacts on operationsthe fertilizer business is seasonal the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns74table

exchange ratescommodity pricesour net sales cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogenbased fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged a 100 per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia granular urea uan 32 and an by approximately 32 22 14 and 15 respectivelynatural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through december 2018 the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options these derivatives settle using primarily nymex futures price indexes which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periodsas of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had open derivative contracts for 4315 million mmbtus and 587 million mmbtus respectively a 100 per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of december 31 2015 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of 407 million and a 100 per mmbtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by 407 millionfrom time to

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level which in our case are the ammonia granular urea uan an and other segments our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value if after performing the qualitative assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill then no further testing is performed however if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill we use an incomebased valuation method determining the present value of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary the second step of the goodwill impairment test if needed compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair valueour intangible assets are presented

obligation and are a combination of us and nonus total stock market index mutual funds the nonequity investments consist primarily of investments in debt securities and money market instruments that are selected based on investment quality and duration to mitigate volatility of the funded status and annual required contributions the nonequity investments have a duration profile that is similar to the benefit obligation in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the funded status this investment strategy is achieved through the use of mutual funds and individual securitiesthe

quarterly basis to review and discuss fund performance and other administrative matters the trustees investment objectives are to hold assets that will achieve returns in excess of expected returns used in the valuation of each plans liability without exposing the plans to unacceptable risk this is accomplished through the asset allocation strategy of each plan for both plans if the asset allocation moves more than plus or minus 5 from the benchmark allocation the trustees may decide to amend the asset allocation at a minimum the trustees review the investment strategy and every triennial actuarial valuation to ensure that the strategy remains consistent with its funding principles the trustees may review the strategy more frequently if opportunities arise to reduce risk

use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange ratescommodity price risk managementnatural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased products we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through the end of 2018 the derivatives that we use are primarily fixed price swaps and options traded in the otc markets these natural gas derivatives settle using primarily a nymex futures price index which represents the basis for fair value at any given time we entered into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to natural gas to be consumed by us in the future and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting as a result changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earningsas of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 4315 million mmbtus and 587 million mmbtus respectively for the year ended december 31 2015 we used derivatives to cover approximately 64 of our natural gas consumptionforeign currency exchange ratesin the fourth quarter of 2012 our board of directors authorized a project to construct new ammonia and ureauan plants at our donaldsonville louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our port neal iowa complex a portion of the capacity expansion project costs are eurodenominated in order to manage our exposure to changes in the euro to us dollar currency exchange rates we have hedged our projected eurodenominated payments through the third quarter of 2016 using foreign currency forward contracts as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the notional amount of our open foreign currency derivatives was 890 million and 2090 million respectively none of these open foreign currency derivatives were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes during the year ended december 31 2014 we reclassified a pretax gain of 28 million from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to income as a result of the discontinuance of certain foreign currency derivatives which were originally designated as cash flow hedges no reclassification from aoci to income occurred in 2015 or 2013 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 aoci includes 74 million of pretax gains related to the foreign currency derivatives that were originally designated as cash flow hedges the hedges were dedesignated as of december 31 2013 and the remaining balance in aoci will be reclassified into income over the depreciable lives of the property plant and equipment associated with the capacity expansion projects we expect that the amounts to be reclassified within the next twelve months will be insignificant see note 18stockholders equity for further information the effect of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations is

derivatives  06 05   2113 484the counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions and large energy companies our derivatives are executed with several counterparties generally under international swaps and derivatives association isda agreements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for otc derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement these rights are described further belowsettlement netting generally allows us and our counterparties to net into a single net payable or receivable ordinary settlement obligations arising between us under the isda agreement on the same day in the same currency for the same types of derivative instruments and through the same pairing of offices119table of contentscf industries holdings inccloseout netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event as defined in the isda agreements including bankruptcy depending on the cause of early termination the nondefaulting party may elect to terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the isda agreement the values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the isda agreement are netted resulting in a single net closeout amount payable to or by the nondefaulting party termination values may be determined using a marktomarket approach or based on a partys good faith estimate of its loss if the final net closeout amount is payable by the nondefaulting party that partys obligation to make the payment may be conditioned on factors such as the termination of all derivative transactions between the parties or payment in full of all of the defaulting partys obligations to the nondefaulting party in each case regardless of whether arising under the isda agreement or otherwisesetoff rights are provided by certain of our isda agreements and generally allow a nondefaulting party to elect to set off against the final net closeout payment other matured and contingent amounts payable between us and our counterparties under the isda agreement or otherwise typically these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an isda agreement following a default or specified termination eventmost of our isda agreements contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was 2113 million and 471 million respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates at both december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our isda agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the isda agreements upon the occurrence of a

louisiana that as of 2005 was designated as being in severe nonattainment with respect to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone the 1hour ozone standard pursuant to the federal clean air act the act section 185 of the act requires states in their state implementation plans to levy a fee section 185 fee on major stationary sources such as the donaldsonville complex located in a severe nonattainment area that did not meet the 1hour ozone standard by november 30 2005 the fee was to be assessed for each calendar year beginning in 2006 until the area achieved compliance with the ozone naaqsprior to the imposition of section 185 fees the environmental protection agency epa adopted a new ozone standard the 8hour ozone standard and rescinded the 1hour ozone standard the baton rouge area was designated as a moderate nonattainment area with respect to the 8hour ozone standard however because section 185 fees had never been assessed prior to the rescission of the 1hour ozone standard rescinded prior to the november 30 2005 ozone attainment deadline the epa concluded in a 2004 rulemaking implementing the 8hour ozone standard that the act did not require states to assess section 185 fees as a result section 185 fees were not assessed against us and other companies located in the baton rouge areain 2006 the federal dc circuit court of appeals rejected the epas position and held that section 185 fees were controls that must be maintained and fees should have been assessed under the act in january 2008 the us supreme court declined to accept the case for review making the appellate courts decision final130table of contentscf industries holdings incin july 2011 the epa approved a revision to louisianas air pollution program that eliminated the requirement for baton rouge area companies to pay section 185 fees based on baton rouges ultimate attainment of the 1hour standard through permanent and enforceable emissions reductions epas approval of the louisiana air program revision became effective on august 8 2011 however a recent decision by the federal dc circuit court of appeals struck down a similar but perhaps distinguishable epa guidance document regarding alternatives to section 185 fees at this time the viability of epas approval of louisianas elimination of section 185 fees is uncertain regardless of the approach ultimately adopted by the epa we expect that it is likely to be challenged by the environmental community the states andor affected industries therefore the costs associated with compliance with the act cannot be determined at this time and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsfurthermore the area has seen significant reductions in ozone levels attributable to federal and state regulations and community involvement ozone design values computed for the baton rouge nonattainment area suggest the area has achieved attainment with the 2008 8hour ozone standard on august 27 2015 epa proposed reclassifying the baton rouge nonattainment area for ozone as in attainment with the 2008 ozone standard based on 20122014 data epa has not yet finalized this reclassification however on october 26 2015 epa published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone that could cause baton rouge to again be classified as a nonattainment areaclean air act information requeston february 26 2009 we received a letter from the epa under section 114 of the act requesting information and copies of records

longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets aros are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value we have aros at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations these aros include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals waste materials structures equipment vessels piping and storage tanks also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds a liability has not been recorded for these conditional aros the most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these aros expressed in 2015 dollars is 664 million we have not recorded a liability for these conditional aros as of december 31 2015 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in
