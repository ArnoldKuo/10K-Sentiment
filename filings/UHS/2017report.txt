section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our mission our mission and objective is to provide superior quality healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends physicians prefer for their patients purchasers select for their clients employees are proud of and investors seek for longterm returns to achieve this we have a commitment to          service excellence          continuous improvement in measurable ways          employee development          ethical and fair treatment of all          teamwork          compassion          innovation in service delivery business strategy we believe communitybased hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of selfdetermination for both the company and our hospitals acquisition of additional hospitals we selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities we are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities we also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy improvement of operations of existing hospitals and services we also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services improvement of existing services physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls we are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities from time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need or cons although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts quality and efficiency of services pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible we are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services in addition in response to cost    2  containment pressures we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures in addition we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients physicians employees communities and our stockholders in addition our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities hospital utilization we believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility generally we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services level of technology emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions market penetration of managed care programs the degree of outpatient use the availability of reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice medical technology and pharmacology current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors we are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate in addition hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first

service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care a hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons including lack of demand incomplete construction and anticipation of future needs     2  patient days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient     3  occupancy rate is calculated by dividing average patient days total patient days divided by the total number of days in the period by the number of average beds either available

under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssources of revenue for additional disclosure other information related to our revenues income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements segment reporting regulation and other factors overview the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation requirements various licensure and accreditations reimbursement for patient services health information privacy and security rules and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse provisions including but not limited to federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources false claims submitted to federal health care programs and selfreferrals by physicians providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to significant fines or penalties andor required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions or that we would not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties if so subjected even if we were to ultimately prevail a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us licensing certification and accreditation all of our us hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal state and local statutes and regulations in the us and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care equipment and cleanliness our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal state and local health agencies as well as the requirements of municipal building codes health codes and local fire departments various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment our facilities in the united kingdom are also subject to various laws and regulations  all of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the joint commission all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers in the us are certified as providers of medicare and medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities if any of our facilities were to lose its joint commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and medicaid programs the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs and other payors we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal state local and independent review body regulations and standards the requirements for licensure certification and accreditation are subject to change and in order to remain qualified it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel and services in the future which could have a material adverse impact on operations certificates of need many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition expansion or replacement the imposition of civil or in some cases criminal sanctions the inability to receive medicare or medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facilitys license which could harm our business in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a health care facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of notforprofit hospitals utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services the law and regulations require peer review    4  organizations pros to review the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges the quality of care provided the validity of diagnosis related group drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay pros may deny payment for services provided assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the pro be excluded from participating in the medicare program we have contracted with pros in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews audits most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of medicare and medicaid program submitted claims if these audits identify overpayments we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights the federal government contracts with thirdparty recovery audit contractors racs and medicaid integrity contractors mics on a contingent fee basis to audit the propriety of payments to medicare and medicaid providers the recovery audit prepayment review demonstration program will enable racs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all medicare payment rules currently the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud and errorprone providers similarly medicare zone program integrity contractors zpics target claims for potential fraud and abuse additionally medicare administrative contractors macs must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced its intent to consolidate many of these medicare and medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors upics though it remains unclear what effect if any this proposed consolidation may have we have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations however potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves and any excess could potentially be substantial further medicare and medicaid regulations also provide for withholding medicare and medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances which could adversely affect our cash flow selfreferral and antikickback legislation the stark law the social security act includes a provision commonly known as the stark law this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship unless an exception is met these types of referrals are known as selfreferrals sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to 15000 for each violation up to 100000 for sham arrangements up to 10000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs there are a number of exceptions to the selfreferral prohibition including an exception for a physicians ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit service or subpart however federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities this regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physicianowned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards nonetheless because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the stark law antikickback statute a provision of the social security act known as the antikickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting receiving offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using referring ordering recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program however changes to the antikickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law the antikickback statute contains certain exceptions and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors from the federal antikickback statute for various activities these activities which must meet certain requirements include but are not limited to the following investment interests space rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale of practice referral services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies investments in group practices freestanding surgery centers donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the antikickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities   5  although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the antikickback statute or other applicable laws violations of the antikickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to 25000 for each violation or imprisonment however under 18 usc section 3571 this fine may be increased to 250000 for individuals and 500000 for organizations civil money penalties may include fines of up to 50000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration andor exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid similar state laws many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the antikickback statute and the stark law some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure in many instances the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes however in most cases little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we dont have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see item 3 legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations federal false claims act and similar state regulations a current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act and in particular actions being brought by individuals on the governments behalf under the false claims acts qui tam or whistleblower provisions whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government when a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the false claims act the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 10781 to 21563 for each separate false claim there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 fera has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the false claims act eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds fera also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention as well as the receipt of overpayments in addition recent changes to the antikickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil false claims act further a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court recent changes to the false claims act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified or by the date any corresponding cost report was due whichever is later failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil false claims act liability other fraud and abuse provisions the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid false claims include but are not limited to billing for services not rendered billing for services without prescribed documentation misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud like the antikickback statute these provisions are very broad further the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs hipaa also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare there are civil penalties for prohibited conduct including but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services hipaa administrative simplification and privacy requirements the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech require the use of uniform    6  electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry hipaa also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed violations of hipaa can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties we believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of hipaa as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance the hipaa security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of patient information hitech has since strengthened certain hipaa rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information extended certain hipaa provisions to business associates and created new security breach notification requirements hitech has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a hipaa violation has occurred we believe that we have been in substantial compliance with hipaa and hitech requirements to date recent changes to the hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf red flags rule in addition the federal trade commission ftc red flags rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft the red flag program clarification act of 2010 signed on december 18 2010 appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the red flags rule but permits the ftc or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the red flags rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 on july 29 2005 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 was enacted which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety this legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report patient safety work product pswp to patient safety organizations psos under the system pswp is made privileged confidential and legally protected from disclosure pswp does not include medical discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety this legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute pswp psos are certified by the secretary of the hhs for threeyear periods and analyze pswp provide feedback to providers and may report nonidentifiable pswp to a database in addition psos are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies environmental regulations our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal state and local environmental laws rules and regulations infectious waste generators including hospitals face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste including civil penalties of up to 25000 per day of noncompliance criminal penalties of up to 50000 per day imprisonment and remedial costs in addition our operations as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws rules and regulations we believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws corporate practice of medicine several states including florida nevada california and texas have laws andor regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or feesplitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to or the recommendation of particular providers for medical products and services possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties in addition agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable these statutes andor regulations vary from state to state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies we do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and feesplitting with physicians we do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements emtala all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospitals emergency room for treatment and if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency to either stabilize the patients condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patients ability to pay for treatment there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patients ability to pay penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program in addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under emtala an injured patient the patients family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospitals violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute   7  the federal government broadly interprets emtala to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospitals emergency room but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospitals campus generally or to a hospitalbased clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospitalowned ambulance subject to certain exceptions emtala does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services however cms has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively cms has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments the government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce emtala violations actively in the future we believe that we operate in substantial compliance with emtala health care industry investigations we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings included herein for additional disclosure in addition currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices including ours although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions or that we will not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties in connection with the investigations even if we were to ultimately prevail the governments inquiry andor action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity it is also possible that our executives andor managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation andor named as defendants in private litigation revenue rulings 9815 and 200451 in march 1998 and may 2004 the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between forprofit and notforprofit hospitals as a result of the tax rulings the irs has proposed and may in the future propose to revoke the taxexempt or public charity status of certain notforprofit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the taxexempt or public charity status of a notforprofit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with notforprofit hospitals andor require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with notforprofits state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state in the aggregate state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results of operations medical malpractice tort law reform medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level all states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits over half of the states have limits on damages awards almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits and many states have established limits on attorney fees many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform proposed solutions include enacting limits on noneconomic damages malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates reform legislation has also been proposed but not adopted at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area compliance program our companywide compliance program has been in place since 1998 currently the programs elements include a code of conduct risk area specific policies and procedures employee education and training an internal system for reporting concerns auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies since its initial adoption the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs specific written policies procedures training and educational materials and programs as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program claims preparation and submission including coding billing and cost reports comprise the bulk of these areas financial arrangements with    8  physicians and other referral sources including compliance with antikickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training standardized documentation requirements and review and audit united kingdom regulation our operations in the united kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements employee regulation clinical standards environmental rules as well as other areas we are also subject to a highly regulated business environment and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business employees and medical staff   our facilities located in the us had approximately 75325 employees as of december 31 2016 of whom approximately 54800 were employed fulltime in addition our facilities located in the uk had approximately 5800 employees as of december 31 2016 our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals in a number of our markets physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours within our acute care division approximately 190 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time in addition within our behavioral health division approximately 440 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations each of our hospitals is managed on a daytoday basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours in addition a board of governors including members of the hospitals medical staff governs the medical professional and ethical practices at each hospital we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory    approximately 1000 of our employees at six of our hospitals are unionized at valley hospital medical center unionized employees belong to the culinary workers and bartenders union and the international union of operating engineers nurses technicians and engineers at desert springs hospital are represented by the service employees international union seiu and the international union of operating engineers at the george washington university

hospital in boston are represented by the seiu at brooke glen behavioral hospital unionized employees are represented by the teamsters and the northwestern nurses associationpennsylvania association of staff nurses and allied professionals  competition the health care industry is highly competitive in recent years competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to among other things regulatory and technological changes increasing use of managed care payment systems cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals in addition some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sale and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical surgical and behavioral health services facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us the number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff are important factors in determining a hospitals success and competitive advantage typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patients needs the quality of other physicians on the medical staff the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospitals facilities we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians in addition we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are    9  experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws the application process for approval of additional covered services new facilities changes in operations and capital expenditures is therefore highly competitive in these states in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities competition in the form of new services facilities and capital spending is more prevalent see regulation and other factors our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment in addition employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges in return hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients generally hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price market reputation geographic location quality and range of services quality of the medical staff and convenience the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets the competition to acquire hospitals is significant we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit health care companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms relationship with universal health

any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also impact our business and results of operations a significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in texas nevada and california texas we own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals and 24 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 16 in 2016 17 in 2015 and 18 in 2014 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 7 in 2016 11 in 2015 and 17 in 2014 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest nevada we own 7 inpatient acute care hospitals and 4 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 16 in 2016 15 in 2015 and 16 in 2014 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 13 in 2016 10 in 2015 and 11 in 2014 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest california we own 5 inpatient acute care

attributable to noncontrolling interest the significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in texas nevada and california any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors we derive a significant portion of our revenue from thirdparty payors including the medicare and medicaid programs changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and in some cases reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities we are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of among other things the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs in addition the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the united kingdom are derived from governmental payors if the    12  rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the united states or united kingdom are reduced there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 100 million annually from each of texas california washington dc nevada pennsylvania illinois virginia and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors including managed care providers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals private payors including managed care providers increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations reductions or changes in medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations on january 3 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the 2012 act the 2012 act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the budget control act of 2011 the postponed sequestration cuts include a 2 annual reduction over ten years in medicare spending to providers medicaid is exempt from sequestration in order to offset the costs of the legislation the 2012 act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost 26 billion over ten years approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in medicare reimbursement to hospitals although the bipartisan budget act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestrationrelated budgetary cuts spending reductions related to the medicare program remain in place on december 26 2013 president obama signed into law hj res 59 the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which includes the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 the act in addition on february 15 2014 public law 113082 was enacted the act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programsincluding medicarefor another three years through 2024 please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenuemedicare for additional disclosure the 2012 act includes a document and coding dci adjustment and a reduction in medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments expected to save 105 billion over 10 years the dci adjustment decreases projected medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases these reductions are meant to recoup what medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to medicare severity diagnosis related groups the reduction in medicaid dsh payments is expected to save 42 billion over 10 years this provision extends the changes regarding dsh payments established by the legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform on march 23 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 the reconciliation act which

provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses although it is expected that as a result of the legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable the legislation makes a number of other changes to medicare and medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us it has been projected that the legislation will result in a net reduction in medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals totaling 155 billion over 10 years the legislation revises reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals the legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019 a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning october 1 2011 for medicare part b reimbursable items and services and beginning october 1 2012 for medicare inpatient hospital services the legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both medicare dsh and medicaid dsh payments the medicare dsh reductions began in october 2013 while the medicaid dsh reductions are scheduled to begin in 2018 the legislation implements a valuebased purchasing program which will reward the delivery of efficient care conversely certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospitalacquired condition rates   13  a 2012 us supreme court ruling limited the federal governments ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain medicaid coverage requirements pursuant to that decision the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing medicaid funding therefore states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal medicaid funding as a result many states including texas have not expanded their medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding in addition in king vs burwell the supreme court decided in favor of the federal governments ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges a number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges the supreme courts decision in this case ultimately preserved the viability of federally facilitated exchanges a different decision by the supreme court could have resulted in an increased number of uninsured patients generally including an increase of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states  the various provisions in the legislation that directly or indirectly affect medicare and medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years the impact of the legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges certain legislation provisions such as those creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future thus we cannot predict the impact of the legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations the legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare the legislation amends several existing laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers while congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the antikickback statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law the legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the antikickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil false claims act the legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil false claims act although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending the legislation also expands the recovery audit contractor program to medicaid these amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities these investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician selfreferral law the legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physicianowned hospitals and restricts the ability of physicianowned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities as discussed below should the legislation be repealed in its entirety this aspect of the legislation would also be repealed restoring physician ownership of hospitals and expansion right to its position and practice as it existed prior to the legislation  the impact of the legislation on each of our hospitals may vary because legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years we anticipate that many of the provisions in the legislation may be subject to further revision initiatives to repeal the legislation in whole or in part to delay elements of implementation or funding and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election the ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the legislation and legal challenges to the legislation are unknown results of recent congressional elections and the change of presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the legislation are repealed or revised specifically president donald trumps 100 day action plan called for full repeal of the legislation and its replacement with health savings accounts crossstates sales of health insurance and modifications to statemanaged medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear and president donald trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the legislation should be preserved it remains unclear what portions of the legislation may remain or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals accordingly there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation or for our hospitals to receive payment for services   14  we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as well as the emergency medical treatment and active labor act or emtala we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor andor seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patients medical condition within the facilitys capability or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospitals written procedures our obligations under emtala may increase substantially going forward cms has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request if the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under emtala is proposed and adopted our results of operations will be harmed if we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors in recent years the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased cms publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the medicare program federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported additionally the legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services if any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys or results that are lower than our competitors or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing this circumstance could harm our business and results of operations an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations collection of receivables from thirdparty payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patients responsibility which primarily includes copayments and deductibles however we also have substantial receivables due to us from certain statebased funding programs we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix the agings of the receivables historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted significant changes in business office operations payor mix economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable cash flow and results of operations if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses our results of operations will be harmed our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers the healthcare industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sales and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we the number of inpatient facilities as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly as a result most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment we also operate health care facilities in the united kingdom where the national health service the nhs is the principal provider of healthcare services in the united kingdom in addition to the nhs we face competition in the united kingdom from independent sector providers and other publicly funded entities for patients  if our competitors are better able to attract patients recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed   15  our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment as a result the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline it may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the nonurban communities in which our hospitals are located our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations generally the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions the loss of one or more of these physicians even if temporary could cause a material reduction in our revenues which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected the technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and as a result manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers to compete effectively we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur if our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry patients may seek treatment from other providers andor physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business if we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ehr our operations could be harmed pursuant to hitech regulations hospitals that did not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 were subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff if our general labor and related expenses increase we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations   16  increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized it is possible our labor costs could increase materially if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal state and local government levels relating to among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services relationships with physicians and other referral sources adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services ownership of facilities qualifications of medical and support personnel confidentiality maintenance privacy and security issues associated with healthrelated information and patient medical records the screening stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions certification licensure and accreditation of our facilities operating policies and procedures and construction or expansion of facilities and services among these laws are the federal false claims act the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the federal antikickback statute and the provision of the social security act commonly known as the stark law these laws and particularly the antikickback statute and the stark law impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities including employment contracts leases and professional service agreements we also provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the antikickback statute a number of our current arrangements including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the antikickback statute failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the antikickback statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the antikickback statute cms published a medicare selfreferral disclosure protocol which is intended to allow providers to selfdisclose actual or potential violations of the stark law because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the stark law there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the stark law or that selfdisclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties federal regulations issued under hipaa contain provisions that require us to implement and in the future may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patients health and related financial information such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative physical and technical requirements on us restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf additionally recent changes to hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation in the future it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws see item 3legal proceedings or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be see item 1 businessselfreferral and antikickback legislation if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we also operate health care facilities in the united kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and as a result are subject to certain us and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally including anticorruption laws the foreign corrupt practices act regulates us companies in their dealings with foreign officials prohibiting bribes and similar practices and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate    17  internal accounting controls in addition the united kingdom bribery act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the united kingdom our operations in the united kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to o registration and licensing requirements employee regulation clinical standards environmental rules as well as other areas we are also subject to a highly regulated business environment and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business we are subject to occupational health safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations regulatory requirements affecting us include but are not limited to those covering i air and water quality control ii occupational health and safety eg standards regarding bloodborne pathogens and ergonomics etc iii waste management iv the handling of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances and v other hazardous materials if we fail to comply with those standards we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits product liability lawsuits class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters we may choose to negotiate a settlement amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations we believe that based on our past experience and actuarial estimates our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals while we continuously monitor our coverage our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance it could have a material adverse effect on our operations we may be subject to governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government and as a result the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware please see item 3 legal proceedings for disclosure of current related matters the failure of certain employers or the closure of certain facilities could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals the economies in the nonurban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care the failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them the occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations thereby harming our business if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid the construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation relating to among other things the adequacy of medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures fire prevention ratesetting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection additionally such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards all of our hospitals are deemed certified meaning that they are accredited properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program the effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with    18  applicable federal state local and other relevant regulations and standards however should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected our growth strategy depends in part on acquisitions and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from notforprofit entities due to regulatory scrutiny acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit healthcare companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do also suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms in addition many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that affect the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a healthcare facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations further the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations depending on various factors including the amount paid for the acquisition the acquired hospitals results of operations allocation of the purchase price effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel in addition acquisition activity requires transitions from and the integration of operations and usually information systems that are used by acquired hospitals in addition some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals our results of operations could be harmed   the trend toward valuebased purchasing may negatively impact our revenues    we believe that valuebased purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing in federal healthcare programs medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically in addition hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments and hospitals that have excess readmissions for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement furthermore medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospitalacquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 hospitals that rank in the worst 25 of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year were subject to reduced medicare reimbursements the aca also prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain providerpreventable conditions    there is a trend among private payers toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services as well many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events we expect valuebased purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet quality standards established by both governmental and private payers    19  if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities we could become liable for material obligations hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities including but not limited to liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire such liabilities and related legal or other costs andor resulting damage to a facilitys reputation could harm our business we are subject to pending legal actions purported stockholder class actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions we our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions see item 3legal proceedings  defending ourselves against the allegations in the lawsuits and governmental investigations or similar matters and any related publicity could potentially entail significant costs and could require significant attention from our management we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any such loss however these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate to past present and future facts events circumstances and occurrences should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity  in particular government investigations as well as qui tam lawsuits may lead to material fines penalties damages payments or other sanctions including exclusion from government healthcare programs settlements of lawsuits involving medicare and medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need or con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition expansion or replacement make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs result in the revocation of a facilitys license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us any of which could harm our business in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues controls imposed by thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as utilization review have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors including physicians clinical decisions and availability payor programs shifting to a more outpatientbased environment whether or not certain services are offered seasonal and severe weather conditions including the effects of extreme low temperatures hurricanes and tornados earthquakes current local economic and demographic changes in addition technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer   20  a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business  if a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets our business could be adversely affected such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose or that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases if any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities further a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols the potential impact of a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business  a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations our patient volumes revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance as a result our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes particularly in less intense more elective service lines or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes revenues and operating results in addition as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 38 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet should the revenues and financial results of our acute care andor behavioral health care facilities be materially unfavorably impacted due to among other things a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results legal uncertainty or a worsening of the economic conditions in the united kingdom could materially affect our business and future results of operations on june 23 2016 the united kingdom affirmatively voted in a nonbinding referendum in favor of the exit of the united kingdom from the european union the brexit and it has been approved by vote of the british legislature negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the united kingdoms relationship with the european union including the terms of trade between the united kingdom and the european union the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to european union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate the announcement of brexit also created and the actual exit of the united kingdom from the european union may create future economic uncertainty both in the united kingdom and globally the actual exit of the united kingdom from the european union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business any of these effects of brexit and the announcement thereof and others we cannot anticipate could harm our business financial condition or results of operations fluctuations in our operating results quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and as a result there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized in addition to our operating results many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein demographic changes operating results of other hospital companies changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts speculation in the press or investment community the possible effects of war terrorist and other hostilities adverse weather conditions the level of seasonal illnesses managed care contract negotiations and terminations changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the health care industry   21  our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in pounds we monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk while we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price as a publicly traded company we are subject to a significant body of regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations for example we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form 10k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions fines or other sanctions or litigation if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting our stock price could decline a cyber security incident could cause a violation of hipaa breach of member privacy or other negative impacts we rely extensively on our information technology it systems to manage clinical and financial data communicate with our patients payors vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results in addition we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 a cyberattack that bypasses our it security systems causing an it security breach loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws loss of proprietary business information or a material disruption of our it business systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations in addition our future results of operations as well as our reputation could be adversely impacted by theft destruction loss or misappropriation of public health information other confidential data or proprietary business information different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition generally accepted accounting principles are complex continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased as we continue to invest in modern technologies emergency rooms and operating room expansions the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation expansion construction and addition of medical equipment and technology we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand improve and equip our existing hospitals we cannot predict however whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed which could harm our business   22  to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate longterm debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business the expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient quality healthcare services at our facilities which could harm our business the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock is subject to potential increases or decreases at december 31 2016 218 million shares of class b common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of class a c and d common stock outstanding for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase class b common stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans class a c and d common stock are convertible on a share for share basis into class b common stock to the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of class b common stock the number of shares of class b common stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of class b common stock would own a smaller percentage of that class in addition from timetotime our board of directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our class b common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock conversely as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business we may from timetotime issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock based upon factors such as but not limited to the market price of our stock interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share the right to elect the majority of our board of directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of class a and c common stock the majority of which is owned by alan b miller our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors our restated certificate of incorporation provides that with respect to the election of directors holders of class a common stock vote as a class with the holders of class c common stock and holders of class b common stock vote as a class with holders of class d common stock with holders of all classes of our common stock entitled to one vote per share as of march 22 2016 the shares of class a and class c common stock constituted 75 of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock had the right to elect five members of the board of directors and constituted 864 of our general voting power as of that date as of march 22 2016 the shares of class b and class d common stock excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options constituted 925 of the outstanding shares of our common stock had the right to elect two members of the board of directors and constituted 136 of our general voting power as of that date as to matters other than the election of directors our restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of class a class b class c and class d common stock all vote together as a single class except as otherwise provided by law each share of class a common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote each share of class b common stock entitles the holder thereof to onetenth of a vote each share of class c common stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes provided the holder of class c common stock holds a number of shares of class a common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class c common stock that holder holds and each share of class d common stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes provided the holder of class d common stock holds a number of shares of class b common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class d common stock that holder holds   23  in the event a holder of class c or class d common stock holds a number of shares of class a or class b common stock respectively less than ten times the number of shares of class c or class d common stock that holder holds then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of class c common stock or onetenth of a vote for every share of class d common stock which that holder holds in excess of onetenth the number of shares of class a or class b common stock respectively held by that holder the board of directors in its discretion may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds ten times as many shares of class a or class b common stock as class c or class d common stock respectively if such facts are not apparent from our stock records since a substantial majority of the class a shares and class c shares are controlled by mr alan b miller and members of his family one of whom marc d miller is also a director and officer of our company and they can elect a majority of our companys directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company in addition because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses our business and prospects and the trading price of our

completed the acquisition of cambian group plcs adult services division the cambian adult services the cambian adult services division consists of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the uk the competition and markets authority cma in the uk is currently reviewing our acquisition of the cambian adult services we estimate that the cmas review of our acquisition will be completed during the second quarter of 2017 however until such review is completed we are not permitted to integrate the cambian adult services business into our existing businesses located in the uk further we can provide no assurance that the cma will not require us to divest certain parts of the cambian adults services division or certain parts of our existing business located in the uk we own or lease medical office buildings adjoining some of our hospitals we believe that the leases on the facilities medical office buildings and other real estate leased or owned by us do not impose any material limitation on our operations the aggregate lease payments on facilities leased by us were 74 million in 2016 69 million in 2015 and 66 million in 2014     item 3  legal proceedings we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations regulatory matters and litigation as outlined below office of inspector general oig and government investigations in february 2013 the office of inspector general for the united states department of health and human services oig served a subpoena requesting various documents from january 2008 to the date of the subpoena directed at universal health services inc uhs

behavioral health hartgrove hospital rock river academy and residential treatment center roxbury treatment center harbor point behavioral health center fka the pines residential treatment center including the crawford brighton and kempsville campuses wekiva springs center and river point behavioral health prior to receiving this subpoena i the keys of carolina and old vineyard received notification during the second half of 2012 from the doj of its intent to proceed with an investigation following requests for documents for the period of january 2007 to the date of the subpoenas from the north carolina state attorney generals office ii harbor point behavioral health center received a subpoena in december 2012 from the attorney general of the commonwealth of virginia requesting various documents from july 2006 to the date of the subpoena and iii the meadows psychiatric center received a subpoena from the oig in february 2013 requesting certain documents from 2008 to the date of the subpoena unrelated to these matters the keys of carolina was closed and the real property was sold in january 2013 we were advised that a qui tam action had been filed against roxbury treatment center but the government declined to intervene and the case was dismissed in april 2013 the oig served facility specific subpoenas on wekiva springs center and river point behavioral health requesting various documents from january 2005 to the date of the subpoenas in july 2013 another subpoena was issued to wekiva springs center and river point behavioral health requesting additional records in october 2013 we were advised that the dojs criminal frauds section had opened an investigation of river point behavioral health and wekiva springs center subsequent subpoenas have since been issued to river point behavioral health and wekiva springs center requesting additional documentation in april 2014 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms instituted a medicare payment suspension at river point behavioral health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations the florida agency for health care administration subsequently issued a medicaid payment suspension for the facility river point behavioral health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension notwithstanding cms continued the payment suspension river point behavioral health provided additional information to cms in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect we cannot predict if andor when the facilitys suspended payments will resume although the operating results of river point behavioral health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended december 31 2016 or 2015 the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facilitys results of operations and financial condition in june 2013 the oig served a subpoena on coastal harbor health system in savannah georgia requesting documents from january 2009 to the date of the subpoena in february 2014 we were notified that the investigation conducted by the criminal frauds section had been expanded to include the national deaf academy in march 2014 a civil investigative demand cid was served on the national deaf academy requesting documents and information from the facility from january 1 2008 through the date of the cid we have been advised by the government that the national deaf

behavioral health requesting documents and information from those facilities from january 2008 through the date of the cid in september 2014 the doj civil division advised us that they were expanding

in late march 2015 we were notified that the investigation conducted by the criminal frauds section had been expanded to include uhs as a corporate entity arising out of the coordinated investigation of the facilities described above and in particular hartgrove hospital in december 2015 we were notified by the doj civil division that the civil investigation also includes arbour hospital arbourfuller hospital pembroke hospital and westwood lodge located in massachusetts to date these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information  the doj has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a false claims act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities at present we are uncertain as to potential liability andor financial exposure of the company andor named facilities if any in connection with these matters in december 2015 we were advised that the doj opened an investigation involving the el paso behavioral health system in el paso texas the doj was investigating potential stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physicians at the facility these agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of ascend    33  health corporation in october 2012 to our knowledge this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above we have reached a settlement with the doj which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements concluding this matter  in january 2016 we were notified that the department of justice opened an investigation of the south texas health system of a potential false claim act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005 in february 2017 we were notified that the department of justice decided not to intervene in an under seal qui tam case and filed a notice of declination further we have been informed that the relator is dismissing the case litigation us ex rel escobar v universal health services inc et al this is a false claims act case filed against universal health services inc uhs of delaware inc and hri clinics inc dba arbour counseling services in us district court for the district of massachusetts this qui tam action primarily alleges that arbour counseling services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to medicaid were subsequently improper relators make other claims of improper billing to medicaid associated with alleged failures of arbour counseling to comply with state regulations the us attorneys office and the massachusetts attorney generals office initially declined to intervene uhs filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case the first circuit court of appeals first circuit reversed the trial courts dismissal of the case the united states supreme court subsequently vacated the first circuits opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the supreme court for false claims act cases during the 4th quarter of 2016 the first circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial courts dismissal the case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in january 2017 the us attorneys office and massachusetts attorney generals office advised of the potential for intervention in the case we are defending this case vigorously at this time we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter    heed v universal health services inc et al in december 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in us district court for the central district of california against uhs and certain uhs officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities although we have not been served with the complaint at this time we deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter    other matters in late september 2015 many hospitals in pennsylvania including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state received letters from the pennsylvania department of human services the department demanding repayment of allegedly excess medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments dsh for the federal fiscal year 2011 ffy2011 amounting to approximately 4 million in the aggregate in september 2016 we received similar requests for repayment for alleged dsh overpayments for ffy2012 we filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for ffys 2011 and 2012 as we believe the departments calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations the department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the states share of the dsh payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but recently started recoupment of the federal share if the department is ultimately successful in its demand related to ffy2011 and ffy2012 it could take similar action with regards to ffy2013 and ffy2014 due to a change in the pennsylvania medicaid state plan and implementation of a cmsapproved medicaid section 1115 waiver we do not believe the methodology applied by the department to ffy2011 and ffy2012 is applicable to reimbursements received for medicaid services provided after january 1 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in pennsylvania we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the departments repayment demands if our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments  matters relating to psychiatric solutions inc psi the following matters pertain to psi or former psi facilities owned by subsidiaries of psi which were in existence prior to the acquisition of psi and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in november 2010 department of justice investigation of friends hospital in october 2010 friends hospital in philadelphia pennsylvania received a subpoena from the doj requesting certain documents from the facility the requested documents were collected and provided to the doj for review and examination another subpoena was issued to the facility in july 2011 requesting additional documents which have also been delivered to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at    34  present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter department of justice investigation of riveredge hospital in 2008 riveredge hospital in chicago illinois received a subpoena from the doj requesting certain information from the facility additional requests for documents were also received from the doj in 2009 and 2010 the requested documents have been provided to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter general we operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations these claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries medical malpractice commercialcontractual disputes wrongful restriction of or interference with physicians staff privileges and employment related claims in addition health care companies are subject to investigations andor actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf government action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations currently and from time to time we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas civil investigative demands audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies these inquiries can lead to notices andor actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential noncompliance with laws and regulations further the federal false claim act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits qui tam actions against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government various states have also adopted similar statutes when such a claim is filed the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case these qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with the false claims acts requirements if the government chooses not to intervene the private individuals can proceed independently on behalf of the government health care providers that are found to violate the false claims act may be subject to substantial monetary finespenalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with corporate integrity agreements as a condition of a settlement of a false claim act matter in september 2014 the criminal division of the doj announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened the doj has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities in addition health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program conditions of participation in the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a condition of participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiencys the facility faces termination from the medicare and medicaid programs or compliance with a system improvement agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance the laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering among other things government healthcare participation requirements licensure certification and accreditation privacy of patient information reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding further the affordable care act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of medicare and medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud we monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws rules and regulations although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with government regulations there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines penalties andor substantial damages repayment obligations payment suspensions licensure revocation and expulsion from government healthcare programs even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations including the matters described above cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors including but not limited to i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate ii discovery is not complete iii the proceeding is in its early stages iv the matters present legal uncertainties v there are significant facts in dispute vi there are a large number of parties or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes it is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial position cash flows and potentially our reputation   35  in addition various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations

in item 1a risk factors forwardlooking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at or by which such performance or results will be achieved forwardlooking information is based on information available at the time andor our good faith belief with respect to future events and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements such factors include among other things the following          our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations andor changes in laws and government regulations          an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level no assurances can be given that the implementation of these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations          possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors including medicare or medicaid in the united states and government based payors in the united kingdom          our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same including contracts with unitedsierra healthcare in las vegas nevada          the outcome of known and unknown litigation government investigations false claim act allegations and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in item 3 legal proceedings          the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national regional and local economic and business conditions including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions          competition from other healthcare providers including physician owned facilities in certain markets          technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing or reduce the demand for healthcare          our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals          demographic changes          our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities          as discussed below in sources of revenue we receive revenues from various state and county based programs including medicaid in all the states in which we operate we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 100 million annually from each of texas california washington dc nevada pennsylvania illinois virginia and massachusetts cmsapproved medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including texas mississippi illinois oklahoma nevada arkansas california and indiana and state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including texas and south carolina we are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states we can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations          our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms including borrowed funds to fund the future growth of our business          our inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends          our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations          in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the patient protection and affordable care act the aca were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs the two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade    42          initiatives to repeal the aca in whole or in part to delay elements of implementation or funding and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election the ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the aca and legal challenges to the aca are unknown results of recent congressional elections and the change of presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the aca are repealed or revised specifically president donald trumps 100 day action plan called for full repeal of the aca and its replacement with health savings accounts crossstates sales of health insurance and modifications to statemanaged medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear and president donald trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the aca should be preserved it remains unclear what portions of the aca may remain or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals accordingly there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation or for our facilities to receive payment for services          the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations in july 2010 implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore were not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015 however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations          in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law the 2011 act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint committee which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year annual reduction of approximately 36 million to our medicare net revenues with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs the bipartisan budget act of 2015 enacted on november 2 2015 continued the 2 reductions to medicare reimbursement imposed under the 2011 act we cannot predict whether congress will restructure the implemented medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress going forward          uninsured and selfpay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our selfpay patient accounts          changes in our business strategies or development plans          fluctuations in the value of our common stock and          other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission given these uncertainties risks and assumptions as outlined above you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made we assume no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements to reflect actual results changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forwardlooking information except as may be required by law all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement   43  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note 1 to the financial statements we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 32 of our net patient revenues during 2016 34 during 2015 and 38 during 2014 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 56 of our net patient revenues during 2016 54 during 2015 and 52 during 2014  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2016 2015 or 2014 if it were to occur each 1 adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december 31 2016 would change our aftertax net income by approximately 1 million we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort historically a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which in part has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles generally patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective services who have gross income less than 400 of the federal    44  poverty guidelines are deemed eligible for charity care the federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size effective january 1 2016 our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable net a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from thirdparty payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patients responsible party at the time of registration at that time an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned there are various preestablished insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates subject to the ultimate disposition of the patients medicaid eligibility when the patients ultimate eligibility is determined reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as medicaid pending although the patients ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2016 2015 or 2014 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible we also provide discounts to uninsured patients included in uninsured discounts amounts below who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable in implementing the discount policy we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs charity care or any other discount program if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs the uninsured discount is applied our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 410 million and 399 million at december 31 2016 and 2015

health records incentive payments in july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and ended as late as 2016 for medicare and can end as late as 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology    45  for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we have recognized medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria  medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria selfinsuredother insurance risks we provide for selfinsured risks including general and professional liability claims workers compensation claims and healthcare and dental claims our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies all relevant information including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate our estimated selfinsured reserves are reviewed and changed if necessary at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense in addition we also i own commercial health insurers headquartered in reno nevada and puerto rico and ii maintain selfinsured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims the ultimate costs related to these programsoperations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported given our significant insurancerelated exposure there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  see note 8 to the consolidated financial statementscommitments and contingencies for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability workers compensation liability and property insurance  longlived assets we review our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated october 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of october 1 2016 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets there were also no impairments during 2015 or 2014 during 2015 we changed our annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles testing date from september 1st to october 1st management believes that this voluntary change in accounting method is preferable as it aligns the annual impairment testing date with our annual budgeting process the 2015 change in annual testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review including profitability and market value projections could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a writeoff of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances relating to state net operating loss carryforwards we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws we are subject to audits by any of these

federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size effective january 1 2016 our hospitals in certain states in which we operate reduced the charity care eligibility threshold to less than the federal poverty guidelines during 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 this change resulted in an increase in the charity care component of our total uncompensated care and a decrease in the uninsured discount component    the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately 628 million during 2016 631 million during 2015 and 590 million during 2014  the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the abovementioned total uncompensated care amounts the percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities an increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results

between september of 2014 and december of 2015 and          a 9 million net decrease resulting from the reduction to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves applicable to our behavioral health facilities recorded during 2014  sources of revenue overview we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers including managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg medicalsurgical intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons many of which are beyond our control the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis as well as increased pressure from medicare medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible on a less expensive outpatient basis we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues   56  patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare medicaid some private insurance plans and managed care plans but are responsible for services not covered by such plans exclusions deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage the amount of such exclusions deductibles and coinsurance has generally been increasing each year indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of among other things economic recovery stimulus packages responses to natural disasters and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 hr 4872 pl 111152 the reconciliation act and the patient protection and affordable care act pl 111148 the aca were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below initiatives to repeal the aca in whole or in part to delay elements of implementation or funding and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election the ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the aca and legal challenges to the aca are unknown results of recent congressional elections and the change of presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the aca are repealed or revised specifically president donald trumps 100 day action plan called for full repeal of the aca and its replacement with health savings accounts crossstates sales of health insurance and modifications to statemanaged medicaid programs nevertheless prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear and president donald trump has already indicated that popular provisions of the aca should be preserved it remains unclear what portions of the aca may remain or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals accordingly there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation or for our hospitals to receive payment for services the following tables show

medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over some disabled persons and persons with endstage renal disease all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program under the medicare program for inpatient services our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps under the ipps hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge the fixed payment amount is based upon each patients medicare severity diagnosis related group msdrg every msdrg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis the msdrg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care this msdrg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each msdrg the msdrg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services other than the msdrg payment a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold msdrg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year which begins on october 1 the index used to adjust the msdrg rates known as the hospital market basket index gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services generally however the percentage increases in the msdrg payments have been lower than the

hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 100 million annually from each of texas california washington dc nevada pennsylvania illinois virginia and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states   the aca substantially increases the federally and statefunded medicaid insurance program and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized nonmedicaid health plans for lowincome residents not eligible for medicaid starting in 2014 however the supreme court has struck down portions of the aca requiring states to expand their medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding accordingly many states in which we operate have not expanded medicaid coverage to individuals at 133 of the federal poverty level facilities in states not opting to expand medicaid coverage under the aca may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in 2018 as discussed below we can provide no assurance that further reductions to medicaid revenues particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations   various state medicaid supplemental payment programs   we incur healthcare related taxes provider taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to i healthcare items or services ii the provision of or the authority to provide the health care items or services or iii the payment for the health care items or services such provider taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state medicaid programs as outlined below we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases andor lump sum medicaid supplemental payments      60  included in these provider tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with texas

supplemental payment section 1115 waiver indigent care programs section 1115 waiver uncompensated care uc payments replace the former upper payment limit upl payments these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with thirdparty hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from thirdparty affiliated hospitals the supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an intergovernmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals however the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any igt on the amount of any private hospitals indigent care obligation  on september 30 2014 cms notified the texas health and human services commission thhsc that it was deferring the federal matching funds approximately 75 million on texas medicaid uc payments made to providers in certain counties a deferral results in cms withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers a deferral goes into effect when cms questions the basis for all or part of the amount of medicaid payments made to certain providers and remains in place subject to cmss final determination our texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral on january 7 2015 cms removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying uc financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars in may 2015 thhsc was informed by cms that current privatehospital funding arrangements can continue for waiverpayment dates through august 2017 without risk of disallowance of federal matching funds on the same grounds questioned in last years deferral   for state fiscal year 2017 texas medicaid will continue to operate under a cmsapproved section 1115 fiveyear medicaid waiver demonstration program extended by cms for fifteen months to december 31 2017 during the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal

other state medicaid supplemental payment programs will approximate 145 million net of provider taxes of 159 million during the year ended december 31 2017 this estimate is based upon various terms and conditions that are out of our control including but not limited to the statescmss continued approval of the programs and the applicable hospital district or county making igts consistent with 2016 levels future changes to these terms and conditions could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations in addition provider taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that if reduced from current rates in several states could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations texas and south carolina medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of lowincome patients ie those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25 are eligible to receive a dsh adjustment congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments although this legislation and the resulting state broadbased provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program to date the net impact has not been materially adverse  upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolinas low income patients five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each states dsh fund the south carolina and texas dsh programs were renewed for each states 2017 dsh fiscal year covering the period of october 1 2016 through september 30 2017 during the second quarter of 2015 the thhsc finalized dsh payments for federal fiscal year 2014 which resulted in a 6 million annualized reduction in our texas medicaid dsh payments retroactive to october 2013  in connection with these dsh programs included in our financial results was an aggregate of 39 million during 2016 36 million during 2015 and 49 million during 2014 we expect reimbursements to our hospitals pursuant to the 2017 fiscal year programs for texas and south carolina to be at amounts similar to each states 2016 fiscal year amounts  the aca and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2018 see below in sources of revenues and health care reformmedicaid revisions for additional disclosure the us department of health and human services is to determine the amount of medicaid dsh payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology as medicaid dsh payments to states will be cut consequently payments to medicaidparticipating providers including our hospitals in texas and south carolina will likely be reduced in the coming years we are unable to estimate the impact of this federally required reduction at this time   nevada spa     62  in nevada cms approved a state plan amendment spa in august 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to january 1 2014 and which was subsequently approved through september 30 2016 in july 2016 cms approved the program for the period of july 1 2016 through june 30 2017    in connection with this program our financial results included revenues of approximately 14 million in 2016 10 million in 2015 and 12 million in 2014 assuming the program is approved for the states 2018 fiscal year we estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate 20 million during the year ended december 31 2017    risk factors related to state supplemental medicaid payments   as outlined above we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental medicaid payment programs the states include but are not limited to texas mississippi illinois oklahoma nevada arkansas california and indiana failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary igts for the states share of the dsh programs failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs or reductions in reimbursements could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations   in april 2016 cms published its final medicaid managed care rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of passthrough payments including supplemental payments by medicaid managed care organizations mco to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the passthrough payments into valuebased payment structures delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a mco contract since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations hitech act in july 2010 the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria the governments ultimate goal is to promote more effective quality and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system pursuant to hitech act regulations hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015 however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations in connection with the implementation of ehr applications at our acute care hospitals our consolidated results of operations include net pretax charges of 28 million during 2016 18 million during 2015 and 8 million during 2014 these net pretax charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense related to the costs incurred for the purchase and development of the application net of ehr incentive income as reflected on our consolidated statements of income and the portion of the net expense that was attributable to noncontrolling interests   federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st  we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies which include health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs in general we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating    63  results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate typically we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers however during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policy holders based upon the particular hospitals established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms including predetermined payment or drgbased payment systems for more inpatient and outpatient services to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage such patients are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care writeoffs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances health care reform listed below are the medicare medicaid

will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for    64  services provided to insured patients or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward valuebased purchasing there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services these valuebased purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events the aca contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing the aca prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions hac beginning in ffy 2015 hospitals that fall into the top 25 of national riskadjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1 reduction in their total medicare payments additionally hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard the aca also required hhs to implement a valuebased purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on october 1 2012 the aca requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1 in ffy 2013 and increasing by 025 each fiscal year up to 2 in ffy 2017 and subsequent years hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions in its fiscal year 2016 ipps final rule cms will fund the valuebased purchasing program by reducing base operating drg payment amounts to participating hospitals by 175 for ffy 2017 this reduction will increase to 2 readmission reduction program in the

hrrp for federal fiscal year 2016 will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations accountable care organizations the aca requires hhs to establish a medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations acos the aco program allows providers including hospitals physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services the program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established by hhs will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the medicare program in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations postpayment audits requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years because of audits by the program representatives providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments nevertheless until final adjustments are made certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required   finally we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results   65    interest expense below is a schedule of our

rate        354          345          349       in may 2016 we purchased thirdparty minority ownership interests in six acute care hospitals located in las vegas nevada prior to that date outside owners held various noncontrolling minority ownership interests in eight of our acute care facilities and one behavioral health care facility each of these facilities are owned and operated by limited liability companies llc or limited partnerships lp as a result since there is no income tax liability incurred at the llclp level since it passes through to the memberspartners the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests does not include any income tax provisionbenefit when computing the provision for income taxes as reflected on our consolidated statements of income the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from income before income taxes since it represents the thirdparty memberspartners share of the income generated by the jointventure entities in addition to providing the effective tax rates as indicated above as calculated from dividing the provision for income taxes by the income before income taxes as reflected on the consolidated statements of income we believe it is helpful to our investors that we also provide our effective tax rate as calculated after giving effect to the portion of our pretax income that is attributable to the thirdparty memberspartners the effective tax rates as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by the difference in income before income taxes minus net income

   effective tax rate        368          367          373       the impact of discrete tax items did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes during 2016 2015 or 2014 the decrease in the effective tax rate during 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to lower effective income tax rates    67  applicable to the income generated during 2015 at the behavioral health care facilities located in the uk that were acquired since the third quarter of 2014  we consider the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 and 2015 to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 54 million and 49 million respectively effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality our acute care services business is typically seasonal with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year this seasonality occurs because generally more people become ill during the winter months which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years however since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply and other costs we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal state and local laws which have been enacted that in certain cases limit our ability to increase prices we believe however that through adherence to cost containment policies labor management and reasonable price increases the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable liquidity year ended december 31 2016 as compared to december 31 2015 net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 1289 billion during 2016 as compared to 1021 billion during 2015 the net increase of 268 million was primarily attributable to the following

risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves         item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2016 and 2015 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes   75  seven interest rate swaps on a total notional amount of 825 million matured in may 2015 four of these

swap entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 100 million and receive onemonth libor the swap became effective on december 15 2015 and is scheduled to mature on april 15 2019 the fixed rate payable on this swap is 121 we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on quotes from our counterparties we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities at december 31 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was de minimis on a net basis comprised of a 4 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a 4 million liability which in included in other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability

notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements   92  notes to consolidated financial statements     1 business and summary of significant accounting policies services provided by our hospitals all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery internal medicine obstetrics emergency room care radiology oncology diagnostic care coronary care pediatric services pharmacy services andor behavioral health services we through our subsidiaries provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities including central purchasing information services finance and control systems facilities planning physician recruitment services administrative personnel management marketing and public relations the more significant accounting policies follow a principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majorityowned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated b revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 32 of our net patient revenues during 2016 34 during 2015 and 38 during 2014 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 56 of our net patient revenues during 2016 54 during 2015 and 52 during 2014  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the united kingdom are derived from government based payors the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs and the government based payor programs in the united kingdom are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future government based reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2016 2015 and 2014 we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care c charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial    93  assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort historically a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which in part has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective services who have gross income less than 400 of the federal poverty guidelines are deemed eligible for charity care the federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable net a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from thirdparty payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patients responsible party at the time of registration at that time an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned there are various preestablished insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates subject to the ultimate disposition of the patients medicaid eligibility when the patients ultimate eligibility is determined reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as medicaid pending although the patients ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2016 2015 or 2014 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible we also provide discounts to uninsured patients included in uninsured discounts amounts below who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable in implementing the discount policy we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs charity care or any other discount program if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs the uninsured discount is applied  on a consolidated basis we monitor our total selfpay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 410 million and 399 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively uncompensated care charity care and uninsured discounts the following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care

 the provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals was approximately 628 million during 2016 631 million during 2015 and 590 million during 2014    94  the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the abovementioned total uncompensated care amounts the percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities an increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results             amounts in thousands             2016        2015        2014

illinois of approximately 38 million and 28 million respectively collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures approximately 25 million as of december 31 2016 and 12 million as of december 31 2015 of the receivables due from illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days as of each respective date although the accounts receivable due from illinois could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due to us from illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows d concentration of revenues our six acute care hospitals in the las vegas nevada market contributed on a combined basis 14 in 2016 13 in 2015 and 14 in 2014 of our consolidated net revenues   e accounting for medicare and medicaid electronic health records incentive payments in july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and ended as late as 2016 for medicare and can end as late as 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we have recognized medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria  medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria f cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents g property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost expenditures for renewals and improvements are charged to the property accounts replacements maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred we remove the cost and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts for assets sold or retired and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations constructioninprogress includes both construction projects and equipment not yet placed into service   95  while in progress we capitalized interest on major construction projects and the development and implementation of information technology applications amounting to 19 million during 2016 and 304000 during 2015 there was no interest capitalized during 2014  depreciation is provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements twenty to forty years and equipment three to fifteen years depreciation expense was 3508 million during 2016 3375 million during 2015 and 3145 million during 2014  h longlived assets we review our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates i goodwill goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated october 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed impairment assessments as of october 1 2016 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets there were also no impairments during 2015 or 2014 future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment reviews including profitability and market value projections could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a writeoff of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended december 31 2016 were as follows in thousands             acute care services        behavioral health services        total

professional liability claims and workers compensation claims our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies all relevant information including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate our estimated selfinsured reserves are reviewed and changed if necessary at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense see note 8  commitments and contingencies for discussion of adjustments to our prior year reserves for claims related to our selfinsured general and professional liability and workers compensation liability in addition we also i own commercial health insurers headquartered in nevada and puerto rico and ii maintain selfinsured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims the ultimate costs related to these programsoperations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred

investments and hedging activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts we manage our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within stockholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item in the income statement for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future   we use forward exchange contracts to

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues

to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state medicaid programs we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases andor lump sum medicaid supplemental payments  under these programs including the impact of the texas uncompensated care and upper payment limit program the texas delivery system reform incentive program and various other state programs we earned revenues before provider taxes of approximately 327 million during 2016 307 million during 2015 and 295 million during 2014 these revenues were offset by provider taxes of approximately 166 million during 2016 137 million during 2015 140 million during 2014 which are recorded in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income as included herein the aggregate net benefit from these programs was 161 million during 2016 170 million during 2015 and 155 million during 2014 the aggregate net benefit pursuant to these programs is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular states portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements in addition under various disproportionate share hospital payment programs and the nevada state plan amendment program we earned revenues of 53 million in 2016 46 million in 2015 and 61 million in 2014   y recent accounting standards in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which eliminates the guidance in topic 740 income taxes that required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets between current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet the amendments require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group as well as any related valuation allowance be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet the amendments are effective for public business entities for annual fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 we early adopted this standard effective january 1 2016 on a prospective basis and did not adjust prior periods presented the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated statements of income or consolidated statement of cash flows   in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which adds or clarifies guidance of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows with the intent to alleviate diversity in practice for classifying various types of cash flows this asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our statement of cash flows in april and august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 and asu no 201515 interest imputation of interest respectively to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs the standard requires debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability the fasb clarified that debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements can be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the arrangement the guidance is effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2015 we adopted this standard on january 1 2016 on a retrospective basis and adjusted prior periods presented in connection with the adoption of this asu debt issuance costs of 26 million as of december 31 2016 and 19 million as of december 31 2015 were recorded as deductions from the carrying value of our longterm debt liabilities the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations   in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which amends the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions to require recognition of the tax effects resulting from the settlement of stockbased awards as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur in addition the asu requires that all taxrelated cash flows resulting from sharebased payments including the excess tax benefits related to the settlement of stockbased awards be classified as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows the asu also requires that cash paid by directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows in addition the asu also allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest consistent with current us gaap or account for forfeitures when they occur we have adopted this new standard which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 as of january 1 2017 since the impact of asu 201609 on our future    100  consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows is dependent upon the timing of stock option exercises and the market price of our stock at the time of exercise we are unable to estimate the impact this adoption will have on our future financial statements in may 2014 and march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201409 and asu 201608 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 and revenue from contracts with customers principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net respectively which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires additional disclosures the fasb updated the new revenue standard by clarifying the principal versus agent implementation guidance but does not change the core principle of the new standard asu 201409 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 however in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of this standard with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 we anticipate the most significant change will be how the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts will be recognized under the new standards under the current standards our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based upon our historical experience have been included within net revenue under the new standards our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience will continue to be recognized as a reduction to net revenue however subsequent changes in estimate of collectability due to a change in the financial status of a payor for example a bankruptcy will be recognized as bad debt expense in operating charges we will continue to evaluate the impact that the adoption of this asu may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 amendments to the fasb accounting standards codification update 201602 which requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key qualitative and quantitative information about the entitys leasing arrangements this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted a modified retrospective approach is required upon adoption of this new standard we will recognize significant right of use assets and lease obligation liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of our operating lease obligations operating lease expense will still be recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining life of the lease within lease and rental expense in the consolidated statements of income we are currently evaluating the effect that asu 201602 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   in january 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201704 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment asu 201704 which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill asu 201704 is effective for us for the annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted and applied prospectively we do not expect asu 201704 to have a material impact on our financial statements    in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 business combinations topic 805  clarifying the definition of a business to clarify the definition of a business in order to allow for the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses asu 201701 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the future impact of asu 201701 will be dependent upon the nature of future acquisitions or dispositions made by us if any    from time to time new accounting guidance is issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies that is adopted by the company as of the effective date or in some cases where early adoption is permitted in advance of the effective date the company has assessed the

material to our 2014 net income attributable to uhs and net income attributable to uhs per diluted share assuming the acquisitions occurred on january 1 2014 our 2014 unaudited pro forma net revenues

businesses during 2014 we received 15 million in connection with the divestiture of a nonoperating investment during the first quarter and the real property of a closed behavioral health facility during the second quarter     3 financial instruments fair value hedges during 2016 2015 and 2014 we had no fair value hedges outstanding cash flow hedges we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated    104  other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2016 and 2015 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes seven interest rate swaps on a total notional amount of 825 million matured in may 2015 four of these swaps with a total notional amount of 600 million became effective in december 2011 and provided that we receive threemonth libor while the average fixed rate payable was 238 the remaining three swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million

on december 15 2015 all of these swaps are scheduled to mature on april 15 2019 the average fixed rate payable on these four swaps is 123 and one interest rate swap entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 100 million and receive onemonth libor the swap became effective on december 15 2015 and is scheduled to mature on april 15 2019 the fixed rate payable on this swap is 121 we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based on quotes from our counterparties we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities at december 31 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was de minimis on a net basis comprised of a 4 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a 4 million liability which is included in other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability of 1 million comprised of a 5 million asset which is included in other assets offset by a 6 million liability which is included in other current liabilities   foreign currency forward exchange contracts we use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income and remains there until either the sale or liquidation of the subsidiary the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded net favorable cash inflows of 79 million 23 million and 16

is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on available evidence it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized therefore valuation allowances of approximately 52 million and 51 million have been reflected as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively during 2016 the valuation allowance on these state

no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of foundations we adopted the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective january 1 2007 during 2016 and 2015 the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were increased less than 1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years during 2016 the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of less than 1 million the balance at each of december 31 2016 and 2015 if subsequently recognized that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately 1 million as of each date  we recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we have accrued interest and penalties of less than 1 million as of each date the us federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2013 and subsequent years foreign and us state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years the statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve    113  months it is reasonably possible that

provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence selfinsured retention either 3 million or 10 million or underlying policy limits up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate

acquisition of the cambian group plcs adult services division have been included in the abovementioned uk insurance program  our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations as of december 31 2016 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 207 million of which 48 million is included

professional liability amount is net of adjustment recorded during 2014 as discussed below our consolidated results of operations during 2016 and 2015 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for professional and general liability claims during 2014 based upon a reserve analysis of our estimated future claims payments we recorded a reduction to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to 20 million    115  as of december 31 2016 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 67 million of which 33 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2015 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 68 million of which 34 million is included in current liabilities our consolidated results of operations during 2016 2015 or 2014 were not materially impacted by adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims  although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for selfinsured general and professional and workers compensation claims given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves property insurance we have commercial property insurance policies for our properties covering catastrophic losses including windstorm damage up to a 1 billion policy limit per occurrence subject to a deductible ranging from 50000 to 250000 per occurrence losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3 and 5 of the

national flood insurance program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible property insurance for our behavioral health facilities located in the uk are provided on an all risk basis up to a 129 billion limit that includes coverage for real and personal property as well as business interruption losses legal proceedings we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of

regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations the florida agency for health care administration subsequently issued a medicaid payment suspension for the facility river point behavioral health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension notwithstanding cms continued the payment suspension river point behavioral health provided additional information to cms in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect we cannot predict if andor when the facilitys suspended payments will resume although the operating results of river point behavioral health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended december 31 2016 or 2015 the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facilitys results of operations and financial condition   116  in june 2013 the oig served a subpoena on

massachusetts to date these facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information  the doj has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a false claims act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities at present we are uncertain as to potential liability andor financial exposure of the company andor named facilities if any in connection with these matters in december 2015 we were advised that the doj opened an investigation involving the el paso behavioral health system in el paso texas the doj was investigating potential stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physicians at the facility these agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october 2012 to our knowledge this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above we have reached a settlement with the doj which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements concluding this matter  in january 2016 we were notified that the department of justice opened an investigation of the south texas health system of a potential false claim act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005 in february 2017 we were notified that the department of justice decided not to intervene in an under seal qui tam case and filed a notice of declination further we have been informed that the relator is dismissing the case litigation us ex rel escobar v universal health services inc et al this is a false claims act case filed against universal health services inc uhs of delaware inc and hri clinics inc dba arbour counseling services in us district court for the district of massachusetts this qui tam action primarily alleges that arbour counseling services failed to appropriately supervise certain clinical providers in contravention of regulatory requirements and the submission of claims to medicaid were subsequently improper relators make other claims of improper billing to medicaid associated with alleged failures of arbour counseling to comply with state regulations the us attorneys office and the massachusetts attorney generals office initially declined to intervene uhs filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court originally granted the motion dismissing the case the first circuit court of appeals first circuit reversed the trial courts dismissal of the case the united states supreme court subsequently vacated the first circuits opinion and remanded the case for further consideration under the new legal standards established by the supreme court for false claims act cases during the 4th quarter of 2016 the first circuit issued a revised opinion upholding their reversal of the trial courts dismissal the case was then remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in january 2017 the us attorneys office and massachusetts attorney generals office advised of the potential for intervention in the case we are defending this case vigorously at this time we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter      117  heed v universal health services inc et al in december 2016 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in us district court for the central district of california against uhs and certain uhs officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws plaintiff alleges that defendants violated federal securities laws relating to the disclosures made in public filings associated with practices at our behavioral health facilities although we have not been served with the complaint at this time we deny liability and intend to defend ourselves vigorously at this time we are uncertain as to potential liability or financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter    other matters in late september 2015 many hospitals in pennsylvania including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state received letters from the pennsylvania department of human services the department demanding repayment of allegedly excess medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments dsh for the federal fiscal year 2011 ffy2011 amounting to approximately 4 million in the aggregate in september 2016 we received similar requests for repayment for alleged dsh overpayments for ffy2012 we filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts for ffys 2011 and 2012 as we believe the departments calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations the department has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the states share of the dsh payments until all hospital appeals are resolved but recently started recoupment of the federal share if the department is ultimately successful in its demand related to ffy2011 and ffy2012 it could take similar action with regards to ffy2013 and ffy2014 due to a change in the pennsylvania medicaid state plan and implementation of a cmsapproved medicaid section 1115 waiver we do not believe the methodology applied by the department to ffy2011 and ffy2012 is applicable to reimbursements received for medicaid services provided after january 1 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in pennsylvania we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to the departments repayment demands if our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments  matters relating to psychiatric solutions inc psi the following matters pertain to psi or former psi facilities owned by subsidiaries of psi which were in existence prior to the acquisition of psi and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in november 2010

the requested documents were collected and provided to the doj for review and examination another subpoena was issued to the facility in july 2011 requesting additional documents which have also been delivered to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter department of justice investigation of riveredge hospital in 2008 riveredge hospital in chicago illinois received a subpoena from the doj requesting certain information from the facility additional requests for documents were also received from the doj in 2009 and 2010 the requested documents have been provided to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter general we operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations these claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries medical malpractice commercialcontractual disputes wrongful restriction of or interference with physicians staff privileges and employment related claims in addition health care companies are subject to investigations andor actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf government action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations currently and from time to time we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas civil investigative demands audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies these inquiries can lead to notices andor actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential noncompliance with laws and regulations further the federal false claim act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits qui tam actions against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government various states have also adopted similar statutes when such a claim is filed the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case these qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with    118  the false claims acts requirements if the government chooses not to intervene the private individuals can proceed independently on behalf of the government health care providers that are found to violate the false claims act may be subject to substantial monetary finespenalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with corporate integrity agreements as a condition of a settlement of a false claim act matter in september 2014 the criminal division of the doj announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened the doj has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities in addition health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program conditions of participation in the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a condition of participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiencys the facility faces termination from the medicare and medicaid programs or compliance with a system improvement agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance the laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering among other things government healthcare participation requirements licensure certification and accreditation privacy of patient information reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding further the affordable care act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of medicare and medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud we monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws rules and regulations although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with government regulations there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines penalties andor substantial damages repayment obligations payment suspensions licensure revocation and expulsion from government healthcare programs even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations including the matters described above cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors including but not limited to i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate ii discovery is not complete iii the proceeding is in its early stages iv the matters present legal uncertainties v there are significant facts in dispute vi there are a large number of parties or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes it is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial position cash flows and potentially our reputation in addition various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations in addition to our longterm debt obligations as discussed in note 4  longterm debt and our operating lease obligations as discussed in note 7  lease commitments we have various other contractual commitments outstanding as of december 31 2016 as follows i other combined estimated future purchase obligations of 350 million
