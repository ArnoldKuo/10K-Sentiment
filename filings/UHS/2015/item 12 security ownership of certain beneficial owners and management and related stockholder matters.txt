cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements such factors include among other things the following           our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations andor changes in laws and government regulations    42    table of contents        an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level no assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations           possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government based payors including medicare or medicaid in the united states and government based payors in the united kingdom           an increase in the number of uninsured and selfpay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our selfpay patient accounts           our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same including contracts with unitedsierra healthcare in las vegas nevada           the outcome of known and unknown litigation government investigations false claim act allegations and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters as disclosed in item 3 legal proceedings           the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national regional and local economic and business conditions including a worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions           competition from other healthcare providers including physician owned facilities in certain markets           technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing or reduce the demand for healthcare           our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals           demographic changes           our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities           as discussed below in sources of revenue we receive revenues from various state and county based programs including medicaid in all the states in which we operate we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas washington dc pennsylvania california illinois nevada virginia and florida cmsapproved medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including texas oklahoma illinois mississippi arkansas and california and state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including texas and south carolina we are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states we can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations           our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms including borrowed funds to fund the future growth of our business           some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends           our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations            in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the patient protection and affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs the two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses medicare medicaid and other    43    table of contents       health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade we cannot predict the effect if any these enactments will have on our future results of operations           the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations in july 2010 implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015 however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations there will likely be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr applications which may cause material periodtoperiod changes in our future results of operations           in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law the 2011 act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint committee which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 35 million annual reduction to our medicare net revenues effective as of april 1 2013 with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs we cannot predict whether congress will restructure the implemented medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress            our accounts receivable as of december 31 2014 and 2013 include amounts due from illinois of approximately 44 million and 49 million respectively collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures approximately 23 million as of december 31 2014 and 28 million as of december 31 2013 of the receivables due from illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days as of each respective date in addition our accounts receivable as of december 31 2014 and 2013 includes approximately 102 million and 62 million due from texas in connection with medicaid supplemental payment programs the 102 million due from texas as of december 31 2014 consists of 45 million related to uncompensated care program revenues 33 million related to disproportionate share hospital program revenues and 24 million related to delivery service reform incentive payment program dsrip revenues approximately 24 million of cash was received in january 2015 from texas related to the abovementioned dsrip receivables outstanding as of december 31 2014 although the accounts receivable due from illinois and texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois andor texas failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows in september 2014    44    table of contents       cms deferred the federal matching funds on texas medicaid uncompensated care payments made to providers in certain counties in texas although our hospitals located in texas were not impacted by this deferral since they are not located in the impacted geographical areas we can provide no assurance that our hospitals will not be impacted by future deferrals if cms expands the deferrals to other counties in texas in january 2015 cms removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying uncompensated care financing arrangements to ensure compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching funds           there have been several attempts in congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca we cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the ppaca will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the ppaca as currently implemented will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations in addition a case currently pending before the supreme court of the united states king vs burwell challenges the federal governments ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges a number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges the supreme court of the united states decision in this case could result in an increased number of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states which would have an adverse impact on our future results of operations           the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms           changes in our business strategies or development plans           fluctuations in the value of our common stock and           other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission  given these uncertainties risks and assumptions as outlined above you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made we assume no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements to reflect actual results changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forwardlooking information except as may be required by law all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement  critical accounting policies and estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note 1 to the financial statements we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements including the following  revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 36 of our net patient revenues during 2014 38 during 2013 and 39 during 2012 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 50 of our net patient revenues during 2014 and 49 during each of 2013 and 2012  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and    45    table of contents  regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record  we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2014 2013 and 2012 if it were to occur each 1 adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december 31 2014 would change our aftertax net income by approximately 1 million  we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care  charity care uninsured discounts and provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort  historically a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which in part has resulted from patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective services who have gross income less than 400 of the federal poverty guidelines are deemed eligible for charity care the federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable net  a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from thirdparty payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers    46    table of contents  such as county indigent programs in certain states our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patients responsible party at the time of registration at that time an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned there are various preestablished insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates subject to the ultimate disposition of the patients medicaid eligibility when the patients ultimate eligibility is determined reclassifications may occur which impacts the reported amounts in future periods for the provision for doubtful accounts and other accounts such as medicaid pending although the patients ultimate eligibility determination may result in amounts being reclassified among these accounts from period to period these reclassifications did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2014 2013 or 2012 since our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible  we also provide discounts to uninsured patients included in uninsured discounts amounts below who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts they are not reported in our net revenues or in our net accounts receivable in implementing the discount policy we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs charity care or any other discount program if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs the uninsured discount is applied effective january 1 2014 in response to market conditions and other considerations we modified our uninsured discount policy and increased the discount to 60 of gross charges from 30 previously since we expect to collect only a small portion of amounts due from our uninsured patients the increase in the uninsured discount in 2014 had no material impact on our net revenues net income attributable to uhs or net accounts receivable as compared to prior year periods however this change resulted in an increase in uninsured discounts and a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 325 million and 395 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively  approximately 84 during 2014 and 90 during 2013 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts was

july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available  medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid ehr incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods medicaid ehr incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities as deferred ehr incentive income in our consolidated balance sheet  selfinsuredother insurance risks we provide for selfinsured risks primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies all relevant information including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate our estimated selfinsured reserves are reviewed and changed if necessary at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense in addition we also i own a commercial health insurer headquartered in reno nevada and ii maintain selfinsured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims the ultimate costs related to these programsoperations include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported given our significant insurancerelated exposure there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  professional and general liability and workers compensation liability  effective november 2010 excluding certain subsidiaries acquired since 2010 as discussed below the vast majority of our subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million and 3 million per occurrence respectively our subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence selfinsured retention either 3 million or 10 million up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred in 2014 and up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims incurred from 2011    48    table of contents  through 2013 we remain liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  since our acquisition of psychiatric solutions inc psi in november 2010 the former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 3 million per occurrence the nine behavioral health facilities acquired from ascend health corporation ascend in october 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to 12 million of aggregate coverage subject to a 100000 per occurrence deductible the 17 facilities acquired from cygnet health care limited cygnet consisting of 15 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and 2 nursing homes have policies through a commercial insurance carrier located in the united kingdom that provides for 10 million of professional liability coverage and 25 million of general liability coverage the facilities acquired from psi ascend and cygnet like our other facilities are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations as mentioned above  our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  as of december 31 2014 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 193 million of which 51 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 206 million of which 44 million is included in current liabilities  we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to 20 million during 2014 81 million during 2013 and 27 million during 2012 the favorable changes recorded during 2014 and 2012 resulted from changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis the favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013 relating to years prior to 2013 were due primarily to i an increased weighting given to companyspecific metrics to 100 from 75 and decreased general industry metrics to 0 from 25 related to projected incidents per exposure historical claims experience and loss development factors ii historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate and iii a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the companywide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years as the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased thereby providing for a statistically significant data group and taking into consideration our longhistory of companyspecific risk management programs and claims experience our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends  as of december 31 2014 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 67 million of which 32 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 64 million of which 34 million is included in current liabilities during the last three years adjustments recorded to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 or 2012  although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for selfinsured general and professional and workers compensation claims given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves    49    table of contents below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and

longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated september 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september 1 2014 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets there were also no impairments during 2013 or 2012 future changes in the    50    table of contents  estimates used to conduct the impairment review including profitability and market value

corporation in october 2012  sources of revenue  overview we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers including managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients  hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg medicalsurgical intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons many of which are beyond our control the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis as well as increased pressure from medicare medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible on a less expensive outpatient basis we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues  patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare medicaid some private insurance plans and managed care plans but are responsible for services not covered by such plans exclusions deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage the amount of such exclusions deductibles and coinsurance has generally been increasing each year indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts  the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested

medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over some disabled persons and persons with endstage renal disease all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program  under the medicare program for inpatient services our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps under the ipps hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge the fixed payment amount is based upon each patients medicare severity diagnosis related group msdrg every msdrg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis the msdrg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care this msdrg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each msdrg the msdrg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services other than the msdrg payment a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold  msdrg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year which begins on october 1 the index used to adjust the msdrg rates known as the hospital market basket index gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services generally however the percentage increases in the msdrg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  in august 2014 cms published its ipps 2015 payment rule which provides for a 29 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are

table of contents  overall increase in ipps payments would approximate 06 including the estimated decreases to our dsh payments 19 and medicare outlier threshold 06 we estimate our overall decrease from the ipps 2015 rule covering the period of october 1 2014 through september 30 2015 will approximate 19 or approximately 13 million annually this projected impact from the ipps 2015 rule includes both the impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the dsh payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service however it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below  in august 2013 cms published its final ipps 2014 payment rule which provides for a 25 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2014 rule covering the period of october 1 2013 through september 30 2014

disproportionate share hospital payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service however it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below the final rule also expands cmss policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard specifically it would require medicares external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights the two midnight rule correspondingly under the final rule cms presumes that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under medicare part b unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physicians order and an expectation that the medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights or is receiving services which cms designates as inpatient only our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the two midnight rule and although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations excluding the potential impact of the two midnight rule we do not expect the final ipps 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations in february 2014 cms extended by an additional six months a policy under which recovery auditor contractors and other medicare review contractors will not conduct postpayment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after october 1 2013 through september 30 2014 due to the continued delay in awarding contracts to new recovery audit contractors beginning in august 2014 cms initiated modifications to the current recovery auditor contractor agreements to allow the restart of some reviews  in august 2012 cms published its final ipps 2013 payment rule which provided for a 26 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule covering the period of october 1 2012 through september 30 2013 approximated 18 the impact from the ipps 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph however it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below  in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint committee which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 35 million annual reduction to our medicare net revenues effective as of april 1 2013 with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs    66    table of contents on january 2 2013 atra was enacted which among other things includes a requirement for cms to recoup 11 billion from hospitals from medicare ipps rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017 the recoupment relates to ipps documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by cms both the 2014 and 2015 ipps final rules include a 08 recoupment adjustment cms expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017 in order to recover the entire 11 billion this adjustment is reflected in the 2014 and 2015 ipps estimated impact amounts noted above  on january 1 2005 cms implemented a new psychiatric prospective payment system psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program this system replaced the costbased reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospitals base payment if it maintains a fullservice emergency department in august 2012 cms published its final psych pps rate notice for the federal fiscal year beginning october 1 2012 that final notice contained a psych pps market basket update of 27 which was reduced by 07 to reflect a productivity adjustment and reduced by 01 to reflect an other adjustment required by the social security act for rate years 2010 through 2019 in july 2013 cms released its final psych pps rate notice for the federal fiscal year 2014 the final notice contains a psych pps market basket update of 26 which is reduced by 05 to reflect a productivity adjustment and reduced by 01 to reflect an other adjustment required by the social security act  on july 31 2014 cms published it psych pps final rule for the federal fiscal year 2015 under this final rule payments to psychiatric hospitals and units are estimated to increase by 21 compared to federal fiscal year 2014 this amount includes the effect of the 29 market basket update adjusted by the affordable care act required 03 reduction and the 05 productivity adjustment the final rule also updates the inpatient psychiatric quality reporting program which requires psychiatric facilities to report on quality measures or incur a reduction in their annual payment update  in october 2014 cms published its medicare outpatient prospective payment system opps final rule for 2015 the proposed hospital market basket increase is 29 the medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 05 and 02 reduction to the 2015 opps market basket resulting in a 2015 opps market basket update at 22 in the final rule cms will reduce the 2015 medicare rates for both hospitalbased and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs when other statutorily required adjustments hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered we estimate that our overall medicare opps for 2015 will aggregate to a net increase of 02 excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2015 is estimated to be 15  in december 2013 cms published its annual final opps rule for 2014 the final hospital market basket increase is 25 the medicare statute requires a productivity adjustment reduction of 05 and 03 reduction to the 2014 opps market basket reducing the final 2014 opps market basket update to 17 in the final rule cms reduced the 2014 medicare rates for both hospitalbased and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs when other statutorily required adjustments hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered we estimate that our overall medicare opps for 2014 will aggregate to a net increase of 14 excluding the behavioral health partial hospitalization rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2014 is estimated to be 25  in november 2012 cms published its annual final medicare opps rule for 2013 the market basket increase to the opps base rate is 26 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 01 in federal fiscal year 2013 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 07 in the final rule cms implemented a significant increase in the 2013 medicare rates for both hospitalbased and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs when other statutorily required adjustments hospital    67    table of contents  patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered our overall medicare opps payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 35 excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2013 was approximately 17  medicaid medicaid is a joint federalstate funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care most state medicaid payments are made under a ppslike system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities  we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas washington dc pennsylvania california illinois nevada virginia and florida making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states based upon the state budgets for those states for the 2015 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2014 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates were relatively unchanged from the 2014 fiscal year rates  the affordable care act substantially increases the federally and statefunded medicaid insurance program and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized nonmedicaid health plans for lowincome residents not eligible for medicaid starting in 2014 however the supreme court has struck down portions of the affordable care act requiring states to expand their medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding accordingly there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand medicaid coverage to individuals at 133 of the federal poverty level facilities in states not opting to expand medicaid coverage under the affordable care act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments as discussed below we can provide no assurance that further reductions to medicaid revenues particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  texas uncompensated careupper payment limit payments  certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas hidalgo maverick potter and webb participate in medicaid supplemental payment section 1115 waiver indigent care programs section 1115 waiver uncompensated care uc payments replace the former upper payment limit upl payments these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with thirdparty hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from thirdparty affiliated hospitals the supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an intergovernmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals however the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any igt on the amount of any private hospitals indigent care obligation we recorded net revenuesbenefit from upl and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of 68 million during 2014 61 million during 2013 and 25 million during 2012 net of provider taxes of 17 million in 2014 10 million in 2013 and 0 in 2012 if the applicable hospital district or county makes igts consistent with 2014 levels and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the february 2015 thhsc proposed rule which is discussed below we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenuesbenefit earned pursuant to these programs of approximately 58 million during 2015 net of provider taxes of 11 million on february 6 2015 thhsc published a proposed rule that would shift 136 million in funding from the private hospital uc pool to the large public hospital uc pool for the 2014 uc program year only thhsc has not provided an estimated impact from this proposed shift due to the fact that certain uc data elements are not yet available as such we are unable to estimate the impact of this proposed rule change    68    table of contents on september 30 2014 cms notified the texas health and human services commission that it was deferring the federal matching funds approximately 75 million on texas medicaid uc payments made to providers in certain counties a deferral results in cms withholding funds from the state representing the federal portion of medicaid payments the state has previously made to providers a deferral goes into effect when cms questions the basis for all or part of the amount of medicaid payments made to certain providers and remains in place subject to cmss final determination our texas hospitals are not located in the geographic areas impacted by this deferral on january 7 2015 cms removed the aforementioned deferral but indicated they will continue their review and assessment of the underlying uc financing arrangements as to ensure their compliance with the applicable federal regulations and eligibility for federal matching dollars  for state fiscal year 2015 texas medicaid will continue to operate under a cmsapproved section 1115 fiveyear medicaid waiver demonstration program during the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012 the texas health and human services commission thhsc transitioned away from upl payments to new waiver incentive payment programs uc payments and delivery system reform incentive payments dsrip during the first year of transition which commenced on october 1 2011 thhsc made payments to medicaid upl recipient providers that received payments during the states prior fiscal year during demonstration years two through five october 1 2012 through september 30 2016 thhsc has and will continue to make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals supplemental payments are also subject to an aggregate statewide caps based on cms approved medicaid waiver amounts  texas delivery system reform incentive payments  in addition the texas medicaid section 1115 waiver includes a dsrip pool to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform their service delivery practices to improve quality health status patient experience coordination and costeffectiveness dsrip pool payments are incentive payments to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care increase the quality of care the costeffectiveness of care provided and the health of the patients and families served in may 2014 cms formally approved specific dsrip projects for certain of our hospitals for demonstration years 3 to 5 our facilities did not materially participate in the dsrip pool during demonstration years 1 or 2 dsrip payments are contingent on the hospital meeting certain predetermined milestones metrics and clinical outcomes additionally dsrip payments are contingent on a governmental entity providing an igt for the nonfederal share component of the dsrip payment thhsc generally approves dsrip reported metrics milestones and clinical outcomes on a semiannual basis in june and december in connection with the dsrip program and thhscs approval for specific programs at certain of our hospitals and availability of a governmental igt we recorded approximately 17 million of net revenuesbenefit during 2014 applicable to the period of october 1 2013 through september 30 2014 net of provider taxes of 8 million although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately qualify for additional dsrip revenues subject to cmss approval and other conditions as outlined above we estimate that we may be entitled to additional dsrip net revenuesbenefit of approximately 25 million during 2015 net of provider taxes of 15 million  texas and south carolina medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments  hospitals that have an unusually large number of lowincome patients ie those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25 are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments although this legislation and the resulting state broadbased provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program to date the net impact has not been materially adverse  upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolinas low income patients five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each states dsh fund the south carolina and texas dsh programs were renewed for each states 2014 dsh fiscal year covering the period of october 1 2013 through september 30    69    table of contents  2014 in september 2013 the thhsc published its 2013 final dsh rule that included changes that resulted in approximately 9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities located in texas applicable to the states 2013 fiscal year which were included in our 2013 pretax consolidated financial results in connection with these dsh programs included in our financial results was an aggregate of 49 million during 2014 54 million during 2013 and 47 million during 2012 assuming that the texas and south carolina programs are renewed for each states 2015 and 2016 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately 49 million during 2015  the affordable care act provides for a significant reduction in medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2016 see below in sources of revenues and health care reformmedicaid revisions for additional disclosure the us department of health and human services is to determine the amount of medicaid dsh payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology as medicaid dsh payments to states will be cut consequently payments to medicaidparticipating providers including our hospitals in texas and south carolina will likely be reduced in the coming years based on the september 2013 cms final rule our medicaid dsh payments in texas and south carolina could be reduced by approximately 4 in the 2016 federal fiscal year this statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to ffy 2017 by subsequent federal legislation  in may 2013 the state of texas enacted legislation that would increase the states contribution of the nonfederal dsh share for the 2013 dsh year to 138 million as compared to the 100 million previously expected similarly the states approved 20142015 general appropriations bill rider 86 passed in may 2013 authorized 160 million for 2014 and 140 million for 2015 respectively for the nonfederal dsh share furthermore in june 2014 thhsc proposed certain changes to dsh reimbursement methodology as a result of rider 86 we expect the 2015 dsh year amounts to be comparable to the 2014 dsh year amounts  various other state medicaid supplemental payment programs  we incur healthcare related taxes provider taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to i healthcare items or services ii the provision of or the authority to provide the health care items of services or iii the payment for the health care items or services such provider taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state medicaid programs we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases andor lump sum medicaid supplemental payments including the impact of the programs in various states applicable to each year and excluding the impact of various programs in texas as discussed above and the nevada spa as discussed below we earned an aggregate net revenuesbenefit from medicaid supplemental payments of approximately 71 million during 2014 69 million during 2013 and 58 million during 2012 of which 12 million related to 2011 net of provider taxes of 112 million in 2014 74 million in 2013 and 93 million in 2012 we estimate that our aggregate net revenuesbenefit from provider tax programs will approximate 70 million during 2015 net of provider taxes of 111 million these amounts include the impact of the cms approved california provider tax and related medicaid supplemental payment programs which did not have a material impact on our operating results the aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular states portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements however provider taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that if reduced from current rates in several states could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations  in nevada cms approved a state plan amendment spa in august 2014 that implemented a hospital supplemental payment program retroactive to january 1 2014 and effective to june 30 2015 included in our 2014 results of operations was approximately 10 million of net revenues earned in connection with this program we estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate 7 million during 2015    70    table of contents as outlined above we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental medicaid payment programs failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary igts for the states share of the dsh programs failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs or reductions in reimbursements could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  hitech act in july 2010 the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria the governments ultimate goal is to promote more effective quality and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system  pursuant to hitech act regulations hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015 however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations  our 2014 consolidated results of operations includes an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately 8 million consisting of approximately 28 million of ehr incentive income less approximately 37 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pretax impact of approximately 19 million consisting of approximately 61 million of ehr incentive income less approximately 10 million of salaries wages benefits and other operating expenses approximately 33 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pretax impact of approximately 3 million consisting of approximately 30 million of ehr incentive income less approximately 15 million of salaries wages benefits and other operating expenses approximately 13 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests  federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st  we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies which include health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs in general we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow the consequent growth in    71    table of contents  managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate typically we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers however during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies  commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policy holders based upon the particular hospitals established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor  commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms including predetermined payment or drgbased payment systems for more inpatient and outpatient services to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals  other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage such patients are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care writeoffs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances  sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of among other things the war on terrorism economic recovery stimulus packages responses to natural disasters the expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations  in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 hr 4872 pl 111152 the reconciliation act and the patient protection and affordable care act pl 111148 the affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below  implemented medicare reductions and reforms           the

increase competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges the affordable care act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status gender or other specified factors we cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward  valuebased purchasing  there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services these valuebased purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events  the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing the affordable care act prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions hac beginning in ffy 2015 hospitals that fall into the top 25 of national riskadjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1 reduction in their total medicare payments hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard  the affordable care act also required hhs to implement a valuebased purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on october 1 2012 the affordable care act requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1 in ffy 2013 and increasing by    73    table of contents  025 each fiscal year up to 2 in ffy 2017 and subsequent years hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions in its fiscal year 2015 ipps final rule cms will fund the valuebased purchasing program by reducing base operating drg payment amounts to participating hospitals by 15  readmission reduction program  in the affordable care act congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program hrrp the hrrp assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates effective for discharges

pulmonary disease copd and two patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty tha and total knee arthroplasty tka in the fiscal year 2015 ipps final rule cms added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017 we do not believe impact of hrrp for federal fiscal year 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  accountable care organizations  the affordable care act requires hhs to establish a medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations acos the aco program allows providers including hospitals physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services the program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established by hhs will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the medicare program  in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations postpayment audits requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years because of audits by the program representatives providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments nevertheless until final adjustments are made certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required  finally we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations  other operating results  combined net revenues and incomelosses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals

 effects of inflation and seasonality  seasonalityour acute care services business is typically seasonal with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year this seasonality occurs because generally more people become ill during the winter months which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months  inflationinflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years however since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary    78    table of contents  pressures as are supply and other costs we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal state and local laws which have been enacted that in certain cases limit our ability to increase prices we believe however that through adherence to cost containment policies labor management and reasonable price increases the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable  liquidity  year ended december 31 2014 as compared to december 31 2013  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash

selfinsured employee benefit plans  as of december 31 2014 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 193 million of which 51 million is included in other current liabilities and 142 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities we exclude the 193 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments please see selfinsuredother insurance risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves  in connection with five acute care facilities and one additional facility currently under construction located in las vegas nevada the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance

occurrence of i certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds ii breach of the management contract by the managing member a subsidiary of ours or iii if the minority members ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds in connection with a behavioral health care facility located in philadelphia pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the psi acquisition the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time if exercised the    87    table of contents  put option requires us to purchase the minority members interest at fair market value we exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to i whether or not the put rights if exercisable will actually be exercised ii the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised and iii the timing of such payments  additionally the table above does not include 2 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2014 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized      item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction  derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement  for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future  the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2014 and 2013 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance however at december 31 2014 each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  during 2011 we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 450 million from december 2011 to december 2012 reducing to 400 million from december 2012 to december 2013 whereby we paid a premium of 740000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 700 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 700 during the term of the cap the threemonth libor never reached 700 during the term of the cap which expired in december 2013 and therefore no payment was made to us    88    table of contents we also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 425 million and receive threemonth libor three of these swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million became effective in march 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 191 the three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of 75 million 25 million and 100 million became effective in december 2011 and had corresponding fixed rates of 132 196 and 250 the 75 million 25 million and 100 million interest rate swaps matured in december 2012 december 2013 and december 2014 respectively  during 2010 we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 600 million and receive threemonth libor each of the four swaps became effective in december 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 238  during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of 150 million and received threemonth libor each of the two interest rate swaps which are now expired had an initial notional principal amount of 75 million the fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 487 and it matured in october 2011 the fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap on which the notional principal amount reduced to 50 million in october 2010 was 476 and it matured in october 2012  we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 6 million at december 31 2014 all of which is included in other current liabilities at december 31 2013 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 24 million of which 19 million was included in other current
