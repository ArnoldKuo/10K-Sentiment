sarbanesoxley act of 2002  our mission  our mission and objective is to provide superior healthcare services that patients recommend to families and friends physicians prefer for their patients purchasers select for their clients employees are proud of and investors seek for longterm results to achieve this we have a commitment to            service excellence            continuous improvement in measurable ways    1    table of contents         employee development            ethical and fair treatment            teamwork            compassion            innovation in service delivery  business strategy  we believe communitybased hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of selfdetermination for both the company and our hospitals  acquisition of additional hospitals we selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities we are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities we also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy  improvement of operations of existing hospitals and services we also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services improvement of existing services physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls  we are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities from time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need or cons although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts  quality and efficiency of services pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible we are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services in addition in response to cost containment pressures we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures in addition we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients physicians employees communities and our stockholders  in addition our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities  2013 acquisition and divestiture activity  acquisitions of assets and businesses  during 2013 we spent 13 million for the purchase of real property located in pennsylvania nevada and arizona    2    table of contents divestitures  during 2013 we received 37 million in connection with the divestiture of peak behavioral health services and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities we agreed to sell peak behavioral health services as part of our agreement with the federal trade commission in connection with our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october of 2012 the aggregate pretax gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013  hospital utilization  we believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility generally we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services level of technology emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions market penetration of managed care programs the degree of outpatient use the availability of reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice medical technology and pharmacology current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors we are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate in addition hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year  the following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated accordingly information related to hospitals acquired

respective divestiture date    2 average available beds is the number of beds which are actually in service at any given time for immediate patient use with the necessary equipment and staff available for patient care a hospital may have appropriate licenses for more beds than are in service for a number of reasons including lack of demand incomplete construction and anticipation of future needs    3 patient days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient    4 occupancy rate is calculated by dividing average patient days total patient days

including managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssources of revenue for additional disclosure other information related to our revenues income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements segment reporting   regulation and other factors  overview the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation requirements various licensure and accreditations reimbursement for patient services health information privacy and security rules and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse provisions including but not limited to federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources false claims submitted to federal health care programs    4    table of contents  and selfreferrals by physicians providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to significant fines or penalties andor required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions or that we would not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties if so subjected even if we were to ultimately prevail a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us  licensing certification and accreditation all of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care equipment and cleanliness our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal state and local health agencies as well as the requirements of municipal building codes health codes and local fire departments various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment  all of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the joint commission all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare and medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities  if any of our facilities were to lose its joint commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and medicaid programs the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs and other payors we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal state local and independent review body regulations and standards the requirements for licensure certification and accreditation are subject to change and in order to remain qualified it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel and services in the future which could have a material adverse impact on operations  certificates of need many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition expansion or replacement the imposition of civil or in some cases criminal sanctions the inability to receive medicare or medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facilitys license which could harm our business in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations  conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a health care facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of notforprofit hospitals  utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services the law and regulations require peer review organizations pros to review the appropriateness of medicare and    5    table of contents  medicaid patient admissions and discharges the quality of care provided the validity of diagnosis related group drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay pros may deny payment for services provided assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the pro be excluded from participating in the medicare program we have contracted with pros in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews  audits most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of medicare and medicaid program submitted claims if these audits identify overpayments we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights the federal government contracts with thirdparty recovery audit contractors racs and medicaid integrity contractors mics on a contingent fee basis to audit the propriety of payments to medicare and medicaid providers the recovery audit prepayment review demonstration program will enable racs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all medicare payment rules currently the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud and errorprone providers similarly medicare zone program integrity contractors zpics target claims for potential fraud and abuse additionally medicare administrative contractors macs must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms recently announced its intent to consolidate many of these medicare and medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors upics though it remains unclear what effect if any this proposed consolidation may have we have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations however potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves and any excess could potentially be substantial further medicare and medicaid regulations also provide for withholding medicare and medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances which could adversely affect our cash flow  selfreferral and antikickback legislation  the stark law the social security act includes a provision commonly known as the stark law this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship unless an exception is met these types of referrals are known as selfreferrals sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to 15000 for each violation up to 100000 for sham arrangements up to 10000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs there are a number of exceptions to the selfreferral prohibition including an exception for a physicians ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit service or subpart however federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities this recent regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physicianowned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements  we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards nonetheless because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the stark law  antikickback statute a provision of the social security act known as the antikickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting receiving offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using referring ordering recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state    6    table of contents  health care program however recent changes to the antikickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law  the antikickback statute contains certain exceptions and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors from the federal antikickback statute for various activities these activities which must meet certain requirements include but are not limited to the following investment interests space rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale of practice referral services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies investments in group practices freestanding surgery centers donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the antikickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities  although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the antikickback statute or other applicable laws violations of the antikickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to 25000 for each violation or imprisonment however under 18 usc section 3571 this fine may be increased to 250000 for individuals and 500000 for organizations civil money penalties may include fines of up to 50000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration andor exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid  similar state laws many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the antikickback statute and the stark law some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure in many instances the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes however in most cases little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws  these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we dont have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be  if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  federal false claims act and similar state regulations a current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act and in particular actions being brought by individuals on the governments behalf under the false claims acts qui tam or whistleblower provisions    7    table of contents  whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government  when a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the false claims act the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 to 11000 for each separate false claim there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 fera has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the false claims act eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds fera also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention as well as the receipt of overpayments in addition recent changes to the antikickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil false claims act further a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court recent changes to the false claims act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified or by the date any corresponding cost report was due whichever is later failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil false claims act liability  other fraud and abuse provisions the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid false claims include but are not limited to billing for services not rendered billing for services without prescribed documentation misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud like the antikickback statute these provisions are very broad  further the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs hipaa also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare there are civil penalties for prohibited conduct including but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services  hipaa administrative simplification and privacy requirements the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry hipaa also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed violations of hipaa can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties  we believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of hipaa as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance the hipaa security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of patient information hitech has since strengthened certain hipaa rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information extended certain hipaa provisions to business associates and created new security breach notification requirements hitech has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a hipaa violation has occurred we believe that we have been in substantial compliance with hipaa and hitech requirements to date recent changes to the hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf    8    table of contents red flags rule in addition the federal trade commission ftc red flags rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft the red flag program clarification act of 2010 signed on december 18 2010 appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the red flags rule but permits the ftc or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the red flags rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future  patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 on july 29 2005 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 was enacted which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety this legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report patient safety work product pswp to patient safety organizations psos under the system pswp is made privileged confidential and legally protected from disclosure pswp does not include medical discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety this legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute pswp psos are certified by the secretary of the hhs for threeyear periods and analyze pswp provide feedback to providers and may report nonidentifiable pswp to a database in addition psos are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies  environmental regulations our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal state and local environmental laws rules and regulations infectious waste generators including hospitals face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste including civil penalties of up to 25000 per day of noncompliance criminal penalties of up to 50000 per day imprisonment and remedial costs in addition our operations as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws rules and regulations we believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws  corporate practice of medicine several states including florida nevada california and texas have laws andor regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or feesplitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to or the recommendation of particular providers for medical products and services possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties in addition agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable these statutes andor regulations vary from state to state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies we do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and feesplitting with physicians we do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements  emtala all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospitals emergency room for treatment and if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency to either stabilize the patients condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patients ability to pay for treatment there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patients ability to pay penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program in addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under emtala an injured patient the patients family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospitals violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute    9    table of contents the federal government broadly interprets emtala to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospitals emergency room but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospitals campus generally or to a hospitalbased clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospitalowned ambulance subject to certain exceptions emtala does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services however cms has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively cms has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments the government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce emtala violations actively in the future we believe that we operate in substantial compliance with emtala  health care industry investigations we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings included herein for additional disclosure in addition currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services  we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices including ours although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions or that we will not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties in connection with the investigations even if we were to ultimately prevail the governments inquiry andor action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results  our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity it is also possible that our executives andor managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation andor named as defendants in private litigation  revenue rulings 9815 and 200451 in march 1998 and may 2004 the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between forprofit and notforprofit hospitals as a result of the tax rulings the irs has proposed and may in the future propose to revoke the taxexempt or public charity status of certain notforprofit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the taxexempt or public charity status of a notforprofit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with notforprofit hospitals andor require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with notforprofits  state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state in the aggregate state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results of operations  medical malpractice tort law reform medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level all states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits over half of the states have limits on    10    table of contents  damages awards almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits and many states have established limits on attorney fees many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform proposed solutions include enacting limits on noneconomic damages malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates reform legislation has also been proposed but not adopted at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area  compliance program our companywide compliance program has been in place since 1998 currently the programs elements include a code of conduct risk area specific policies and procedures employee education and training an internal system for reporting concerns auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies  since its initial adoption the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs specific written policies procedures training and educational materials and programs as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program claims preparation and submission including coding billing and cost reports comprise the bulk of these areas financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources including compliance with antikickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training standardized documentation requirements and review and audit  medical staff and employees  our facilities had approximately 66100 employees on december 31 2013 of whom approximately 47000 were employed fulltime our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals in a number of our markets physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours within our acute care division approximately 140 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time in addition within our behavioral health division approximately 380 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations each of our hospitals is managed on a daytoday basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours in addition a board of governors including members of the hospitals medical staff governs the medical professional and ethical practices at each hospital we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  approximately 1600 of our employees at five of our hospitals are unionized at valley hospital medical center unionized employees belong to the culinary workers and bartenders union the international union of operating engineers and the service employees international union seiu nurses and technicians at desert springs hospital are represented by the seiu and international union of operating engineers at the george washington university

and an appeal the results have not yet been certified the national labor relations board is currently reviewing the appeal    11    table of contents competition  the health care industry is highly competitive in recent years competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to among other things regulatory and technological changes increasing use of managed care payment systems cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals in addition some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sale and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us  in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical surgical and behavioral health services facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us  the number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff are important factors in determining a hospitals success and competitive advantage typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patients needs the quality of other physicians on the medical staff the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospitals facilities we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians  in addition we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues  many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws the application process for approval of additional covered services new facilities changes in operations and capital expenditures is therefore highly competitive in these states in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities competition in the form of new services facilities and capital spending is more prevalent see regulation and other factors  our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment in addition employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges in return hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients generally hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price market reputation geographic location quality and range of services quality of the medical staff and convenience the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations    12    table of contents a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets the competition to acquire hospitals is significant we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit health care companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms  relationship with universal health realty income trust  at december 31 2013 we held approximately 61 of the outstanding shares of universal health realty income trust the trust we serve as advisor to the trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the trusts daytoday affairs provide administrative services and present investment opportunities in addition certain of our officers and directors are also officers andor directors of the trust management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the trust therefore we account for our investment in the trust using the equity method of accounting we earned an advisory fee from the trust which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income of approximately 24 million during 2013 21 million during 2012 and 20 million during 2011  our pretax share of income from the trust was 842000 during 2013 12 million during 2012 and 46 million during 2011 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year included in our share of the trusts income for 2012 and 2011 was approximately 500000 in 2012 and 37 million in 2011 related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the trust in connection with i gains on the sale of medical office buildings in 2012 and 2011 and ii gain on fair value recognition resulting from the trusts purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies partially offset by a provision for asset impairment in 2011  the carrying value of our investment in the trust was 81 million and 93 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the market value of our investment in the trust was 315 million at december 31 2013 and 399 million at december 31 2012 based on the closing price of the trusts stock on the respective dates  total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the trust as discussed below was 164 million during 2013 and 163 million during each of 2012 and 2011 in addition certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the trust holds either 100 of the ownership interest or various noncontrolling majority ownership interests  the trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries most of the leases were entered into at the time the trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5year renewal terms each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental as discussed below the base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year the leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are crossdefaulted with one another  pursuant to the terms of the leases with the trust we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term in addition we have rights of first refusal to i purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price terms and conditions of any thirdparty offer or ii renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of and for 180 days after the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any thirdparty offer we also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at

subject to numerous known and unknown risks many of which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also impact our business and results of operations  a significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in nevada texas and california  nevada we own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties we owned two additional behavioral health facilities which were acquired by us from psi in november 2010 before the facilities were divested during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the federal trade commission as discussed herein on a combined basis these facilities contributed 16 during each of 2013 and 2012 and 17 in 2011 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 6 in 2013 8 in 2012 and 11 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  texas we own 7 acute care hospitals and 22 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 18 of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2013 2012 and 2011 on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 15 in 2013 12 in 2012 and 14 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  california we own 5 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 9 in 2013 and 10 of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2012 and 2011 on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 4 in 2013 6 in 2012 and 5 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  the significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in nevada texas and california any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results  our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from thirdparty payors including the medicare and medicaid programs changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and in some cases reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities we are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of among other things the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs if the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations  we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc illinois virginia and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in    15    table of contents  medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1 or approximately 15 million annually from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012 based upon the state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates will remain relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates  in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors including managed care providers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals private payors including managed care providers increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment  we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations  a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations  our patient volumes revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets a continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued high unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance as a result our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes particularly in less intense more elective service lines or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes revenues and operating results  our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions particularly in certain markets such as nevada texas and california where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high in our acute care business we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities we can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue during 2013 our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile making it difficult to predict the results for 2014 or thereafter  in addition we recorded approximately 237 billion of aggregate goodwill as a result of our acquisition of psi in november 2010 and ascend in october 2012 and as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 305 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet should the revenues and financial results of our acute care andor behavioral health care facilities be materially unfavorably impacted due to among other things a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  reductions or changes in medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  on january 3 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the 2012 act the 2012 act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the budget control act of    16    table of contents  2011 the postponed sequestration cuts include a 2 annual reduction over ten years in medicare spending to providers medicaid is exempt from sequestration the 2012 act provides a oneyear fix to statutory reductions in physician reimbursement and extends other medicare provisions in order to offset the cost of these extensions the 2012 act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost 26 billion over ten years approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in medicare reimbursement to hospitals although the bipartisan budget act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestrationrelated budgetary cuts spending reductions related to the medicare program remain in place on december 26 2013 president obama signed into law hj res 59 the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which includes the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 the act in addition on february 15 2014 public law 113082 was enacted the act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs  including medicare  for another three years through 2024 please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenuemedicare for additional disclosure  the 2012 act includes a document and coding dci adjustment and a reduction in medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments expected to save 105 billion over 10 years the dci adjustment decreases projected medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases these reductions are meant to recoup what medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to medicare severity diagnosis related groups the reduction in medicaid dsh payments is expected to save 42 billion over 10 years this provision extends the changes regarding dsh payments established by the legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level  we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform  on march 23 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 the reconciliation act which contains a number of amendments to the ppaca was signed into law on march 30 2010 two primary goals of the ppaca combined with the reconciliation act collectively referred to as the legislation are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses  although it is expected that as a result of the legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable the legislation makes a number of other changes to medicare and medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us it has been projected that the legislation will result in a net reduction in medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals totaling 155 billion over 10 years the legislation revises reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals the legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019 a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning october 1 2011 for medicare part b reimbursable items and services and beginning october 1 2012 for medicare inpatient hospital services the legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both medicare dsh and medicaid dsh payments the medicare dsh reductions began in october 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while medicaid dsh reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016 the legislation implements a valuebased purchasing program which will reward the delivery of efficient care conversely certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospitalacquired condition rates  a 2012 us supreme court ruling limited the federal governments ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain medicaid coverage requirements pursuant to that decision the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing medicaid funding therefore states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of    17    table of contents  federal medicaid funding as a result many states including texas have not expanded their medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding  the various provisions in the legislation that directly or indirectly affect medicare and medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years the impact of the legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations interpretive guidance and possible future legislation certain legislation provisions such as those creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future thus we cannot predict the impact of the legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  the legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare the legislation amends several existing laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers while congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the antikickback statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law the legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the antikickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil false claims act the legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil false claims act although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending the legislation also expands the recovery audit contractor program to medicaid these amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations  we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities these investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician selfreferral law the legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physicianowned hospitals and restricts the ability of physicianowned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities  the impact of the legislation on each of our hospitals may vary because legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years we anticipate that many of the provisions in the legislation may be subject to further revision we cannot predict the impact the legislation may have on our business results of operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the legislation  we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay  in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as well as the emergency medical treatment and active labor act or emtala we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor andor seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patients medical condition within the facilitys capability or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospitals written procedures our obligations under emtala may increase substantially going forward cms has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request if the number of indigent and charity care    18    table of contents  patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under emtala is proposed and adopted our results of operations will be harmed  if we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors  in recent years the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased cms publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the medicare program federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported additionally the legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services if any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys or results that are lower than our competitors or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing this circumstance could harm our business and results of operations  an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations  collection of receivables from thirdparty payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patients responsibility which primarily includes copayments and deductibles however we also have substantial receivables due to us as of december 31 2013 a significant portion of which is past due from certain statebased funding programs most particularly illinois and texas as discussed herein we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix the agings of the receivables historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted significant changes in business office operations payor mix economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable cash flow and results of operations if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses our results of operations will be harmed  our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers  the healthcare industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sales and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us  in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we the number of inpatient facilities as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly as a result most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment  if our competitors are better able to attract patients recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed    19    table of contents our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians  typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment as a result the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline  it may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the nonurban communities in which our hospitals are located our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  generally the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions the loss of one or more of these physicians even if temporary could cause a material reduction in our revenues which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians  if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected  the technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and as a result manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers to compete effectively we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur if our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry patients may seek treatment from other providers andor physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business  if we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems our operations could be harmed  as required by hitech we are in the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology if our facilities or physicians are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing an electronic health record system further beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be subject to reduced payments from medicare any failure by us to effectively implement an electronic health record system in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations  we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel    20    table of contents the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues  we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff if our general labor and related expenses increase we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations  increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized it is possible our labor costs could increase materially  if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability  the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal state and local government levels relating to among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services relationships with physicians and other referral sources adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services ownership of facilities qualifications of medical and support personnel confidentiality maintenance privacy and security issues associated with healthrelated information and patient medical records the screening stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions certification licensure and accreditation of our facilities operating policies and procedures and construction or expansion of facilities and services  among these laws are the federal false claims act the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the federal antikickback statute and the provision of the social security act commonly known as the stark law these laws and particularly the antikickback statute and the stark law impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities including employment contracts leases and professional service agreements we also provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the antikickback statute a number of our current arrangements including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the antikickback statute failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the antikickback statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the antikickback statute cms recently published a medicare selfreferral disclosure protocol which is intended to allow providers to selfdisclose actual or potential violations of the stark law because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the stark law there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the stark law or that selfdisclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties  federal regulations issued under hipaa contain provisions that require us to implement and in the future may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patients health and related financial information such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative physical and technical    21    table of contents  requirements on us restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf additionally recent changes to hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf  these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation in the future it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws see item 3legal proceedings or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be see item 1 businessselfreferral and antikickback legislation  if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  we are subject to occupational health safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations  we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations regulatory requirements affecting us include but are not limited to those covering i air and water quality control ii occupational health and safety eg standards regarding bloodborne pathogens and ergonomics etc iii waste management iv the handling of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances and v other hazardous materials if we fail to comply with those standards we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations  we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities  we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits product liability lawsuits class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters we may choose to negotiate a settlement amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations we believe that based on our past experience and actuarial estimates our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals while we continuously monitor our coverage our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  we may be subject to governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits  the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government    22    table of contents  alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government and as a result the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware please see item 3 legal proceedings for disclosure of current related matters  the failure of certain employers or the closure of certain facilities could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals  the economies in the nonurban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care the failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them the occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations thereby harming our business  if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid  the construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation relating to among other things the adequacy of medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures fire prevention ratesetting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection additionally such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards  all of our hospitals are deemed certified meaning that they are accredited properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program the effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal state local and other relevant regulations and standards however should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected  our growth strategy depends in part on acquisitions and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from notforprofit entities due to regulatory scrutiny  acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit healthcare companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do also suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms  in addition many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that affect the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a healthcare facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations    23    table of contents further the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations depending on various factors including the amount paid for the acquisition the acquired hospitals results of operations allocation of the purchase price effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases  we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy  we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel in addition acquisition activity requires transitions from and the integration of operations and usually information systems that are used by acquired hospitals in addition some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals our results of operations could be harmed  if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities we could become liable for material obligations  hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities including but not limited to liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire such liabilities and related legal or other costs andor resulting damage to a facilitys reputation could harm our business  our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions  our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions see item 3legal proceedings  state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand  many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need or con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition expansion or replacement make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs result in the revocation of a facilitys license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us any of which could harm our business  in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations  controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues  controls imposed by thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as utilization review have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient    24    table of contents  utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations  our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control  our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors including physicians clinical decisions and availability payor programs shifting to a more outpatientbased environment whether or not certain services are offered seasonal and severe weather conditions including the effects of extreme low temperatures hurricanes and tornados earthquakes current local economic and demographic changes in addition technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer  fluctuations in our operating results quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock  the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and as a result there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized  in addition to our operating results many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein demographic changes operating results of other hospital companies changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts speculation in the press or investment community the possible effects of war terrorist and other hostilities adverse weather conditions the level of seasonal illnesses managed care contract negotiations and terminations changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the health care industry  we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price  as a publicly traded company we are subject to a significant body of regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations for example we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form 10k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions fines or other sanctions or litigation if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting our stock price could decline    25    table of

causing an it security breach loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws loss of proprietary business information or a material disruption of our it business systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations in addition our future results of operations as well as our reputation could be adversely impacted by theft destruction

effect on our results of operations or financial condition  generally accepted accounting principles are complex continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects  the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased as we continue to invest in modern technologies emergency rooms and operating room expansions the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained  the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed  we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation expansion construction and addition of medical equipment and technology we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand improve and equip our existing hospitals we cannot predict however whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed which could harm our business  to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate longterm debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition  in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact

to our consolidated financial position or results of operations  general  the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include among other things matters such as government healthcare participation requirements various licensure certifications and accreditations reimbursement for patient services and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse government action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes andor regulations by healthcare providers currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving

for certain health care entities which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with

table of contents  respect to future events and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements such factors include among other things the following            our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations andor changes in laws and government regulations            an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level no assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations            possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs including medicare or medicaid            an increase in the number of uninsured and selfpay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our selfpay patient accounts            our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same including contracts with unitedsierra healthcare in las vegas nevada            the outcome of known and unknown litigation government investigations false claim act allegations and liabilities and other claims asserted against us including matters as disclosed in item 3 legal proceedings            the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national regional and local economic and business conditions including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions            competition from other healthcare providers including physician owned facilities in certain markets including mcallenedinburg texas the site of one of our largest acute care facilities and riverside county california            technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing or reduce the demand for healthcare            our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals            demographic changes            our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities            as discussed below in sources of revenue we receive revenues from various state and county based programs including medicaid in all the states in which we operate we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc illinois virginia and massachusetts cmsapproved medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including oklahoma california and arkansas and state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including texas and south carolina we are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states we can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations            our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms including borrowed funds to fund the future growth of our business            some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends    43    table of contents         our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations            in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 and the patient protection and affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs the two combined primary goals of these acts are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade we cannot predict the effect if any these enactments will have on our future results of operations            the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations in july 2010 implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year certain of our acute care hospitals implemented ehr applications in 2011 and 2012 and we continued the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals on a facilitybyfacility basis until completion which occurred in june 2013 our acute care hospitals are eligible for medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to their adoption or implementation of certified ehr technology with the exception of the newly constructed temecula valley hospital which was opened in october 2013 we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1 year one meaningful use criteria although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by 2015 there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act should we our acute care hospitals qualify for incentive payments there may be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr applications which may cause material periodtoperiod changes in our future results of operations            in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law the 2011 act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint committee which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 35 million annual reduction to our medicare net revenues effective as of april 1 2013 with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs we cannot predict whether congress will restructure the implemented medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress            our accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 includes amounts due from illinois of approximately 49 million 70 million and 54 million respectively collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures approximately 28 million as of december 31 2013 51 million as of december 31 2012 and 41 million as of december 31 2011 of the receivables due from illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days as of    44    table of contents       each respective date in addition our accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 includes approximately 46 million due from texas in connection with medicaid supplemental payment programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2014 although the accounts receivable due from illinois and texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us we have received 27 million of cash remittances from illinois in january 2014 no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois andor texas failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of

plans            fluctuations in the value of our common stock and            other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission  given these uncertainties risks and assumptions as outlined above you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made we assume no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements to reflect actual results changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forwardlooking information except as may be required by law all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement  critical accounting policies and estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note 1 to the financial statements we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements including the following  revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 38 of our net patient revenues during 2013 39 during 2012 and 41 during 2011 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 49 of our net patient revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 47 during 2011  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record  we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded    45    table of contents  estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013 2012 or 2011 if it were to occur each 1 adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december 31 2013 would change our aftertax net income by approximately 1 million  we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care and uninsured discounts in acute care hospital services for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care  a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from thirdparty payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patients responsible party at the time of registration at that time an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned there are various preestablished insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patients medicaid eligibility based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts our acute care facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications are considered when the overall individual facility and companywide reserves are developed adjustments related to the final determination of these accounts did not materially impact our results of operations in 2013 2012 or 2011  provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort  uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30 of total charges our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for    46    table of contents  doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay  on a consolidated basis we monitor our total selfpay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 395 million and 311 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively  approximately 90 during 2013 and 87 during 2012 of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts was incurred by our acute care hospitals shown below is our payer mix

          accounting for medicare and medicaid electronic health records incentive payments in july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available  medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year    47    table of contents medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid ehr incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods medicaid ehr incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities as deferred ehr incentive income in our consolidated balance sheet  selfinsured risks we provide for selfinsured risks primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies all relevant information including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate our estimated selfinsured reserves are reviewed and changed if necessary at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  professional and general liability and workers compensation liability  effective january 1 2008 most of our subsidiaries became selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per occurrence prior to our acquisition of psychiatric solutions inc psi in november 2010 our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of 10 million up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate however we are liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  prior to our acquisition in november 2010 the psi subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a 3 million selfinsured retention to a limit of 75 million psi utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of psi to manage the selfinsured retention for all former psi subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to january 1 2011 the captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims regardless of date incurred for the former psi subsidiaries located in florida and puerto rico  since our acquisition of psi on november 15 2010 the former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries which are not former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per occurrence effective november 2010 our subsidiaries including the former psi subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence selfinsured retention either 3 million or 10 million up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate we remain liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate the 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from ascend health corporation in october 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to 20 million of aggregate coverage subject to a 25000 per occurrence deductible these facilities like our other facilities are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate    48    table of contents our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 206 million of which 44 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 279 million of which 48 million is included in current liabilities  we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to 81 million during 2013 27 million during 2012 and 11 million during 2011 the favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013 relating to years prior to 2013 were due primarily to i an increased weighting given to companyspecific metrics to 100 from 75 and decreased general industry metrics to 0 from 25 related to projected incidents per exposure historical claims experience and loss development factors ii historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate and iii a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the companywide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years as the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased thereby providing for a statistically significant data group and taking into consideration our longhistory of companyspecific risk management programs and claims experience our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends the favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis the favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of thirdparty recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with phicorelated claims which we became liable for upon phicos a former commercial insurance carrier liquidation in 2002  as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 64 million of which 34 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 66 million of which 35 million is included in current liabilities the adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011  although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for selfinsured general and professional and workers compensation claims given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves    49    table of contents below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and professional liability and workers compensation reserves during the

catastrophic losses including windstorm damage up to a 1 billion policy limit per occurrence subject to a 250000 deductible for the majority of our properties the properties acquired from psychiatric solutions inc are subject to a 50000 deductible losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3 and 5 of the declared total insurable value of the property in addition we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is 250 million subject to a deductible of 250000 except for facilities located within documented fault zones earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the united states are subject to a 100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1 to 5 of the declared total insurable value of the property the earthquake limit in puerto rico is 25 million subject to a 25000 deductible noncritical flood losses have either a 250000 or 500000 deductible based upon the location of the facility since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone we have elected to purchase policies from the national flood insurance program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible  due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years our catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations    50    table of contents longlived assets we review our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated september 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september 1 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets there were also no impairments during 2012 or 2011 future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review including profitability and market value projections could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a writeoff of a portion or all of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the

acquired from ascend health corporation in october 2012            a 13 million of revenues recorded during 2012 representing the 2011 portion of the net medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to the oklahoma supplemental hospital offset payment program as well as similar programs in ohio and indiana and            42 million of other combined decreases resulting primarily from the divestiture of san juan capestrano in january 2012 pursuant to our agreement with the federal trade commission in connection with our acquisition of psi  income before income taxes increased 109 million or 15 to 839 million or 242 of net revenues during 2012 as compared to 729 million or 220 of net revenues during 2011 the increase in income before income taxes at our behavioral health facilities was attributable to            a 76 million increase at our behavioral health facilities on a same facility basis as discussed above            a 13 million increase resulting from the revenues recorded during 2012 representing the 2011 portion of the net medicaid supplemental reimbursements earned pursuant to the oklahoma supplemental hospital offset payment program as well as

health corporation in october 2012    63    table of contents sources of revenue  overview we receive payments for services rendered from private insurers including managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients  hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg medicalsurgical intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons many of which are beyond our control the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis as well as increased pressure from medicare medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible on a less expensive outpatient basis we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues  patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare medicaid some private insurance plans and managed care plans but are responsible for services not covered by such plans exclusions deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage the amount of such exclusions deductibles and coinsurance has generally been increasing each year indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and selfpay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided  the significant portion of our revenues derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in texas and nevada any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business

medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over some disabled persons and persons with endstage renal disease all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program  under the medicare program for inpatient services our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps under the ipps hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge the fixed payment amount is based upon each patients medicare severity diagnosis related group msdrg every msdrg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis the msdrg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care this msdrg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each msdrg the msdrg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services other than the msdrg payment a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold  msdrg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year which begins on october 1 the index used to adjust the msdrg rates known as the hospital market basket index gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services generally however the percentage increases in the msdrg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  in august 2013 cms published its final ipps 2014 payment rule which provides for a 25 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are

this projected impact from the ipps 2014 final rule includes both the impact of the american taxpayer relief act atra of 2012 documentation and coding adjustment and the required changes to the medicare disproportionate share hospital payments related to the traditional medicare fee for service however it excludes the impact of the sequestration reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below the final rule would also expand cmss policy under which it defines inpatient admissions to include the use of an objective time of care standard specifically it would require medicares external review contractors to presume that hospital inpatient admissions are reasonable and necessary when beneficiaries receive a physician order for admission and receive medically necessary services for at least two midnights the two midnight rule correspondingly under the final rule cms would presume that hospital services spanning less than two midnights should have been provided on an outpatient basis and paid under medicare part b unless the medical record contains clear documentation supporting the physicians order and an expectation that the medicare beneficiary would need medically necessary care for more than two midnights or is receiving services which cms designates as inpatient only our acute care hospitals have begun to comply with the two midnight rule and although we are unable to determine the ultimate impact at this time its application could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations excluding the potential impact of the two midnight rule we do not expect the final ipps 2014 payment rule to have a material impact on our future results of operations in february 2014 cms extended a policy an additional six months where recovery auditor contractors and other medicare review contractors will not conduct postpayment patient status reviews of inpatient hospital claims with dates of admission on or after october 1 2013 through september 30 2014  in august 2012 cms published its final ipps 2013 payment rule which provided for a 26 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule covering the period of october 1 2012 through september 30 2013 approximated 18 the impact from the ipps 2013 final rule reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph however it excludes the impact of potential reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below  in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint committee which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented on march 1 2013 resulting in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 35 million annual reduction to our medicare net revenues effective as of april 1 2013 with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs  on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which among other things includes a requirement for cms to recoup 11 billion from hospitals from medicare ipps rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017 the recoupment relates to ipps documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by cms the 2014 ipps final rule includes a 08 recoupment adjustment as the first step in this recovery process cms expects to make similar adjustments in federal fiscal years 2015 2016 and 2017 in order to recover the entire 11 billion this adjustment is reflected in the 2014 ipps estimated impact amount noted above  on january 1 2005 cms implemented a new psychiatric prospective payment system psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program this system replaced the costbased reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospitals base payment if it maintains a fullservice emergency department in april 2011 cms    66    table of contents  published its final psych pps rule for the fifteen month period july 1 2011 to september 30 2012 the market basket increase for this time

november 2011 cms published its annual final medicare opps rule for 2012 the market basket increase to the opps base rate is 30 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 01 in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 11 in the final rule cms also implemented a significant decrease in the 2012 medicare rates for both hospitalbased and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs when other statutorily required adjustments hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered our overall medicare opps payment decrease for 2012 was estimated to be approximately 07 excluding the behavioral health partial hospitalization rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2012 was approximately 21  we entered into an agreement in april 2012 with the united states department of health and human services the secretary of health and human services and cms referred to collectively as hhs that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately 36 million which was received during 2012 after reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests this settlement favorably impacted our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results by approximately 30 million recording during the first quarter of 2012 this agreement was part of an industrywide settlement with hhs related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in the us were underpaid from the medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years the underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with the balanced budget act of 1997    67    table of contents medicaid medicaid is a joint federalstate funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care most state medicaid payments are made under a ppslike system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities  we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc illinois virginia and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1 or approximately 15 million annually from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012 based upon the state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates will remain relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates  the affordable care act substantially increases the federally and statefunded medicaid insurance program and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized nonmedicaid health plans for lowincome residents not eligible for medicaid starting in 2014 however the supreme court has struck down portions of the affordable care act requiring states to expand their medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding accordingly there can be no assurance that states in which we operate will expand medicaid coverage to individuals at 133 of the federal poverty level facilities in states not opting to expand medicaid coverage under the affordable care act may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments as discussed below we can provide no assurance that further reductions to medicaid revenues particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas hidalgo maverick potter and webb participate in cmsapproved private medicaid supplemental payment upl programs these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with thirdparty hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties our hospitals receive both upl payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from thirdparty affiliated hospitals the upl payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an intergovernmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals we recorded net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of 61 million during 2013 25 million during 2012 and 31 million during 2011 if the applicable hospital district or county makes igts consistent with 2013 levels and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the february 2013 thhsc proposed rule which is discussed below we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately 54 million during the state fiscal year state 2014 which ends on september 30 2014  for state fiscal year 2014 texas medicaid will continue to operate under a cmsapproved section 1115 fiveyear medicaid waiver demonstration program during the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012 the texas health and human services commission thhsc transitioned away from upl payments to new waiver incentive payment programs during the first year of transition which commenced on october 1 2011 thhsc made payments to medicaid upl recipient providers that received payments during the states prior fiscal year during transition years two through five thhsc will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals upl payments are also subject to an aggregate    68    table of contents  statewide caps based on cms approved medicaid waiver amounts in february 2013 thhsc proposed a rule that indicates that any required statewide upl payment reductions will be applied a pro rata basis to all upl payment recipients although our future upl payments in texas may be adversely impacted by this proposed rule we are unable to estimate the potential impact on us since the amount of the statewide pro rata upl payment reduction if any has not yet been determined by thhsc  we incur healthcare related taxes provider taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to i healthcare items or services ii the provision of or the authority to provide the health care items of services or iii the payment for the health care items or services such provider taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state medicaid programs we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases andor lump sum medicaid supplemental payments including the impact of the california oklahoma indiana and ohio programs that were initiated during 2013 or 2012 as mentioned below we earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately 69 million during 2013 58 million during 2012 of which 12 million related to 2011 and 26 million during 2011 from medicaid supplemental payments after assessed provider taxes were considered we estimate that our aggregate net benefit from provider tax programs will approximate 46 million during 2014 the aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular states portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements however provider taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that if reduced from current rates in several states could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations  in california a medicaid state plan amendment spa was submitted to cms by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related medicaid supplemental payment program retroactive to july 1 2011 through december 31 2013 in june 2012 cms approved a portion of the spa which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during 2013 or 2012 in june 2013 cms approved the medicaid managed care component of the spa covering the period of july 1 2011 through june 30 2013 the net aggregate benefit for the period of july 1 2011 through june 30 2013 was 11 million of which 8 million was applicable to prior years which was included in our financial results during the second quarter of 2013 the spa noted above covering the six month period july 1 2013 to december 31 2013 is still subject to cms approval similarly in october 2013 the state of california enacted new legislation sb 239 that would continue the provider tax and related medicaid supplemental payment program for three years effective january 1 2014 and likewise is subject to cms approval as such if these cms approvals are obtained by the state the program impact will be retroactive to july 1 2013 although we cannot predict whether or not cms will ultimately approve these additional programs covering the period of july 1 2013 through december 31 2016 if approved by cms we estimate the average pretax favorable impact on our results of operations to be approximately 10 million annually in january 2012 the state of oklahoma was granted federal approval by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for the supplemental hospital offset payment program shopp which grants the oklahoma health care authority the authority to assess a 25 fee on certain oklahoma hospitals and to make medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through december 31 2014 retroactive to july 1 2011 the state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in march 2012 and our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately 21 million in connection with the shopp program covering the period of july 1 2011 through december 31 2012  during the second quarter of 2012 new supplemental medicaid programs were initiated in indiana and ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately 14 million recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to july 2011      69    table of contents state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of lowincome patients ie those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25 are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments although this legislation and the resulting state broadbased provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program to date the net impact has not been materially adverse  upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolinas low income patients five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each states dsh fund the south carolina and texas dsh programs were renewed for each states 2014 dsh fiscal year covering the period of october 1 2013 through september 30 2014 in september 2013 the thhsc published its 2013 final dsh rule that included changes that resulted in approximately 9 million of additional reimbursements to our acute care facilities located in texas applicable to the states 2013 fiscal year which were included in our 2013 pretax consolidated financial results in connection with these dsh programs included in our financial results was an aggregate of 54 million during 2013 47 million during 2012 and 45 million during 2011 assuming that the texas and south carolina programs are renewed for each states 2015 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2014 fiscal year estimates we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately 49 million during 2014 failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary igts for the states share of the dsh programs failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs or reductions in reimbursements see below could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  the affordable care act provides for a significant reduction in medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in 2016 see below in sources of revenues and health care reformmedicaid revisions for additional disclosure the us department of health and human services is to determine the amount of medicaid dsh payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology as medicaid dsh payments to states will be cut consequently payments to medicaidparticipating providers including our hospitals in texas and south carolina will likely be reduced in the coming years based on the september 2013 cms final rule our medicaid dsh payments in texas and south carolina could be reduced by approximately 4 in the 2016 federal fiscal year this statutorily required reduction was originally scheduled to be implemented in federal fiscal year 2014 but was delayed to ffy 2016 by the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013  in may 2013 the state of texas enacted legislation that would increase the states contribution of the nonfederal dsh share for the 2013 dsh year to 138 million as compared to the 100 million previously expected similarly the states approved 20142015 general appropriations bill passed in may 2013 authorized 160 million for 2014 and 140 million for 2015 respectively for the nonfederal dsh share we expect the 2014 and 2015 dsh year amounts to be comparable to the 2013 dsh year amounts  hitech act in july 2010 the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate will ultimately choose to participate our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria the governments ultimate goal is to promote more effective quality and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system    70    table of contents during 2011 we began implementing ehr applications at certain of our acute care hospitals and continued to do so on a hospitalbyhospital basis until completion which occurred at the end of june 2013 our acute care hospitals are eligible for medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application once they have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable stage or have completed attestations to their adoption or implementation of certified ehr technology with the exception of the newly constructed and recently opened temecula valley hospital we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the stage 1 year one meaningful use criteria  our 2013 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pretax impact of approximately 19 million consisting of approximately 61 million of ehr incentive income less approximately 10 million of salaries wages benefits and other operating expenses approximately 33 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pretax impact of approximately 3 million consisting of approximately 30 million of ehr incentive income less approximately 15 million of salaries wages benefits and other operating expenses approximately 13 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests  federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st  we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by 2015 there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act  managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies which include health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs in general we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate typically we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers however during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies  commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policy holders based upon the particular hospitals established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor  commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms including predetermined payment or drgbased payment systems for more inpatient and outpatient services to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals  other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage such patients are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter for their ability to pay based    71    table of contents  upon federal and state poverty guidelines qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care writeoffs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances  sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of among other things the war on terrorism economic recovery stimulus packages responses to natural disasters the expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations  in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 hr 4872 pl 111152 the reconciliation act and the patient protection and affordable care act pl 111148 the affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant

are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below  implemented medicare reductions and reforms            the reconciliation act reduced the market basket update for

competition among private health insurers by providing for transparent federal and state insurance exchanges starting in 2014 the affordable care act also prohibits private insurers from adjusting insurance premiums based on health status gender or other specified factors we cannot provide assurance that these provisions will not adversely affect the ability of private insurers to pay for services provided to insured patients or that these changes will not have a negative material impact on our results of operations going forward  valuebased purchasing  there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services these valuebased purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events  the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing the affordable care act prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions hac beginning in ffy 2015 hospitals that fall into the top 25 of national riskadjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1 reduction in their total medicare payments hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard  the affordable care act also required hhs to implement a valuebased purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on october 1 2012 the affordable care act requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1 in ffy 2013 and increasing by 025 each fiscal year up to 2 in ffy 2017 and subsequent years hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions in its fiscal year 2014 ipps final rule cms will fund the 2014 valuebased purchasing program by reducing base operating drg payment amounts to participating hospitals by 125  readmission reduction program  in the affordable care act congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program hrrp the hrrp assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates when compared to expected rates effective for discharges beginning october 1

methodology to calculate the hospital readmission payment adjustment factor and what portion of the ipps payment is used to calculate the readmission adjustment factor in the fiscal year 2014 ipps final rule cms finalized revisions to the three 30day admission measures in the program  heart failure myocardial infarction and pneumonia  to exclude planned readmissions under the affordable care act beginning in fiscal year 2015 cms will expand the program and add two readmission measures one acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and two patients admitted for elective total hip arthroplasty tha and total knee arthroplasty tka we do not believe impact of hrrp for federal fiscal years 2013 and 2014 had or will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  accountable care organizations  the affordable care act requires hhs to establish a medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations acos the aco program allows providers including hospitals physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services the program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established by hhs will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the medicare program  in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations postpayment audits requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years because of audits by the program representatives providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments nevertheless until final adjustments are made certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required  finally we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations  other operating results  combined net revenues and incomelosses before income taxes from our surgical hospitals ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013 2012 or 2011    74    table of contents interest expense

revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year this seasonality occurs because generally more people become ill during the winter months which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months  inflationinflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years however since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply and other costs we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal state and local laws which have been enacted that in certain cases limit our ability to increase prices we believe however that through adherence to cost containment policies labor management and reasonable price

debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction  derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement  for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future  the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance however at december 31 2013 each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  during 2011 we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 450 million from december 2011 to december 2012 reducing to 400 million from december 2012 to december 2013 whereby we paid a premium of 740000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 700 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 700 during the term of the cap the threemonth libor never reached 700 during the term of the cap which expired in december 2013 and therefore no payment was made to us  we also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 425 million and receive threemonth libor three of these swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million became

statements  1 business and summary of significant accounting policies  services provided by our hospitals all of which are operated by subsidiaries of ours include general and specialty surgery internal medicine obstetrics emergency room care radiology oncology diagnostic care coronary care pediatric services pharmacy services andor behavioral health services we through our subsidiaries provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities including central purchasing information services finance and control systems facilities planning physician recruitment services administrative personnel management marketing and public relations  the more significant accounting policies follow  a principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majorityowned subsidiaries and partnerships controlled by us or our subsidiaries as the managing general partner all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated  b revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 38 of our net patient revenues during 2013 39 during 2012 and 41 during 2011 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 49 of our net patient revenues during each of 2013 and 2012 and 47 during 2011  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record  we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2013 2012 or 2011  we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care and uninsured discounts for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care    107    table of contents c provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort  uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30 of total charges our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay  our accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 includes amounts due from illinois of approximately 49 million 70 million and 54 million respectively collection of the outstanding receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures approximately 28 million as of december 31 2013 51 million as of december 31 2012 and 41 million as of december 31 2011 of the receivables due from illinois were outstanding in excess of 60 days as of each respective date in addition our accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 includes approximately 46 million due from texas in connection with medicaid supplemental payment programs the majority of which we expect to collect during the second quarter of 2014 although the accounts receivable due from illinois and texas could remain outstanding for the foreseeable future since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us we have received 27 million of cash remittances from illinois in january 2014 no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois andor texas failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from these states would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows  on a consolidated basis we monitor our total selfpay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 395 million and 311 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively  d concentration of revenues our five majority owned acute care hospitals in the las vegas nevada market contributed on a combined basis 14 of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2013 and 2012 and 15 in 2011 on a combined basis our facilities in the mcallenedinburg texas market consisting of three acute care facilities a childrens hospital and a behavioral health facility contributed 4 of our consolidated net revenues in each of 2013 and 2012 and 5 in 2011  e charity care and uninsured discounts a significant portion of the patients treated throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals are uninsured patients which in part has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance or who have policies with relatively high deductibles patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective services who have gross income less than 400 of the federal poverty guidelines are deemed eligible for charity care the federal poverty guidelines are established by the federal government and are based on income and family size because we do not pursue collection of amounts that qualify as charity care they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable net we also provide discounts to uninsured patients included in uninsured discounts amounts    108    table of contents  below who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care because we do not pursue collection of amounts classified as uninsured discounts they are not reported in our net revenues or in our accounts receivable net in implementing the discount policy we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for governmental programs charity care or any other discount program if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs the uninsured discount is applied  uncompensated care  the following table shows the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011                                    dollar amounts in thousands        2013     2012     2011        amount

estimated cost of providing uncompensated care  the estimated cost of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the abovementioned total uncompensated care amounts the percentage of cost to gross charges is calculated based on the total operating expenses for our acute care facilities divided by gross patient service revenue for those facilities an increase in the level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in the provision for doubtful accounts and uncompensated care provided could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results                        amounts in

medicaid electronic health records incentive payments in july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available  medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the    109    table of contents  applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals met the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurred in the period in which the applicable hospitals were deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid ehr incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods medicaid ehr incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria were included in other current liabilities as deferred ehr incentive income in our

assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates  j goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated september 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september 1 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets there were also no impairments during 2012 or 2011 future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review including profitability and market value projections could indicate impairment in future periods

swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts  we account for our derivative and hedging activities

objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction  derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other

liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within stockholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings  we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the

currently in the income statement  derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the

determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows    113    table of contents  of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items

requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date any excess of the purchase price consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill transaction costs and

hedges  during 2013 2012 and 2011 we had no fair value hedges outstanding  cash flow hedges  we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction  derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement  for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future  the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2013 and 2012 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance however at december 31 2013 each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  during 2011 we entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 450 million from december 2011 to december 2012 reducing to 400 million from december 2012 to december 2013 whereby we paid a premium of 740000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 700 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 700 during the term of the cap the threemonth libor never reached 700 during the term of the cap which expired in december 2013 and therefore no payment was made to us  we also entered into six forward starting interest rate swaps in 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 425 million and receive threemonth libor three of these swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million became effective in march 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate    119    table of contents  payable on these swaps is 191 the three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of 75 million 25 million and 100 million became effective in december 2011 and have corresponding fixed rates of 132 196 and 250 the 75 million and 25 million interest rate swaps matured in december 2012 and december 2013 respectively and the 100 million interest rate swap is scheduled to mature in december 2014  during 2010 we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 600 million and receive threemonth libor each of the four swaps became effective in december 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 238  during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we paid a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of 150 million and received threemonth libor each of the two interest rate swaps which are now expired had an initial notional principal amount of 75 million the fixed rate payable on one of the interest rate swaps was 487 and it matured in october 2011 the fixed rate payable on the other interest rate swap on which the notional principal amount reduced to 50 million in october 2010 was 476 and it matured in october 2012  we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 24 million at december 31 2013 of which 19 million is included in other current liabilities and 5 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet at december 31 2012 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 41 million substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet  4 longterm debt  a summary of

to mature on november 15 2015 the second amendment also provides for increased flexibility for refinancing and certain other modifications but substantially all other terms of the credit agreement remain unchanged  in september 2012 we used 700 million of the proceeds from the new term loan a2 facility to extinguish a portion of our higher priced term loanb facility pricing under the new term loan a2 facility was 1 lower than the term loanb facility and did not include a libor floor whereas at that time the term loanb facility had a 1 libor floor which has since been eliminated as part of

available evidence it is more likely than not that certain of our state tax benefits will not be realized therefore valuation allowances of approximately 44 million and 41 million have been reflected as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2013 the valuation allowance on these state tax benefits increased by approximately 3 million due to additional net operating losses incurred in addition valuation allowances of approximately 3 million have been reflected as of december 31 2013 and 2012 related to foreign net operating losses there were no significant increases in valuation allowances as a result of the acquisition of ascend health corporation  we adopted the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective january 1 2007 during 2013 and 2012 the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were increased less than 1 million due to tax positions taken in the current and prior years during 2013 the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties were reduced due to the lapse of the statute of limitations resulting in a net income tax benefit of approximately 1 million the balance at each of december 31 2013 and 2012 if subsequently recognized that would favorably affect the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes is approximately 2 million and 4 million respectively  we recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we have accrued interest and penalties of less than 1 million as of each date the us federal statute of limitations remains open for the 2010 and subsequent years foreign and us state and local jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging for 3 to 4 years the statute of limitations on certain jurisdictions could expire within the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months however it is anticipated that any such change if it were to occur would not have a material impact on our results of

arrangements that will likely result in future lease and rental expense in excess of amounts indicated above  8 commitments and contingencies  professional and general liability workers compensation liability and property insurance  professional and general liability and workers compensation liability  effective january 1 2008 most of our subsidiaries became selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per occurrence prior to our acquisition of psychiatric solutions inc psi in november 2010 our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of 10 million up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate however we are liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  prior to our acquisition in november 2010 the psi subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a 3 million selfinsured retention to a limit of 75 million psi utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of psi to manage the selfinsured retention for all former psi subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to january 1 2011 the captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims regardless of date incurred for the former psi subsidiaries located in florida and puerto rico  since our acquisition of psi on november 15 2010 the former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries which are not former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per occurrence effective november 2010 our subsidiaries including the former psi subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence selfinsured retention either 3 million or 10 million up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate we remain liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate the 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from ascend health corporation in october 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to 20 million of    132    table of contents  aggregate coverage subject to a 25000 per occurrence deductible these facilities like our other facilities are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to 250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 206 million of which 44 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 279 million of which 48 million is included in current liabilities  we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to 81 million during 2013 27 million during 2012 and 11 million during 2011 the favorable change in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2013 relating to years prior to 2013 were due primarily to i an increased weighting given to companyspecific metrics to 100 from 75 and decreased general industry metrics to 0 from 25 related to projected incidents per exposure historical claims experience and loss development factors ii historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate and iii a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the companywide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years as the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased thereby providing for a statistically significant data group and taking into consideration our longhistory of companyspecific risk management programs and claims experience our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends the favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis the favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of thirdparty recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with phicorelated claims which we became liable for upon phicos a former commercial insurance carrier liquidation in 2002  as of december 31 2013 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 64 million of which 34 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our workers compensation liability claims was 66 million of which 35 million is included in current liabilities the adjustments recorded during the last three years to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011  property insurance  we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses including windstorm damage up to a 1 billion policy limit per occurrence subject to a 250000 deductible for the majority of our

total insurable value of the property in addition we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting    133    table of contents  from earthquake and flood damage each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is 250 million subject to a deductible of 250000 except for facilities located within documented fault zones earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the united states are subject to a 100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1 to 5 of the declared total insurable value of the property the earthquake limit in puerto rico is 25 million subject to a 25000 deductible noncritical flood losses have either a 250000 or 500000 deductible based upon the location of the facility since certain of our facilities have been designated by our insurer as flood prone we have elected to purchase policies from the national flood insurance program to cover a substantial portion of the applicable deductible  legal proceedings  we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to litigation as outlined below  office of inspector general oig and other government investigations  in september 2010 we along with many other companies in the healthcare

against psi and the former directors in 2009 alleging violations of federal securities laws we intend to defend the case vigorously should we be deemed liable in this matter we believe we would be entitled to commercial insurance recoveries for amounts paid by us subject to certain limitations and deductibles included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013 and 2012 is an estimated reserve current liability and corresponding commercial insurance recovery current asset which did not have a material impact on our financial statements although we believe the commercial insurance recoveries are adequate to satisfy potential liability and related legal fees in connection with this matter we can provide no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the commercial insurance recoveries which would make us liable for the excess  department of justice investigation of friends hospital  in october 2010 friends hospital in philadelphia pennsylvania

treatment centers operated in the commonwealth of virginia to confirm compliance with provider rules under the states medicaid provider services manual manual as a result of those audits dmas claims the facilities failed to comply with the requirements of the manual and has requested repayment of medicaid payments to those facilities psi had previously filed appeals to repayment demands at each facility which are currently pending we had previously agreed to a settlement of this matter which was approved by virginia state officials during the first quarter of 2014 the aggregate refund of medicaid payments made to those facilities as requested by dmas and the settlement amount is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations  general  the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include among other things matters such as government healthcare participation requirements various licensure certifications and accreditations reimbursement for patient services and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse government    135    table of contents  action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes andor regulations by healthcare providers currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices including ours although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations there is no assurance that we will not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties in connection with such inquiries or actions including with respect to the investigations and other matters discussed herein even if we were to ultimately prevail such inquiries andor actions could have a material adverse effect on us  the outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations including the matters described above cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors including but not limited to i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate ii discovery is not complete iii the proceeding is in its early stages iv the matters present legal uncertainties v there are significant facts in dispute vi there are a large number of parties or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes it is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial position cash flows and potentially our reputation  in addition various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations  in addition to our longterm debt obligations as discussed in note 4longterm debt and our operating lease obligations as
