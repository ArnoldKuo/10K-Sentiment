selfreferral and antikickback legislation if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we also operate health care facilities in the united kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and as a result are subject to certain us and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally including anticorruption laws the foreign corrupt practices act regulates us companies in their dealings with foreign officials prohibiting bribes and similar practices and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls in addition the united kingdom bribery act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the united kingdom we are subject to occupational health safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations regulatory requirements affecting us include but are not limited to those covering i air and water quality control ii occupational health and safety eg standards regarding bloodborne pathogens and ergonomics etc iii waste management iv the handling of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances and v other hazardous materials if we fail to comply with those standards we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits product liability lawsuits class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters we may choose to negotiate a settlement amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations we believe that based on our past experience and actuarial estimates our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals while we continuously monitor our coverage our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance it could have a material adverse effect on our operations we may be subject to governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government and as a result the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware please see item 3 legal proceedings for disclosure of current related matters the failure of certain employers or the closure of certain facilities could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals the economies in the nonurban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care the failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them the occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations thereby harming our business   17  if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid the construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation relating to among other things the adequacy of medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures fire prevention ratesetting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection additionally such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards all of our hospitals are deemed certified meaning that they are accredited properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program the effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal state local and other relevant regulations and standards however should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected our growth strategy depends in part on acquisitions and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from notforprofit entities due to regulatory scrutiny acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit healthcare companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do also suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms in addition many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that affect the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a healthcare facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations further the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations depending on various factors including the amount paid for the acquisition the acquired hospitals results of operations allocation of the purchase price effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel in addition acquisition activity requires transitions from and the integration of operations and usually information systems that are used by acquired hospitals in addition some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals our results of operations could be harmed   the trend toward valuebased purchasing may negatively impact our revenues    we believe that valuebased purchasing initiatives of both governmental and private payers tying financial incentives to quality and efficiency of care will increasingly affect the results of operations of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities and may negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet expected quality standards the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing in federal healthcare programs medicare now requires providers to report certain quality measures in order to receive full reimbursement increases for inpatient and outpatient procedures that were previously awarded automatically in addition hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive increased reimbursement payments and hospitals that have excess readmissions for specified conditions will receive reduced reimbursement furthermore medicare no longer pays hospitals additional amounts for the treatment of certain hospitalacquired conditions unless the conditions were present at admission beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 hospitals that rank in the worst 25 of all hospitals nationally for hospital acquired conditions in the previous year will receive reduced medicare reimbursements the aca also    18  prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for treating certain providerpreventable conditions    there is a trend among private payers toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services as well many large commercial payers require hospitals to report quality data and several of these payers will not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events we expect valuebased purchasing programs including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations but it could negatively impact our revenues if we are unable to meet quality standards established by both governmental and private payers  if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities we could become liable for material obligations hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities including but not limited to liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire such liabilities and related legal or other costs andor resulting damage to a facilitys reputation could harm our business our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions see item 3legal proceedings in addition we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies both known and unknown which may relate to past present and future facts events circumstances and occurrences should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity following the merger and our ability to achieve expected benefits of the merger in particular government investigations as well as qui tam lawsuits may lead to material fines penalties damages payments or other sanctions including exclusion from government healthcare programs settlements of lawsuits involving medicare and medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need or con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition expansion or replacement make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs result in the revocation of a facilitys license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us any of which could harm our business in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues controls imposed by thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as utilization review have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations   19  our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors including physicians clinical decisions and availability payor programs shifting to a more outpatientbased environment whether or not certain services are offered seasonal and severe weather conditions including the effects of extreme low temperatures hurricanes and tornados earthquakes current local economic and demographic changes in addition technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business  if a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets our business could be adversely affected such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose or that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases if any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities further a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols the potential impact of a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business  a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations our patient volumes revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets worsening of economic conditions may result in a higher unemployment rate which may increase the number of individuals without health insurance as a result our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes particularly in less intense more elective service lines or an increase in services provided to uninsured patients these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes revenues and operating results in addition as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 360 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet should the revenues and financial results of our acute care andor behavioral health care facilities be materially unfavorably impacted due to among other things a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results fluctuations in our operating results quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and as a result there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized in addition to our operating results many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein demographic changes operating results of other hospital companies changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts speculation in the press or investment community the possible effects of war terrorist and other hostilities adverse weather conditions the level of seasonal illnesses managed care contract negotiations and terminations changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the health care industry our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling because a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in pounds we monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk while we may elect to enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection and our results of operations could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations   20  we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price as a publicly traded company we are subject to a significant body of regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations for example we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form 10k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions fines or other sanctions or litigation if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting our stock price could decline a cyber security incident could cause a violation of hipaa breach of member privacy or other negative impacts we rely extensively on our information technology it systems to manage clinical and financial data communicate with our patients payors vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results in addition we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize electronic health records and to become meaningful users of health information technology pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 a cyberattack that bypasses our it security systems causing an it security breach loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws loss of proprietary business information or a material disruption of our it business systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and result of operations in addition our future results of operations as well as our reputation could be adversely impacted by theft destruction loss or misappropriation of public health information other confidential data or proprietary business information different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition generally accepted accounting principles are complex continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased as we continue to invest in modern technologies emergency rooms and operating room expansions the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation expansion construction and addition of medical equipment and technology we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand improve and equip our existing hospitals we cannot predict however whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed which could harm our business to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate longterm debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition   21  in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business the expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient quality healthcare services at our facilities which could harm our business the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock is subject to potential increases or decreases at december 31 2015 241 million shares of class b common stock were reserved for issuance upon conversion of shares of class a c and d common stock outstanding for issuance upon exercise of options to purchase class b common stock and for issuance of stock under other incentive plans class a c and d common stock are convertible on a share for share basis into class b common stock to the extent that these shares were converted into or exercised for shares of class b common stock the number of shares of class b common stock available for trading in the public market place would increase substantially and the current holders of class b common stock would own a smaller percentage of that class in addition from timetotime our board of directors approve stock repurchase programs authorizing us to purchase shares of our class b common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market such repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock conversely as a potential means of generating additional funds to operate and expand our business we may from timetotime issue equity through the sale of stock which would increase the number of outstanding shares of our class b common stock based upon factors such as but not limited to the market price of our stock interest rate on borrowings and uses or potential uses for cash repurchase or issuance of our stock could have a dilutive effect on our future basic and diluted earnings per share the right to elect the majority of our board of directors and the majority of the general shareholder voting power resides with the holders of class a and c common stock the majority of which is owned by alan b miller our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors our restated certificate of incorporation provides that with respect to the election of directors holders of class a common stock vote as a class with the holders of class c common stock and holders of class b common stock vote as a class with holders of class d common stock with holders of all classes of our common stock entitled to one vote per share as of march 26 2015 the shares of class a and class c common stock constituted 73 of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock had the right to elect five members of the board of directors and constituted 861 of our general voting power as of that date as of march 26 2015 the shares of class b and class d common stock excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options constituted 927 of the outstanding shares of our common stock had the right to elect two members of the board of directors and constituted 139 of our general voting power as of that date as to matters other than the election of directors our restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of class a class b class c and class d common stock all vote together as a single class except as otherwise provided by law each share of class a common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote each share of class b common stock entitles the holder thereof to onetenth of a vote each share of class c common stock entitles the holder thereof to 100 votes provided the holder of class c common stock holds a number of shares of class a common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class c common stock that holder holds and each share of class d common stock entitles the holder thereof to ten votes provided the holder of class d common stock holds a number of shares of class b common stock equal to ten times the number of shares of class d common stock that holder holds in the event a holder of class c or class d common stock holds a number of shares of class a or class b common stock respectively less than ten times the number of shares of class c or class d common stock that holder holds then that holder will be entitled to only one vote for every share of class c common stock or onetenth of a vote for every share of class d common stock which that holder holds in excess of onetenth the number of shares of class a or class b common stock respectively held by that holder the board of directors in its discretion may require beneficial owners to provide satisfactory evidence that such owner holds    22  ten times as many shares of class a or class b common stock as class c or class d common stock respectively if such facts are not apparent from our stock records since a substantial majority of the class a shares and class c shares are controlled by mr alan b miller and members of his family one of whom marc d miller is also a director and officer of our company and they can elect a majority of our companys directors and effect or reject most actions requiring approval by stockholders without the vote of any other stockholders there are potential conflicts of interest in overseeing the management of our company in addition because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses our business and

behavioral health in accordance with federal regulations regarding suspension of payments during certain investigations the florida agency for health care administration subsequently issued a medicaid payment suspension for the facility river point behavioral health submitted a rebuttal statement disputing the basis of the suspension and requesting revocation of the suspension notwithstanding cms continued the payment suspension river point behavioral health provided additional information to cms in an effort to obtain relief from the payment suspension but the suspension remains in effect in august 2015 we received notification from cms that effective september 2015 the payment suspension will be continued for another 180 days we cannot predict if andor when the facilitys suspended payments will resume although the operating results of river point behavioral health did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during the years ended december 31 2015 or 2014 the payment suspension has had a material adverse effect on the facilitys results of operations and financial condition   29  in june 2013 the oig served a subpoena on coastal harbor health

facilities have not received any requests for documentation or other information  the doj has advised us that the civil aspect of the coordinated investigation referenced above is a false claim act investigation focused on billings submitted to government payers in relation to services provided at those facilities at present we are uncertain as to potential liability andor financial exposure of the company andor named facilities if any in connection with these matters in december 2015 we were advised that the doj opened an investigation involving the el paso behavioral health system in el paso texas the doj is investigating potential stark law violations relating to arrangements between the facility and physicians at the facility these agreements were entered into before we acquired the facility as a part of our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october 2012 to our knowledge this matter is not a part of the omnibus investigation referenced above at present we are uncertain as to potential liability andor financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter  in january 2016 we were notified that the department of justice opened an investigation of the south texas health system of a potential false claim act case regarding compensation paid to cardiologists pursuant to employment agreements entered into in 2005 at present we are uncertain as to potential liability andor financial exposure if any which may be associated with this matter regulatory matters on july 23 2015 timberlawn mental health system timberlawn received notification from cms of its intent to terminate timberlawns medicare provider agreement effective august 7 2015 this notification resulted from surveys conducted which alleged that timberlawn was out of compliance with conditions of participation required for participation in the medicaremedicaid program we filed a request for expedited administrative appeal with the us department of health and human services departmental appeals board civil remedies division seeking review and reversal of the termination action in conjunction with the administrative appeal we filed litigation in the us district court for the northern district of texas seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to have the termination stayed pending the conclusion of the administrative appeal the trial court denied timberlawns request for a temporary restraining order and dismissed the case timberlawns provider agreement was terminated effective august 14 2015 in september 2015 timberlawn reached an agreement with cms relative to its reapplication to the medicaremedicaid program in exchange timberlawn agreed to dismiss its administrative appeal as well as not to pursue an appeal of the decision of the trial court during this time timberlawn has remained open in december 2015 timberlawn received notice from the texas department of state health services of its intent to revoke timberlawns license and impose an administrative penalty we have appealed and are contesting the proposed revocation and fine in january 2016 timberlawn submitted its application for reenrollment into the medicaremedicaid program although the operating results of timberlawn did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the years ended december 31 2015 or 2014 the termination of timberlawns provider agreement has had a material adverse effect on the facilitys results of operations and financial condition   30  during the second quarter of 2015 texoma medical center texoma which includes tmc behavioral health center entered into a systems improvement agreement sia with cms the sia abated a termination action from cms following surveys which identified alleged failures to comply with conditions of participation primarily involving texomas behavioral health operations the terms of the sia required texoma to engage independent consultantsexperts approved by cms to analyze and develop implementation plans at texoma to meet medicare conditions of participation at the conclusion of the sia cms will conduct a full certification survey to determine if texoma is in substantial compliance with the medicare conditions of participation the term of agreement is set to conclude october 2 2016 unless the terms of the agreement are fulfilled earlier during the term of the sia texoma remains eligible to receive reimbursements from medicare and medicaid for services rendered to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries other matters in late september 2015 many hospitals in pennsylvania including seven of our behavioral health care hospitals located in the state received letters from the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw demanding repayment of allegedly excess medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments dsh for the federal fiscal year 2011 ffy2011 amounting to approximately 4 million in the aggregate we have filed administrative appeals for all of our facilities contesting the recoupment efforts since we believe dpws calculation methodology is inaccurate and conflicts with applicable federal and state laws and regulations dpw has agreed to postpone the recoupment of the states share of the dsh payments until all hospital appeals are resolved dpw also extended the deadline to recoup the federal share 2011 federal share is 55 until april 30 2016 however if dpw is ultimately successful in its demand related to ffy2011 it could take similar action with regards to ffy2012 through ffy2014 due to a change in the pennsylvania medicaid state plan and implementation of a cmsapproved medicaid section 1115 waiver we do not believe the methodology applied by dpw to ffy2011 is applicable to reimbursements received for medicaid services provided after january 1 2015 by our behavioral health care facilities located in pennsylvania we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our legal and administrative appeals related to dpws repayment demands if our legal and administrative appeals are unsuccessful our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by these repayments  matters relating to psychiatric solutions inc psi the following matters pertain to psi or former psi facilities owned by subsidiaries of psi which were in existence prior to the acquisition of psi and for which we have assumed the defense as a result of our acquisition which was completed in november 2010 department of

documents were collected and provided to the doj for review and examination another subpoena was issued to the facility in july 2011 requesting additional documents which have also been delivered to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter department of justice investigation of riveredge hospital in 2008 riveredge hospital in chicago illinois received a subpoena from the doj requesting certain information from the facility additional requests for documents were also received from the doj in 2009 and 2010 the requested documents have been provided to the doj all documents requested and produced pertained to the operations of the facility while under psis ownership prior to our acquisition at present we are uncertain as to the focus scope or extent of the investigation liability of the facility andor potential financial exposure if any in connection with this matter general we operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry which subjects us to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations these claims or suits include claims for damages for personal injuries medical malpractice commercialcontractual disputes wrongful restriction of or interference with physicians staff privileges and employment related claims in addition health care companies are subject to investigations andor actions by various state and federal governmental agencies or those bringing claims on their behalf government action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations against healthcare providers concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes as well as compliance with clinical and operational regulations currently and from time to time we and some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries in the form of subpoenas civil investigative demands audits and other document requests from various federal and state agencies these inquiries can lead to notices andor actions including repayment obligations from state and federal government agencies associated with potential noncompliance with laws and regulations further the federal false claim act allows private individuals to bring lawsuits qui tam actions against healthcare providers that submit claims for payments to the government various states have also adopted similar statutes when such a claim is filed the government will investigate the matter and decide if they are going to intervene in the pending case these qui tam lawsuits are placed under seal by the court to comply with    31  the false claims acts requirements if the government chooses not to intervene the private individuals can proceed independently on behalf of the government health care providers that are found to violate the false claims act may be subject to substantial monetary finespenalties as well as face potential exclusion from participating in government health care programs or be required to comply with corporate integrity agreements as a condition of a settlement of a false claim act matter in september 2014 the criminal division of the doj announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened the doj has also announced an intention to pursue civil and criminal actions against individuals within a company as well as the corporate entity or entities in addition health care facilities are subject to monitoring by state and federal surveyors to ensure compliance with program conditions of participation in the event a facility is found to be out of compliance with a condition of participation and unable to remedy the alleged deficiencys the facility faces termination from the medicare and medicaid programs or compliance with a system improvement agreement to remedy deficiencies and ensure compliance the laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry are complex covering among other things government healthcare participation requirements licensure certification and accreditation privacy of patient information reimbursement for patient services as well as fraud and abuse compliance these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and expanding further the affordable care act has added additional obligations on healthcare providers to report and refund overpayments by government healthcare programs and authorizes the suspension of medicare and medicaid payments pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud we monitor our business and have developed an ethics and compliance program with respect to these complex laws rules and regulations although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with government regulations there is no assurance that we will not be faced with the sanctions referenced above which include fines penalties andor substantial damages repayment obligations payment suspensions licensure revocation and expulsion from government healthcare programs even if we were to ultimately prevail in any action brought against us or our facilities or in responding to any inquiry such action or inquiry could have a material adverse effect on us the outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations including the matters described above cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors including but not limited to i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate ii discovery is not complete iii the proceeding is in its early stages iv the matters present legal uncertainties v there are significant facts in dispute vi there are a large number of parties or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes it is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial position cash flows and potentially our reputation in addition various suits and claims arising against us in the ordinary course of business are pending in the opinion of management the outcome of such claims and litigation will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations     item 4  mine safety disclosures not applicable     32  part ii     item 5  market for registrants common equity
