 on a combined basis these facilities contributed 17 in 2015 and 18 in both 2014 and 2013 of our consolidated net revenues on a    11  combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 11 in 2015 17 in 2014 and 15 in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest nevada we own 6 inpatient acute care hospitals and 4 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 15 in 2015 16 in 2014 and 15 in 2013 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 10 in 2015 11 in 2014 and 6 in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest california we own 5 inpatient acute care hospitals and 8 inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 11 in 2015 10 in 2014 and 9 in 2013 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 11 in 2015 8 in 2014 and 4 in 2013 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest the significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in texas nevada and california any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors we derive a significant portion of our revenue from thirdparty payors including the medicare and medicaid programs changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and in some cases reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities we are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of among other things the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs in addition the vast majority of the net revenues generated at our behavioral health facilities located in the united kingdom are derived from governmental payors if the rates paid or the scope of services covered by governmental payors in the united states or united kingdom are reduced there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas washington dc california nevada illinois pennsylvania virginia massachusetts and florida making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states  in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors including managed care providers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals private payors including managed care providers increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations reductions or changes in medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations on january 3 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the 2012 act the 2012 act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the budget control act of 2011 the postponed sequestration cuts include a 2 annual reduction over ten years in medicare spending to providers medicaid is exempt from sequestration in order to offset the costs of the legislation the 2012 act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost 26 billion over ten years approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in medicare reimbursement to hospitals although the bipartisan budget act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestrationrelated budgetary cuts spending reductions related to the medicare program remain in place on december 26 2013 president obama signed into law hj res 59 the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which includes the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 the act in addition on february 15 2014 public law 113082 was enacted the act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programsincluding medicarefor another three years through 2024 please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenuemedicare for additional disclosure   12  the 2012 act includes a document and coding dci adjustment and a reduction in medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments expected to save 105 billion over 10 years the dci adjustment decreases projected medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases these reductions are meant to recoup what medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to medicare severity diagnosis related groups the reduction in medicaid dsh payments is expected to save 42 billion over 10 years this provision extends the changes regarding dsh payments established by the legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform on march 23 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 the reconciliation act which contains a number of amendments to the ppaca was signed into law on march 30 2010 two primary goals of the ppaca combined with the reconciliation act collectively referred to as the legislation are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses although it is expected that as a result of the legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable the legislation makes a number of other changes to medicare and medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us it has been projected that the legislation will result in a net reduction in medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals totaling 155 billion over 10 years the legislation revises reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals the legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019 a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning october 1 2011 for medicare part b reimbursable items and services and beginning october 1 2012 for medicare inpatient hospital services the legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both medicare dsh and medicaid dsh payments the medicare dsh reductions began in october 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while medicaid dsh reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016 the legislation implements a valuebased purchasing program which will reward the delivery of efficient care conversely certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospitalacquired condition rates a 2012 us supreme court ruling limited the federal governments ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain medicaid coverage requirements pursuant to that decision the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing medicaid funding therefore states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of federal medicaid funding as a result many states including texas have not expanded their medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding there have been several attempts in congress to repeal or modify various provisions of the legislation we cannot predict whether or not any of these proposed changes to the ppaca will become law and therefore can provide no assurance that changes to the legislation as currently implemented will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  in addition in king vs burwell the supreme court decided in favor of the federal governments ability to subsidize premiums paid by certain eligible individuals that obtain health insurance policies through federally facilitated exchanges a number of our hospitals operate in states that utilize federally facilitated exchanges the supreme courts decision in this case ultimately preserved the viability of federally facilitated exchanges a different decision by the supreme court could have resulted in an increased number of uninsured patients generally including an increase of uninsured patients treated at our hospitals located in these states  the various provisions in the legislation that directly or indirectly affect medicare and medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years the impact of the legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations interpretive guidance and possible future legislation or legal challenges certain legislation provisions such as those creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future thus we cannot predict the impact of the legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations the legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare the legislation amends several existing laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers while congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the antikickback statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law the legislation also provides that any    13  claims for items or services that violate the antikickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil false claims act the legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil false claims act although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending the legislation also expands the recovery audit contractor program to medicaid these amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities these investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician selfreferral law the legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physicianowned hospitals and restricts the ability of physicianowned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities the impact of the legislation on each of our hospitals may vary because legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years we anticipate that many of the provisions in the legislation may be subject to further revision we cannot predict the impact the legislation may have on our business results of operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the legislation we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as well as the emergency medical treatment and active labor act or emtala we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor andor seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patients medical condition within the facilitys capability or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospitals written procedures our obligations under emtala may increase substantially going forward cms has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request if the number of indigent and charity care patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under emtala is proposed and adopted our results of operations will be harmed if we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors in recent years the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased cms publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the medicare program federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported additionally the legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services if any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys or results that are lower than our competitors or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing this circumstance could harm our business and results of operations an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations collection of receivables from thirdparty payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patients responsibility which primarily includes copayments and deductibles however we also have substantial receivables due to us as of december 31 2015 a significant portion of which is past due from certain statebased funding programs most particularly illinois and texas as discussed herein we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix the agings of the receivables historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted significant changes in business office operations payor mix economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable cash flow and results of operations if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses our results of operations will be harmed   14  our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers the healthcare industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sales and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we the number of inpatient facilities as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly as a result most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment if our competitors are better able to attract patients recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment as a result the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline it may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the nonurban communities in which our hospitals are located our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations generally the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions the loss of one or more of these physicians even if temporary could cause a material reduction in our revenues which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected the technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and as a result manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers to compete effectively we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur if our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry patients may seek treatment from other providers andor physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business if we fail to continue to meet the meaningful use criteria related to electronic health record systems ehr our operations could be harmed pursuant to hitech regulations hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year we believe that all of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria and therefore are not subject to a reduced market basked update to the ipps standardized amount in federal fiscal year 2015 however under the hitech act hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations   15  our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff if our general labor and related expenses increase we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized it is possible our labor costs could increase materially if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal state and local government levels relating to among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services relationships with physicians and other referral sources adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services ownership of facilities qualifications of medical and support personnel confidentiality maintenance privacy and security issues associated with healthrelated information and patient medical records the screening stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions certification licensure and accreditation of our facilities operating policies and procedures and construction or expansion of facilities and services among these laws are the federal false claims act the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the federal antikickback statute and the provision of the social security act commonly known as the stark law these laws and particularly the antikickback statute and the stark law impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities including employment contracts leases and professional service agreements we also provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the antikickback statute a number of our current arrangements including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the antikickback statute failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the antikickback statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the antikickback statute cms published a medicare selfreferral disclosure protocol which is intended to allow providers to selfdisclose actual or potential violations of the stark law because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the stark law there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the stark law or that selfdisclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties federal regulations issued under hipaa contain provisions that require us to implement and in the future may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patients health and related financial information such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative physical and technical requirements on us restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf additionally recent changes to hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation in the future it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment    16  personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws see item 3legal proceedings or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be see item 1 businessselfreferral and antikickback legislation if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we also operate health care facilities in the united kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and as a result are subject to certain us and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally including anticorruption laws the foreign corrupt practices act regulates us companies in their dealings with foreign officials prohibiting bribes and similar practices and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls in addition the united kingdom bribery act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the united kingdom we are subject to occupational health safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations regulatory requirements affecting us include but are not limited to those covering i air and water quality control ii occupational health and safety eg standards regarding bloodborne pathogens and ergonomics etc iii waste management iv the handling of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances and v other hazardous materials if we fail to comply with those standards we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits product liability lawsuits class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters we may choose to negotiate a settlement amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations we believe that based on our past experience and actuarial estimates our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals while we continuously monitor our coverage our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance it could have a material adverse effect on our operations we may be subject to governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government and as a result the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware please see
