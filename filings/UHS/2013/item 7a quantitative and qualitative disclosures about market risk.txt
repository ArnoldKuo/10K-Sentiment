   we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction    87    table of contents derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement  for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future  the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2012 and 2011 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance however at december 31 2012 each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  during the first quarter of 2011 we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 275 million whereby we paid a premium of 30000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 225 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 225 during the term of the cap which expired in december 2011 the threemonth libor never reached 225 during the term of the cap therefore no payment was made to us we also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 450 million from december 2011 to december 2012 reducing to 400 million from december 2012 to december 2013 whereby we paid a premium of 740000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 700 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 700 during the term of the cap if the threemonth libor does not reach 700 during the term of the cap no payment is made to us  we also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 425 million and receive threemonth libor three of these swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million became effective in march 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 191 the three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of 100 million 25 million and 75 million became effective in december 2011 and have fixed rates of 250 196 and 132 and maturity dates in december 2014 december 2013 and december 2012 respectively  during the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of 1 billion whereby we paid a premium of 240000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 225 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 225 during the term of the caps all of these caps expired in december 2011 the threemonth libor rate never rose above 225 during the term of the caps therefore no payments were made to us we also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount    88    table of contents  of 600 million and receive threemonth libor each of the four swaps became effective in december 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 238  during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of 150 million and receive threemonth libor each of the two interest rate swaps had an initial notional principal amount of 75 million the notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to 50 million in october 2010the fixed rate payable was 476 and it matured in october 2012 the fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 487 and it matured in october 2011  we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 41 million at december 31 2012 substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet at december 31 2011 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 48 million of which 4 million is included in other current liabilities and 44 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet  the table below presents information about our longterm financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2012 for
