discontinued operations as discussed herein    41    table of contents   item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview  our principal business is owning and operating through our subsidiaries acute care hospitals behavioral health centers surgical hospitals ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers as of february 28 2013 we owned andor operated 23 acute care hospitals and 197 behavioral health centers located in 37 states washington dc puerto rico and the us virgin islands as part of our ambulatory treatment centers division we manage andor own outright or in partnerships with physicians 5 surgical hospitals and surgery and radiation oncology centers located in 4 states  in october 2012 we acquired ascend health corporation ascend ascend was the largest private behavioral health provider with 9 owned or leased freestanding inpatient facilities located in 5 states  during the first quarter of 2012 we adopted the financial accounting standards boards accounting standards update asu no 201107 health care entities topic 954 presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue provision for bad debts and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities which required certain health care entities to change the presentation in their statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts as a result the provision for doubtful accounts for our acute care and behavioral health care facilities is reflected as a deduction from net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2012 2011 and 2010 the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position or overall results of operations  net revenues from our acute care hospitals surgical hospitals surgery centers and radiation oncology centers accounted for 50 of our consolidated net revenues in 2012 51 in 2011 and 67 in 2010 net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities accounted for 50 of our consolidated net revenues during 2012 49 during 2011 and 33 during 2010  services provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery internal medicine obstetrics emergency room care radiology oncology diagnostic care coronary care pediatric services pharmacy services andor behavioral health services we provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities including central purchasing information services finance and control systems facilities planning physician recruitment services administrative personnel management marketing and public

believes estimates appears projects and similar expressions as well as statements in future tense identify forwardlooking statements  forwardlooking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at or by which such performance or results will be achieved forwardlooking information is based on information available at the time andor our good faith belief with    42    table of contents  respect to future events and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements such factors include among other things the following            our ability to comply with the existing laws and government regulations andor changes in laws and government regulations            an increasing number of legislative initiatives have recently been passed into law that may result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level no assurances can be given that the implementation of these new laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations            possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payors or government programs including medicare or medicaid            an increase in the number of uninsured and selfpay patients treated at our acute care facilities that unfavorably impacts our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our selfpay patient accounts            our ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same including contracts with unitedsierra healthcare in las vegas nevada            the outcome of known and unknown litigation government investigations false claim act allegations and liabilities and other claims asserted against us including matters as disclosed in item 3 legal proceedings            the potential unfavorable impact on our business of deterioration in national regional and local economic and business conditions including a continuation or worsening of unfavorable credit market conditions            competition from other healthcare providers including physician owned facilities in certain markets including mcallenedinburg texas the site of one of our largest acute care facilities and riverside county california            technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing or reduce the demand for healthcare            our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals            demographic changes            our level of indebtedness has increased substantially as a result of our 2010 acquisition of psi and increased more as a result of our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october 2012 as discussed herein which could among other things adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could potentially prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements related to our indebtedness            our ability to successfully integrate and improve our recent acquisitions and the availability of suitable acquisitions and divestiture opportunities            as discussed below in sources of revenue we receive revenues from various state and county based programs including medicaid in all the states in which we operate we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc virginia illinois and massachusetts cmsapproved medicaid supplemental programs in certain states including texas oklahoma arkansas indiana and ohio and state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including texas and south carolina we are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective states 2012 and 2013 fiscal years as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states we can    43    table of contents       provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations            our ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms including borrowed funds to fund the future growth of our business            some of our acute care facilities continue to experience decreasing inpatient admission trends            our financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payors and there can be no assurance that failure of the payors to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations            the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations in july 2010 implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria certain of our acute care hospitals implemented ehr applications in 2011 and 2012 and we plan to continue the implementation at each of our acute care hospitals on a facilitybyfacility basis until completion which is expected to occur in mid2013 however there can be no assurance that we our acute care hospitals will ultimately qualify for these incentive payments and should we qualify we are unable to quantify the amount of incentive payments we may receive since the amounts are dependent upon various factors including the implementation timing at each hospital should we qualify for incentive payments there may be timing differences in the recognition of the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of the ehr application which may cause material periodtoperiod changes in our future results of operations hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by 2015 there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act            in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law the 2011 act imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction the joint committee which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented which if triggered would result in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 39 million annual reduction to our medicare net revenues with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs starting in 2013 we cannot predict whether congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress            as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 our accounts receivable includes approximately 70 million and 54 million respectively due from illinois collection of these receivables continues to be delayed due to state budgetary and funding pressures approximately 51 million as of december 31 2012 and 41 million as of december 31 2011 of the receivables due from illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days as of each respective date and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future since we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to    44    table of contents       us no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows            the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance on current terms            changes in our business strategies or development plans            fluctuations in the value of our common stock and            other factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission  given these uncertainties risks and assumptions as outlined above you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made we assume no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statements to reflect actual results changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forwardlooking information except as may be required by law all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement  critical accounting policies and estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note 1 to the financial statements we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements including the following  revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided medicare and medicaid revenues represented 39 of our net patient revenues during 2012 41 during 2011 and 42 during 2010 revenues from managed care entities including health maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for 49 of our net patient revenues during 2012 47 during 2011 and 51 during 2010  we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and thirdparty payors and others for services rendered we have agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge reimbursed costs discounted charges and per diem payments estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws rules and regulations and contract terms to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available however due to the complexities involved in these estimations actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record  we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information patient utilization data government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of    45    table of contents  administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements such amounts are included in accounts receivable net on our consolidated balance sheets the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes as such we cannot provide any assurance that future legislation and regulations if enacted will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our results in 2012 2011 or 2010 if it were to occur each 1 adjustment to our estimated net medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december 31 2012 would change our aftertax net income by approximately 1 million  we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable net see additional disclosure below in charity care and uninsured discounts in acute care hospital services for our estimated uncompensated care provided and estimated cost of providing uncompensated care   a portion of the accounts receivable at our acute care facilities are comprised of medicaid accounts that are pending approval from thirdparty payers but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payers such as county indigent programs in certain states our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patients responsible party at the time of registration at that time an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned there are various preestablished insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration based upon a screening evaluation if we are unable to definitively determine if they are currently medicaid eligible when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending our patient accounting system records net revenues for the services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patients medicaid eligibility based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts our acute care facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending as well as other accounts receivable payer classifications are considered when the overall individual facility and companywide reserves are developed adjustments related to the final determination of these accounts did not materially impact our results of operations in 2012 2011 or 2010  provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from thirdparty payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patients responsibility primarily copayments and deductibles we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payer mix the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted at our acute care hospitals third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is finalized or accounts for uninsured patients the patient receives statements and collection letters patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for potential sources of financial assistance including our charity care policy if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay the account is writtenoff as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort  uninsured patients that do not qualify as charity patients are extended an uninsured discount of a minimum of 30 of total charges our hospitals establish a partial reserve for selfpay accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts for both unbilled balances and those that have been billed and are under 90 days old all selfpay accounts are fully reserved at 90 days from the date of discharge third party liability accounts are fully    46    table of contents  reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past 180 days from the date of discharge potential charity accounts are fully reserved when it is determined the patient may be unable to pay  as of december 31 2012 our accounts receivable includes 70 million due from illinois 54 million as of december 31 2011 the collection of which has been delayed due to budgetary and funding pressures experienced by the state although as of december 31 2012 approximately 51 million of the receivables due from illinois have been outstanding in excess of 60 days 41 million as of december 31 2011 and a large portion will likely remain outstanding for the foreseeable future we expect to eventually collect all amounts due to us and therefore no related reserves have been established in our consolidated financial statements however we can provide no assurance that we will eventually collect all amounts due to us from illinois failure to ultimately collect all outstanding amounts due from illinois would have an adverse impact on our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows  on a consolidated basis we monitor our total selfpay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience our accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 311 million and 253 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively

         accounting for medicare and medicaid electronic health records incentive payments in july 2010 the department of health and human services published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act the regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and established the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of    47    table of contents  certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available  medicare ehr incentive payments federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  medicaid ehr incentive payments medicaid ehr incentive payments are determined based upon prior period cost report information available at the time our hospitals meet the meaningful use criteria therefore the majority of the medicaid ehr incentive income recognition occurs in the period in which the applicable hospitals are deemed to have met initial meaningful use criteria upon meeting subsequent fiscal year meaningful use criteria our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid ehr incentive payments which will be recognized as incentive income in future periods medicaid ehr incentive payments received prior to our hospitals meeting the meaningful use criteria are included in other current liabilities as deferred ehr incentive income in our consolidated balance sheet  selfinsured risks we provide for selfinsured risks primarily general and professional liability claims and workers compensation claims our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies all relevant information including our own historical experience is used in estimating the expected amount of claims while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate our estimated selfinsured reserves are reviewed and changed if necessary at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  professional and general liability and workers compensation liability  effective january 1 2008 most of our subsidiaries became selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per occurrence prior to our acquisition of psychiatric solutions inc psi in november 2010 our subsidiaries purchased several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of 10 million up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate however we are liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  prior to our acquisition in november 2010 the psi subsidiaries were commercially insured for professional and general liability insurance claims in excess of a 3 million selfinsured retention to a limit of 75 million psi utilized its captive insurance company and that captive insurance company remains in place after our acquisition of psi to manage the selfinsured retention for all former psi subsidiaries for claims incurred prior to january 1 2011 the captive insurance company also continues to insure all professional and general liability claims regardless of date incurred for the former psi subsidiaries located in florida and puerto rico  since our acquisition of psi on november 15 2010 the former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 3 million per occurrence and our legacy subsidiaries which are not former psi subsidiaries are selfinsured for professional and general liability exposure up to 10 million per    48    table of contents  occurrence effective november 2010 our subsidiaries including the former psi subsidiaries were provided with several excess policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for coverage in excess of the applicable per occurrence selfinsured retention either 3 million or 10 million up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate we remain liable for 10 of the claims paid pursuant to the commercially insured coverage in excess of 10 million up to 60 million per occurrence and in the aggregate the 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from ascend health corporation in october 2012 have general and professional liability policies through commercial insurance carriers which provide for up to 20 million of aggregate coverage subject to a 10000 per occurrence deductible these facilities like our other facilities are also provided excess coverage through commercial insurance carriers for coverage in excess of the underlying commercial policy limitations up to 200 million per occurrence and in the aggregate  our estimated liability for selfinsured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including among other things the number of asserted claims and reported incidents estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies while we continuously monitor these factors our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate given our significant selfinsured exposure for professional and general liability claims there can be no assurance that a sharp increase in the number andor severity of claims asserted against us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from psi was 279 million of which 48 million is included in current liabilities as of december 31 2011 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims including the estimated claims related to the facilities acquired from psi was 292 million of which 60 million is included in current liabilities  we recorded reductions to our professional and general liability selfinsurance reserves relating to prior years amounting to 27 million during 2012 11 million during 2011 and 49 million during 2010 the favorable change recorded during 2012 resulted from favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments pursuant to a reserve analysis the favorable change recorded during 2011 consisted primarily of thirdparty recoveries and reserve reductions in connection with phicorelated claims which we became liable for upon phicos a former commercial insurance carrier liquidation in 2002 the favorable changes in our estimated future claims payments recorded during 2010 were due to i an increased weighting given to companyspecific metrics to 75 from 50 and decreased general industry metrics to 25 from 50 related to projected incidents per exposure historical claims experience and loss development factors ii historical data which measured the realized favorable impact of medical malpractice tort reform experienced in several states in which we operate and iii a decrease in claims related to certain higher risk specialties such as obstetrical due to a continuation of the companywide patient safety initiative undertaken during the last several years as the number of our facilities and our patient volumes have increased thereby providing for a statistically significant data group and taking into consideration our longhistory of companyspecific risk management programs and claims experience our reserve analyses have included a greater emphasis on our historical professional and general liability experience which has developed favorably as compared to general industry trends  there were no material adjustments to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims recorded during 2012 or 2011 based upon the results of workers compensation reserves analyses during 2010 we recorded a reduction to our prior year reserves for workers compensation claims amounting to 4 million  although we are unable to predict whether or not our future financial statements will include adjustments to our prior year reserves for selfinsured general and professional and workers compensation claims given the relatively unpredictable nature of the these potential liabilities and the factors impacting these reserves as discussed above it is reasonably likely that our future financial results may include material adjustments to prior period reserves    49    table of contents below is a schedule showing the changes in our general and

we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses including windstorm damage up to a 1 billion policy limit per occurrence subject to a 250000 deductible for the majority of our properties the properties acquired from psychiatric solutions inc are subject to a 50000 deductible losses resulting from named windstorms are subject to deductibles between 3 and 5 of the declared total insurable value of the property in addition we have commercial property insurance policies covering catastrophic losses resulting from earthquake and flood damage each subject to aggregated loss limits as opposed to per occurrence losses our earthquake limit is 250 million subject to a deductible of 250000 except for facilities located within documented fault zones earthquake losses that affect facilities located in fault zones within the united states are subject to a 100 million limit and will have applied deductibles ranging from 1 to 5 of the declared total insurable value of the property the earthquake limit in puerto rico is 25 million flood losses have either a 250000 or 500000 deductible based upon the location of the facility the 9 behavioral health facilities acquired from ascend health corporation in october 2012 have commercial property insurance policies which provide for full replacement cost coverage subject to a 10000 deductible  due to an increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years the cost of commercial property insurance has increased as a result catastrophic coverage for earthquake and flood has been limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses given these insurance market conditions there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations    50    table of contents longlived assets we review our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates  goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit we have designated september 1st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september 1 2012 which indicated no impairment of goodwill future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review including profitability and market value projections could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a writeoff of a portion or all of our goodwill  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of

managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients  hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg medicalsurgical intensive care or behavioral health and the    63    table of contents  geographic location of the hospital inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons many of which are beyond our control the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis as well as increased pressure from medicare medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services where possible on a less expensive outpatient basis we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues  patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare medicaid some private insurance plans and managed care plans but are responsible for services not covered by such plans exclusions deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage the amount of such exclusions deductibles and coinsurance has generally been increasing each year indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payors and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and selfpay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided  since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from facilities located in nevada texas and california we are particularly sensitive to regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in those states any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results  the following tables show the approximate percentages of net patient revenue during the

aged 65 and over some disabled persons and persons with endstage renal disease all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the medicare program our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program  under the medicare program for inpatient services our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps under the ipps hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge the fixed payment amount is based upon each patients medicare severity diagnosis related group msdrg every msdrg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis the msdrg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care this msdrg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each msdrg the msdrg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity while we generally will not receive payment from medicare for inpatient services other than the msdrg payment a hospital may qualify for an outlier payment if a particular patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold  msdrg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year which begins on october 1 the index used to adjust the msdrg rates known as the hospital market basket index gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services generally however the percentage increases in the msdrg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  in july 2010 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published its final ipps 2011 payment rule which provided for a 26 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors and annual geographic wage index updates and the documenting and coding adjustments were considered our overall decrease from the federal fiscal year 2011 rule was 11 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 025 in federal fiscal year 2011  in august 2011 cms published its final ipps 2012 payment rule which provided for a 30 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform productivity adjustments are considered we estimate that our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2012 rule was

budget neutrality adjustment in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform    65    table of contents  discussion below cms was also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 010 in federal fiscal year 2012 the projected impact from this ipps rule noted above reflects all of the adjustments described in this paragraph  in august 2012 cms published its final ipps 2013 payment rule which provided for a 26 market basket increase to the base medicare msdrg blended rate when statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors annual geographic wage index updates documenting and coding adjustments and health care reform mandated adjustments are considered we estimate our overall increase from the final federal fiscal year 2013 rule covering the period

impact of potential reductions related to the budget control act of 2011 as discussed below  in september 2007 the tma abstinence education and qi programs extension act of 2007 legislation took effect and scaled back cuts in hospital reimbursement that cms was set to impose in federal fiscal years 2010 to 2012 the new law required cms to make adjustments to the medicare standardized amounts in these years to reflect the removal of actual aggregate payment increases or decreases for documentation and coding adjustments that occurred during federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 as compared to the initial cms estimates in federal fiscal year 2010 cms made its initial statutory mandated adjustment under this legislation and continued to do so in subsequent fiscal years to ensure the implementation of msdrgs was budget neutral among all affected hospitals  on january 1 2005 cms implemented a new psychiatric prospective payment system psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program this system replaced the costbased reimbursement guidelines with a per diem psych pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics the psych pps also contained provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospitals base payment if it maintains a fullservice emergency department according to the april 2010 cms notice the market basket increase was 24 for the period of july 1 2010 through june 30 2011 in april 2011 cms published its final psych pps rule for the fifteen month period july 1 2011 to september 30 2012 the market basket increase for this time period is 295 which includes a 025 reduction required by the federal health care reform legislation enacted in 2010 in august 2012 cms published the federal year 2013 psych pps rate notice the market basket increase for this period is 27 less required health care reform legislation reductions totaling 08 for a net market basket increase of 19  in november 2010 cms published its annual final medicare outpatient prospective payment system opps rule for 2011 the final market basket increase to the opps base rate is 246 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 025 in federal fiscal year 2011 when other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered the overall medicare opps payment increase for 2011 was approximately 32  in november 2011 cms published its annual final medicare opps rule for 2012 the market basket increase to the opps base rate is 30 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms is also required by federal law to reduce the update factor by 01 in federal fiscal year 2012 and to reduce the annual update by a productivity adjustment which is 11 in the final rule cms is also implementing a significant decrease in the 2012 medicare rates for both hospitalbased and community mental health center partial hospitalization programs when other statutorily required adjustments hospital patient service mix and the aforementioned partial hospitalization rates are considered our overall medicare opps payment decrease for 2012 was estimated to be approximately 07 excluding the behavioral health division partial hospitalization rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2012 was approximately 21    66    table of contents in november 2012 cms published its annual final medicare opps rule for 2013 the market basket increase to the opps base rate is 26 in addition as outlined in the sources of revenues and health care reform discussion below cms is also required by federal law to

rate impact our medicare opps payment increase for 2013 is estimated to be 17  in august 2011 the budget control act of 2011 the 2011 act was enacted into law included in this law are the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by 917 billion between 2012 and 2021 according to a report released by the congressional budget office among its other provisions the law established a bipartisan congressional committee known as the joint committee which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional 15 trillion over 10 years the joint committee was unable to reach an agreement by the november 23 2011 deadline and as a result acrosstheboard cuts to discretionary national defense and medicare spending were implemented which if triggered would result in medicare payment reductions of up to 2 per fiscal year approximately 39 million reduction to our annual medicare net revenues with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs starting in 2013  on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act atra of 2012 was enacted and included provisions that resulted in the postponement of the aforementioned acrosstheboard 2 medicare payment reductions until at least april 2013 we cannot predict whether congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic medicare budget cuts or what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress the atra of 2012 also includes a requirement for cms to recoup 11 billion from hospitals from medicare ipps rates during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2017 the recoupment relates to ipps documentation and coding adjustments for the period 2008 to 2013 for which adjustments were not previously applied by cms the 2014 ipps proposed rule is scheduled to be published by cms in may 2013 which will contain the proposed ipps reduction percentage for ffy2014 in january 2013 the medicare payment advisory commission medpac indicated that if cms were to ratably recoup the atra of 2012 mandated documentation and coding recoupment from ffys 2014 to 2017 a 24 reduction would be required in each of these federal fiscal years if implemented in ffys 2014 to 2017 a 24 ipps reduction would reduce our expected medicare payment ipps payment update amount by approximately 18 million annually commencing in october 2013  we entered into an agreement in april 2012 with the united states department of health and human services the secretary of health and human services and cms referred to collectively as hhs that resulted in an aggregate cash payment to us of approximately 36 million which was received during 2012 after reductions for estimated related expenses and the portion attributable to thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests this settlement favorably impacted our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results by approximately 30 million recording during the first quarter of 2012 this agreement was part of an industrywide settlement with hhs related to litigation that was pending for several years contending that acute care hospitals in the us were underpaid from the medicare inpatient prospective payment system during a number of prior years the underpayments resulted from calculations related to rural floor budget neutrality adjustments that were implemented in connection with the balanced budget act of 1997  during march 2012 cms issued new supplemental security income ssi ratios utilized for calculating medicare disproportionate share hospital reimbursements medicare dsh for federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009 as a result of these new ssi ratios acute care hospitals are required to recalculate their medicare dsh for the affected years and record adjustments for differences in estimated reimbursements in addition two of our acute care hospitals located in florida were notified that the respective counties in which they operate were no longer funding the hospitals with certain reimbursements resulting from reductions in federal matching    67    table of contents  intergovernmental transfer funds as a result of the unfavorable adjustments required from the revised ssi ratios and the writeoff of receivables from certain counties located in florida our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results were unfavorably impacted by an aggregate of approximately 8 million recorded during the first quarter of 2012 net of the portion attributable to thirdparty noncontrolling ownership interests  medicaid medicaid is a joint federalstate funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care most state medicaid payments are made under a ppslike system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for services provided in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities  we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc virginia illinois and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states in the states in which we operate based upon the state budgets for the 2012 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2011 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates have been reduced by approximately 3 to 4 or approximately 45 million to 55 million annually from the average rates in effect during the states 2011 fiscal years which generally ended during the third quarter of 2011 our consolidated results of operations during 2012 and 2011 include the pro rata portion of these medicaid rate reductions based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates will be reduced by approximately 1 or approximately 15 million annually from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012 we can provide no assurance that further reductions to medicaid revenues particularly in the abovementioned states will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  certain of our acute care hospitals located in various counties of texas hidalgo maverick potter and webb participate in cmsapproved private medicaid supplemental payment upl programs these hospitals also have affiliation agreements with thirdparty hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties our hospitals receive both upl payments from the medicaid program and indigent care payments from thirdparty affiliated hospitals the upl payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an intergovernmental transfer igt to the state medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals we recorded net upl and affiliated hospital indigent care revenues of 25 million during 2012 31 million during 2011 and 38 million during 2010 if the applicable hospital district or county makes igts consistent with 2012 levels and without giving effect to potential reductions resulting from the february 2013 thhsc proposed rule or the potential additional medicaid upl revenues related to an affiliation agreement with a government entity both of which are discussed below we believe we would be entitled to aggregate net revenues earned pursuant to these programs of approximately 25 million during the state fiscal year state 2013 which ends on september 30 2013  for state fiscal year 2013 texas medicaid will continue to operate under a cmsapproved section 1115 fiveyear medicaid waiver demonstration program during the first five years of this program that started in state fiscal year 2012 the texas health and human services commission thhsc transitioned away from upl payments to new waiver incentive payment programs during the first year of transition which commenced on october 1 2011 thhsc made payments to medicaid upl recipient providers that received payments during the states prior fiscal year during transition years two through five thhsc will make incentive payments under the program after certain qualifying criteria are met by hospitals upl payments are also subject to an aggregate    68    table of contents  statewide caps based on cms approved medicaid waiver amounts in february 2013 thhsc proposed a rule that indicates that any required statewide upl payment reductions will be applied a pro rata basis to all upl payment recipients although our future upl payments in texas may be adversely impacted by this proposed rule we are unable to estimate the potential impact on us since the amount of the statewide pro rata upl payment reduction if any has not yet been determined by thhsc beginning in 2013 we may be entitled to additional medicaid upl payments pursuant to an indigent care affiliation agreement entered into between a government entity and one of our acute care hospitals located in texas consistent with other medicaid upl programs in texas these potential additional medicaid upl payments will be contingent on voluntary igts made by the government entity  we incur healthcare related taxes provider taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to i healthcare items or services ii the provision of or the authority to provide the health care items of services or iii the payment for the health care items or services such provider taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching dollars as part of their respective state medicaid programs we derive a related medicaid reimbursement benefit from assessed provider taxes in the form of medicaid claims based payment increases andor lump sum medicaid supplemental payments including the impact of the oklahoma indiana and ohio programs that were initiated during 2012 as mentioned below we earned an aggregate net benefit of approximately 57 million during 2012 of which 12 million related to 2011 and 26 million during 2011 from medicaid supplemental payments after assessed provider taxes were considered we estimate that our aggregate net benefit from provider tax programs will approximate 48 million during 2013 the aggregate net benefit is earned from multiple states and therefore no particular states portion is individually material to our consolidated financial statements however provider taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that if reduced from current rates in several states could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated future results of operations  in january 2012 the state of oklahoma was granted federal approval by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for the supplemental hospital offset payment program shopp which grants the oklahoma health care authority the authority to assess a 25 fee on certain oklahoma hospitals and to make medicaid supplemental payments to hospitals through december 31 2014 retroactive to july 1 2011 the state finalized the initial supplemental payment program amounts in march 2012 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the shopp program during the states fiscal years of 2012 and 2013 we estimate that we are entitled to annual net reimbursements of approximately 14 million retroactive to july 1 2011 our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately 21 million in connection with the shopp program covering the period of july 1 2011 through december 31 2012  during the second quarter of 2012 new supplemental medicaid programs were initiated in indiana and ohio in which we operate behavioral health care facilities our 2012 pretax consolidated financial results were favorably impacted by approximately 14 million recorded in connection with these programs which were retroactive to july 2011  in california a medicaid state plan amendment spa was submitted to cms by the state requesting and extension of a prior provider tax and related medicaid supplemental payment program retroactive to july 1 2011 through december 31 2013 in june 2012 cms approved a portion of the spa which did not have a material impact on our 2012 consolidated financial statements approval of the additional spa component related to medicaid managed care supplemental payments would have a favorable impact on our future results of operations  state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of lowincome patients ie those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding 25 are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment congress established a national limit on dsh    69    table of contents  adjustments although this legislation and the resulting state broadbased provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program to date the net impact has not been materially adverse  upon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolinas low income patients five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each states dsh fund the south carolina and texas dsh programs were renewed for each states 2013 dsh fiscal year covering the period of october 1 2012 through september 30 2013 in february 2013 the thhsc published a proposed rule that included amounts that are expected to be similar to the 2012 fiscal year program amounts assuming the texas dsh program is funded by the public hospitals for the states 2013 dsh fiscal year in connection with these dsh programs included in our financial results was an aggregate of 47 million during 2012 45 million during 2011 and 54 million during 2010 assuming that the texas and south carolina programs are renewed for each states 2014 fiscal years at amounts similar to the 2013 fiscal year estimates we estimate our aggregate reimbursements pursuant to these programs to be approximately 44 million during 2013 failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary igts for the states share of the dsh programs failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs or reductions in reimbursements could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  hitech act in july 2010 the department of health and human services hhs published final regulations implementing the health information technology hit provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act referred to as the hitech act the final regulation defines the meaningful use of electronic health records ehr and establishes the requirements for the medicare and medicaid ehr payment incentive programs the final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria the implementation period for these new medicare and medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for medicare and 2021 for the state medicaid programs state medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but we expect that all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate will ultimately choose to participate our acute care hospitals may qualify for these ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria the governments ultimate goal is to promote more effective quality and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system  during 2011 we began implementing ehr applications at certain of our acute care hospitals and will continue to do so on a hospitalbyhospital basis until completion which is scheduled to occur by the end of june 2013 as of december 31 2012 ehr applications have been implemented at fourteen of our acute care hospitals our acute care hospitals will be eligible for medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments upon implementation of the ehr application assuming they meet the meaningful use criteria as of december 31 2012 eleven hospitals met the meaningful use criteria  our 2012 consolidated results of operations includes a favorable pretax impact of approximately 3 million consisting of approximately 30 million of ehr incentive income consisting of 18 million of medicare incentive income and 12 million of medicaid incentive income less approximately 15 million of salaries wages benefits and other operating expenses approximately 13 million of depreciation and amortization expense plus approximately 1 million of net expense attributable to noncontrolling interests  as of december 31 2012 we received an aggregate of approximately 37 million of medicare 14 million and medicaid 23 million ehr incentive payments these payments which arewere reflected as deferred ehr incentive income on our consolidated balance sheet included in other current liabilities will bewere recorded as ehr incentive income in our consolidated statements of income in the applicable periods pursuant to our ehr incentive income accounting policies as disclosed above upon meeting the meaningful use criteria our hospitals may become entitled to additional medicaid incentive payments in future periods    70    table of contents we previously classified approximately 2 million of ehr incentive income as net revenues in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended june 30 2012 that amount has been reclassified and is now included in the line item ehr incentive income in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2012  federal regulations require that medicare ehr incentive payments be computed based on the medicare cost report that begins in the federal fiscal period in which a hospital meets the applicable meaningful use requirements since the annual medicare cost report periods for each of our acute care hospitals ends on december 31st  we will recognize medicare ehr incentive income for each hospital during the fourth quarter of the year in which the facility meets the meaningful use criteria and during the fourth quarter of each applicable subsequent year  hospitals that do not qualify as a meaningful user of ehr by 2015 are subject to a reduced market basket update to the ipps standardized amount in 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year although we believe that our acute care hospitals will be in compliance with the ehr standards by 2015 there can be no assurance that all of our facilities will be in compliance and therefore not subject to the penalty provision of the hitech act  managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies which include health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and managed medicare referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage and medicaid programs in general we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate typically we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers however during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies  commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policy holders based upon the particular hospitals established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor  commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms including predetermined payment or drgbased payment systems for more inpatient and outpatient services to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals  other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage such patients are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs as well as our local hospitals indigent and charity care policy patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care writeoffs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances  medicaid emergency psychiatric demonstration the affordable care act established the medicaid emergency psychiatric demonstration project act which created a threeyear 75 million demonstration program to allow coverage for adults in freestanding psychiatric facilities this proposal allows states to remove the medicaid institution for mental disease imd exclusion for medicaid patients between the ages of 2164 who are receiving care in freestanding nongovernmental psychiatric hospitals to stabilize their emergency psychiatric condition    71    table of contents sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of among other things the war on terrorism economic recovery stimulus packages responses to natural disasters the expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations  in march 2010 the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 hr 4872 pl 111152 the reconciliation act and the patient protection and affordable care act pl 111148 the affordable care act were enacted into law and created significant changes to health insurance coverage for us citizens as well as material revisions to the federal medicare and state medicaid programs medicare medicaid and other health care industry changes which are scheduled to be implemented at various times during this decade are noted below  immediate medicare reductions  the reconciliation act reduced the market basket update for inpatient and outpatient hospitals and inpatient behavioral health facilities by 025 in each of 2010 and 2011 and by 010 in 2012 further the affordable care act implements certain reforms to medicare advantage payments effective in 2011  future medicare reductions  future changes to the medicare program include            a medicare shared savings program effective 2012            a hospital readmissions reduction program effective 2012            a national pilot program on payment bundling effective 2013            a valuebased purchasing program for hospitals effective 2012            reduction to medicare disproportionate share hospital dsh payments effective 2014  during 2012 we recorded 107 million in medicare dsh payments from the medicare traditional fee for service ffs program we expect that cms will publish a proposed rule during the second quarter of 2013 that implements the abovementioned reduction to medicare dsh payments pursuant to the affordable care act although we are not yet able to quantify the ultimate impact of these reductions on our future results of operations based on our preliminary internal projections we estimate that this provision could reduce our annual medicare ffs dsh payments by 40 to 50 starting october 1 2013  medicaid revisions            expanded medicaid eligibility and related special federal payments effective 2014            reduction to medicaid dsh effective 2014  health insurance revisions            large employer insurance reforms effective 2014            individual insurance mandate and related federal subsidies effective 2014            federally mandated insurance coverage reforms 2010 and forward  although the abovementioned medicare market basket reductions implemented in 2010 did not have a material impact on our results of operations to date we are unable to estimate the future impact of the other legislative changes as outlined above    72    table of contents valuebased purchasing  there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward valuebased purchasing of healthcare services these valuebased purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates in addition medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events  the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote valuebased purchasing the affordable care act prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions hac beginning in ffy 2015 hospitals that fall into the top 25 of national riskadjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1 reduction in their total medicare payments hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard  the affordable care act also required hhs to implement a valuebased purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on october 1 2012 the affordable care act requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1 in ffy 2013 and increasing by 025 each fiscal year up to 2 in ffy 2017 and subsequent years hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions  accountable care organizations  the affordable care act requires hhs to establish a medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations acos the aco program allows providers including hospitals physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services the program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency acos that achieve quality performance standards established by hhs will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the medicare program  in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations postpayment audits requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years because of audits by the program representatives providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments nevertheless until final adjustments are made certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required  finally we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations  other operating results  combined revenues from our surgical hospitals ambulatory

seasonality  seasonalityour acute care services business is typically seasonal with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year this seasonality occurs because generally more people become ill during the winter months which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months  inflationinflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years however since the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply and other costs we cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our ability to contain future expense increases our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal state and local laws which have been enacted that in certain cases limit our ability to increase prices we believe however that through adherence to cost containment policies labor management and reasonable price increases the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable    77    table of contents liquidity  year ended december 31 2012 as compared to december 31 2011  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash provided by

800 million revolving credit facility net of 164 million of outstanding borrowings including borrowings outstanding pursuant to a shortterm ondemand credit facility and 62 million of outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2012 we had 14 million of outstanding borrowings under a shortterm ondemand credit facility outstanding borrowings pursuant to this facility are classified as longterm on our consolidated balance sheet since we have the intent and ability to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our credit agreement  quarterly installment payments installment payments are due on the term loana and term loana2 facilities which are equal to approximately 72 million in 2013 72 million in 2014 77 million in 2015 and 46 million in 2016 no

facilities in 2011 we made scheduled principal payments of 16 million on the term loanb facility and 26 million on the term loana facility the installment payments due in 2013 on the term loana and term loana2 facilities are classified as longterm on our consolidated balance sheet since we expect to have the borrowing capacity and would intend to refinance through available borrowings under the terms of our credit agreement our accounts receivable securitization program securitization with a group of conduit lenders and liquidity banks was amended in october 2010 we increased the size of the securitization from 200 million to 240 million the commitments and extended the maturity date to october 25 2013 in may 2012 we further increased the size of the securitization by 35 million to 275 million substantially all of the patientrelated accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals receivables serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings the interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0475 and there is a facility fee of 0375 required on 102 on the commitments we have accounted for this securitization as borrowings we maintain effective control over the receivables since pursuant to the terms of the securitization the receivables are sold from certain of our subsidiaries to special purpose entities that are whollyowned by us the receivables however are owned by the special purpose entities can be used only to satisfy the debts of the whollyowned special purpose entities and thus are not available to us except through our ownership interest in the special purpose entities the whollyowned special purpose entities use the receivables to collateralize the loans obtained from the group of thirdparty conduit lenders and liquidity banks the group of thirdparty conduit lenders and liquidity banks do not have recourse to us beyond the assets of the whollyowned special purpose entities that securitize the loans at december 31 2012 we had 249 million of outstanding borrowings and 26 million of additional capacity pursuant to the terms of our accounts receivable securitization program in the event we do not either enter into a new financing agreement or an agreement to extend the scheduled maturity date of the securitization we expect to have the borrowing capacity and would intend to refinance the securitization upon its scheduled maturity utilizing borrowings under our credit agreement therefore outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2012 under the securitization are classified as longterm

repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds additional funds may be obtained through i the issuance of equity ii borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility or through refinancing the existing revolving credit agreement andor iii the issuance of other longterm debt we believe that our operating cash flows cash and cash equivalents available borrowing capacity under our 800 million revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our    85    table of contents  operating investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months however in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we

options    e consists of 208 million of estimated future payments related to our noncontributory defined benefit pension plan estimated through 2087 as disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and 17 million of estimated future payments related to another retirement plan liability included in our other noncurrent liabilities as of december 31 2012 was a 10 million liability recorded in connection with the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and a 13 million liability recorded in connection with the other retirement plan  as of december 31 2012 the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was 279 million of which 48 million is included in other current liabilities and 231 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities we exclude the 279 million for professional and general liability claims from the contractual obligations table because there are no significant contractual obligations associated with these liabilities and because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments please see selfinsured risks above for additional disclosure related to our professional and general liability claims and reserves  in connection with five acute care facilities located in las vegas nevada the minority ownership interests of which are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet the outside owners have certain put rights that are currently exercisable that if exercised require us to purchase the minority members interests at fair market value the put rights are exercisable upon the occurrence of i certain specified financial conditions falling below established thresholds ii breach of the management contract by the managing member a subsidiary of ours or iii if the minority members ownership percentage is reduced to less than certain thresholds in connection with a behavioral health care facility located in philadelphia pennsylvania and acquired by us as part of the psi acquisition the minority ownership interest of which is also reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet the outside owner has a put option to put its entire ownership interest to us at any time if exercised the put option requires us to purchase the minority members interest at fair market value as of december 31 2012 we believe the fair market value of the minority ownership interests in these facilities pursuant to the terms of the put options approximates the 234 million aggregate book value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests we exclude the approximate amount that we may be required to pay to repurchase these minority ownership interests from the contractual obligations table because of the uncertainty as to i whether or not the put rights will actually be exercised ii the dollar amounts that would be paid if the put rights were exercised and iii the timing of such payments  additionally the table above does not include 7 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2012 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for which the amounts may be utilized      item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we manage our ratio of fixed and floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate to manage this risk in a costeffective manner we from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we agree to exchange various combinations of fixed andor variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts we account for our derivative and hedging activities using the financial accounting standard boards fasb guidance which requires all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet for derivative transactions designated as hedges we formally document all relationships between the hedging instrument and the related hedged item as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction    87    table of contents derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci within shareholders equity amounts are reclassified from aoci to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged transaction affects earnings we use interest rate derivatives in our cash flow hedge transactions such derivatives are designed to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows related to the hedged liability for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges the ineffective portion of the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized currently in the income statement  for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the shortcut method at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future  the fair value of interest rate swap agreements approximates the amount at which they could be settled based on estimates obtained from the counterparties we assess the effectiveness of our hedge instruments on a quarterly basis we performed periodic assessments of the cash flow hedge instruments during 2012 and 2011 and determined the hedges to be highly effective we also determined that any portion of the hedges deemed to be ineffective was de minimis and therefore there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position operations or cash flows the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance however at december 31 2012 each swap agreement entered into by us was in a net liability position which would require us to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by our counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  during the first quarter of 2011 we entered into an interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 275 million whereby we paid a premium of 30000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 225 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 225 during the term of the cap which expired in december 2011 the threemonth libor never reached 225 during the term of the cap therefore no payment was made to us we also entered into a forward starting interest rate cap on a total notional amount of 450 million from december 2011 to december 2012 reducing to 400 million from december 2012 to december 2013 whereby we paid a premium of 740000 in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the difference between 700 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 700 during the term of the cap if the threemonth libor does not reach 700 during the term of the cap no payment is made to us  we also entered into six additional forward starting interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2011 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount of 425 million and receive threemonth libor three of these swaps with a total notional amount of 225 million became effective in march 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 191 the three remaining interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of 100 million 25 million and 75 million became effective in december 2011 and have fixed rates of 250 196 and 132 and maturity dates in december 2014 december 2013 and december 2012 respectively  during the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into three interest rate caps on a total notional amount of 1 billion whereby we paid a premium of 240000 in exchange for the counterparties agreeing to pay the difference between 225 and threemonth libor if the threemonth libor rate rises above 225 during the term of the caps all of these caps expired in december 2011 the threemonth libor rate never rose above 225 during the term of the caps therefore no payments were made to us we also entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2010 whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional amount    88    table of contents  of 600 million and receive threemonth libor each of the four swaps became effective in december 2011 and will mature in may 2015 the average fixed rate payable on these swaps is 238  during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into two interest rate swaps whereby we pay a fixed rate on a total notional principal amount of 150 million and receive threemonth libor each of the two interest rate swaps had an initial notional principal amount of 75 million the notional amount of the first interest rate swap reduced to 50 million in october 2010the fixed rate payable was 476 and it matured in october 2012 the fixed rate payable on the second interest rate swap was 487 and it matured in october 2011  we measure our interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis the fair value of our interest rate swaps is based primarily on quotes from banks we consider those inputs to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with derivative instruments and hedging activities the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 41 million at december 31 2012 substantially all of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet at december 31 2011 the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of 48 million of which 4 million is included in other current
