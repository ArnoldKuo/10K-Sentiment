 included herein for additional disclosure in addition currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services  we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices including ours although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions or that we will not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties in connection with the investigations even if we were to ultimately prevail the governments inquiry andor action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results  our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity it is also possible that our executives andor managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation andor named as defendants in private litigation  revenue rulings 9815 and 200451 in march 1998 and may 2004 the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between forprofit and notforprofit hospitals as a result of the tax rulings the irs has proposed and may in the future propose to revoke the taxexempt or public charity status of certain notforprofit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the taxexempt or public charity status of a notforprofit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with notforprofit hospitals andor require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with notforprofits  state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state in the aggregate state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results of operations  medical malpractice tort law reform medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level all states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits over half of the states have limits on    10    table of contents  damages awards almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits and many states have established limits on attorney fees many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform proposed solutions include enacting limits on noneconomic damages malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates reform legislation has also been proposed but not adopted at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area  compliance program our companywide compliance program has been in place since 1998 currently the programs elements include a code of conduct risk area specific policies and procedures employee education and training an internal system for reporting concerns auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies  since its initial adoption the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs specific written policies procedures training and educational materials and programs as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program claims preparation and submission including coding billing and cost reports comprise the bulk of these areas financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources including compliance with antikickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training standardized documentation requirements and review and audit  medical staff and employees  our facilities had approximately 66100 employees on december 31 2013 of whom approximately 47000 were employed fulltime our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals in a number of our markets physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours within our acute care division approximately 140 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time in addition within our behavioral health division approximately 380 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations each of our hospitals is managed on a daytoday basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours in addition a board of governors including members of the hospitals medical staff governs the medical professional and ethical practices at each hospital we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  approximately 1600 of our employees at five of our hospitals are unionized at valley hospital medical center unionized employees belong to the culinary workers and bartenders union the international union of operating engineers and the service employees international union seiu nurses and technicians at desert springs hospital are represented by the seiu and international union of operating engineers at the george washington university hospital unionized employees are represented by the seiu or the hospital police association registered nurses licensed practical nurses certain technicians and therapists pharmacy assistants and some clerical employees at hri hospital in boston are represented by the seiu at brooke glen behavioral hospital unionized employees are represented by the teamsters and the northwestern nurses associationpennsylvania association of staff nurses and allied professionals a union representation election was held at corona regional medical center corona in january of 2013 for the nursing staff a majority of those who cast ballots voted to be represented by the united nurses associations of californiaunion of health care professionals unacuhcp corona timely filed objections to the election and an appeal the results have not yet been certified the national labor relations board is currently reviewing the appeal    11    table of contents competition  the health care industry is highly competitive in recent years competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to among other things regulatory and technological changes increasing use of managed care payment systems cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals in addition some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sale and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us  in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical surgical and behavioral health services facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us  the number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff are important factors in determining a hospitals success and competitive advantage typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patients needs the quality of other physicians on the medical staff the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospitals facilities we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians  in addition we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues  many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws the application process for approval of additional covered services new facilities changes in operations and capital expenditures is therefore highly competitive in these states in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities competition in the form of new services facilities and capital spending is more prevalent see regulation and other factors  our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment in addition employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges in return hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients generally hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price market reputation geographic location quality and range of services quality of the medical staff and convenience the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations    12    table of contents a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets the competition to acquire hospitals is significant we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit health care companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms  relationship with universal health realty income trust  at december 31 2013 we held approximately 61 of the outstanding shares of universal health realty income trust the trust we serve as advisor to the trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the trusts daytoday affairs provide administrative services and present investment opportunities in addition certain of our officers and directors are also officers andor directors of the trust management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the trust therefore we account for our investment in the trust using the equity method of accounting we earned an advisory fee from the trust which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income of approximately 24 million during 2013 21 million during 2012 and 20 million during 2011  our pretax share of income from the trust was 842000 during 2013 12 million during 2012 and 46 million during 2011 and is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year included in our share of the trusts income for 2012 and 2011 was approximately 500000 in 2012 and 37 million in 2011 related to our share of the net favorable impact realized by the trust in connection with i gains on the sale of medical office buildings in 2012 and 2011 and ii gain on fair value recognition resulting from the trusts purchase of minority ownership interests in majority owned limited liability companies partially offset by a provision for asset impairment in 2011  the carrying value of our investment in the trust was 81 million and 93 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the market value of our investment in the trust was 315 million at december 31 2013 and 399 million at december 31 2012 based on the closing price of the trusts stock on the respective dates  total rent expense under the operating leases on the four hospital facilities with the trust as discussed below was 164 million during 2013 and 163 million during each of 2012 and 2011 in addition certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings owned by limited liability companies in which the trust holds either 100 of the ownership interest or various noncontrolling majority ownership interests  the trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries most of the leases were entered into at the time the trust commenced operations and provided for initial terms of 13 to 15 years with up to six additional 5year renewal terms each lease also provided for additional or bonus rental as discussed below the base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents are computed and paid on a quarterly basis based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year the leases with our subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are crossdefaulted with one another  pursuant to the terms of the leases with the trust we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above by providing notice to the trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term in addition we have rights of first refusal to i purchase the respective leased facilities during and for 180 days after the lease terms at the same price terms and conditions of any thirdparty offer or ii renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of and for 180 days after the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any thirdparty offer we also have the right to purchase the respective leased facilities at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms at their appraised fair market value as well as purchase any or all of the four leased hospital properties at their

chief financial officer    14    table of contents   item 1a risk factors  we are subject to numerous known and unknown risks many of which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also impact our business and results of operations  a significant portion of our revenue is produced by facilities located in nevada texas and california  nevada we own 6 acute care hospitals and 4 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties we owned two additional behavioral health facilities which were acquired by us from psi in november 2010 before the facilities were divested during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 pursuant to our agreement with the federal trade commission as discussed herein on a combined basis these facilities contributed 16 during each of 2013 and 2012 and 17 in 2011 of our consolidated net revenues on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 6 in 2013 8 in 2012 and 11 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  texas we own 7 acute care hospitals and 22 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 18 of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2013 2012 and 2011 on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 15 in 2013 12 in 2012 and 14 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  california we own 5 acute care hospitals and 6 behavioral healthcare facilities as listed in item 2 properties on a combined basis these facilities contributed 9 in 2013 and 10 of our consolidated net revenues during each of 2012 and 2011 on a combined basis after deducting an allocation for corporate overhead expense these facilities generated 4 in 2013 6 in 2012 and 5 in 2011 of our income from operations after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  the significant portion of our revenues and earnings derived from these facilities makes us particularly sensitive to legislative regulatory economic environmental and competition changes in nevada texas and california any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory economic environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results  our revenues and results of operations are significantly affected by payments received from the government and other third party payors  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from thirdparty payors including the medicare and medicaid programs changes in these government programs in recent years have resulted in limitations on reimbursement and in some cases reduced levels of reimbursement for healthcare services payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes administrative rulings interpretations and determinations requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities we are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations in addition the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of among other things the substantial deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for medicare and medicaid programs if the rates paid or the scope of services covered by government payors are reduced there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations  we receive medicaid revenues in excess of 90 million annually from each of texas pennsylvania washington dc illinois virginia and massachusetts making us particularly sensitive to reductions in    15    table of contents  medicaid and other state based revenue programs which have been implemented in various forms with respect to our areas of operation in the respective 2013 state fiscal years as well as regulatory economic environmental and competitive changes in those states based upon the state budgets for the 2013 fiscal year which generally began at various times during the second half of 2012 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates were reduced by approximately 1 or approximately 15 million annually from the average rates in effect during the states 2012 fiscal years which generally ended during the third quarter of 2012 based upon the state budgets for the 2014 fiscal year which will generally began at various times during the second half of 2013 we estimate that on a blended basis our aggregate medicaid rates will remain relatively unchanged from the 2013 fiscal year rates  in addition to changes in government reimbursement programs our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private payors including managed care providers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals private payors including managed care providers increasingly are demanding that we accept lower rates of payment  we expect continued thirdparty efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls reductions in reimbursement amounts received from thirdparty payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations  a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states could materially affect our business and future results of operations  our patient volumes revenues and financial results depend significantly on the universe of patients with health insurance which to a large extent is dependent on the employment status of individuals in our markets a continuation or worsening of economic conditions may result in a continued high unemployment rate which will likely increase the number of individuals without health insurance as a result our facilities may experience a decrease in patient volumes particularly in less intense more elective service lines or a significant increase in services provided to uninsured patients these factors could have a material unfavorable impact on our future patient volumes revenues and operating results  our patient revenues and payor mix during the last few years were adversely affected by economic conditions particularly in certain markets such as nevada texas and california where a significant portion of our revenues are concentrated and unemployment rates remain high in our acute care business we experienced net revenue pressures caused primarily by declining commercial payor utilization and an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients treated at our facilities we can provide no assurance that these trends will not continue during 2013 our revenues and payor mix within our acute care operations have been volatile making it difficult to predict the results for 2014 or thereafter  in addition we recorded approximately 237 billion of aggregate goodwill as a result of our acquisition of psi in november 2010 and ascend in october 2012 and as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 305 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet should the revenues and financial results of our acute care andor behavioral health care facilities be materially unfavorably impacted due to among other things a worsening of the economic and employment conditions in the united states that could negatively impact our patient volumes and reimbursement rates a continued rise in the unemployment rate and continued increases in the number of uninsured patients treated at our facilities we may incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  reductions or changes in medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  on january 3 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the 2012 act the 2012 act postponed for two months sequestration cuts mandated under the budget control act of    16    table of contents  2011 the postponed sequestration cuts include a 2 annual reduction over ten years in medicare spending to providers medicaid is exempt from sequestration the 2012 act provides a oneyear fix to statutory reductions in physician reimbursement and extends other medicare provisions in order to offset the cost of these extensions the 2012 act reduces payments to other providers totaling almost 26 billion over ten years approximately half of those funds will come from reductions in medicare reimbursement to hospitals although the bipartisan budget act of 2013 has reduced certain sequestrationrelated budgetary cuts spending reductions related to the medicare program remain in place on december 26 2013 president obama signed into law hj res 59 the bipartisan budget act of 2013 which includes the pathway for sgr reform act of 2013 the act in addition on february 15 2014 public law 113082 was enacted the act and subsequent federal legislation achieves new savings by extending sequestration for mandatory programs  including medicare  for another three years through 2024 please see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sources of revenuemedicare for additional disclosure  the 2012 act includes a document and coding dci adjustment and a reduction in medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments expected to save 105 billion over 10 years the dci adjustment decreases projected medicare hospital payments for inpatient and overnight care through a downward adjustment in annual base payment increases these reductions are meant to recoup what medicare authorities consider to be overpayments to hospitals that occurred as a result of the transition to medicare severity diagnosis related groups the reduction in medicaid dsh payments is expected to save 42 billion over 10 years this provision extends the changes regarding dsh payments established by the legislation and determines future allotments off of the rebased level  we are subject to uncertainties regarding health care reform  on march 23 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca the healthcare and education reconciliation act of 2010 the reconciliation act which contains a number of amendments to the ppaca was signed into law on march 30 2010 two primary goals of the ppaca combined with the reconciliation act collectively referred to as the legislation are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcarerelated expenses  although it is expected that as a result of the legislation there may be a reduction in uninsured patients which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts receivable the legislation makes a number of other changes to medicare and medicaid which we believe may have an adverse impact on us it has been projected that the legislation will result in a net reduction in medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals totaling 155 billion over 10 years the legislation revises reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals the legislation provides for decreases in the annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019 a productivity offset to the market basket update beginning october 1 2011 for medicare part b reimbursable items and services and beginning october 1 2012 for medicare inpatient hospital services the legislation and subsequent revisions provide for reductions to both medicare dsh and medicaid dsh payments the medicare dsh reductions began in october 2013 with no material adverse impact to the reimbursements we receive expected until 2015 while medicaid dsh reimbursements would not be adversely impacted until 2016 the legislation implements a valuebased purchasing program which will reward the delivery of efficient care conversely certain facilities will receive reduced reimbursement for failing to meet quality parameters such hospitals will include those with excessive readmission or hospitalacquired condition rates  a 2012 us supreme court ruling limited the federal governments ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the legislation that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain medicaid coverage requirements pursuant to that decision the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the medicaid expansion program by reducing their existing medicaid funding therefore states can choose to accept or not to participate without risking the loss of    17    table of contents  federal medicaid funding as a result many states including texas have not expanded their medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding  the various provisions in the legislation that directly or indirectly affect medicare and medicaid reimbursement are scheduled to take effect over a number of years the impact of the legislation on healthcare providers will be subject to implementing regulations interpretive guidance and possible future legislation certain legislation provisions such as those creating the medicare shared savings program and the independent payment advisory board create uncertainty in how healthcare may be reimbursed by federal programs in the future thus we cannot predict the impact of the legislation on our future reimbursement at this time and we can provide no assurance that the legislation will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  the legislation also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare the legislation amends several existing laws including the federal antikickback statute and the false claims act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers while congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the antikickback statute to provide that a person is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law the legislation also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the antikickback statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil false claims act the legislation provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil false claims act although final regulations implementing this statutory requirement remain pending the legislation also expands the recovery audit contractor program to medicaid these amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations  we have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities these investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician selfreferral law the legislation permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital the legislation also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physicianowned hospitals and restricts the ability of physicianowned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities  the impact of the legislation on each of our hospitals may vary because legislation provisions are effective at various times over the next several years we anticipate that many of the provisions in the legislation may be subject to further revision we cannot predict the impact the legislation may have on our business results of operations cash flow capital resources and liquidity or whether we will be able to successfully adapt to the changes required by the legislation  we are required to treat patients with emergency medical conditions regardless of ability to pay  in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as well as the emergency medical treatment and active labor act or emtala we provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to one of our hospitals while in active labor andor seeking medical treatment whether or not such individual is eligible for insurance benefits and regardless of ability to pay to determine if such individual has an emergency medical condition if it is determined that such person has an emergency medical condition we provide such further medical examination and treatment as is required to stabilize the patients medical condition within the facilitys capability or arrange for transfer of such individual to another medical facility in accordance with applicable law and the treating hospitals written procedures our obligations under emtala may increase substantially going forward cms has sought stakeholder comments concerning the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively but has yet to issue further guidance in response to that request if the number of indigent and charity care    18    table of contents  patients with emergency medical conditions we treat increases significantly or if regulations expanding our obligations to inpatients under emtala is proposed and adopted our results of operations will be harmed  if we are not able to provide high quality medical care at a reasonable price patients may choose to receive their health care from our competitors  in recent years the number of quality measures that hospitals are required to report publicly has increased cms publishes performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with the medicare program federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported additionally the legislation requires all hospitals to annually establish update and make public a list of their standard charges for products and services if any of our hospitals achieve poor results on the quality measures or patient satisfaction surveys or results that are lower than our competitors or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors our patient volume could decline because patients may elect to use competing hospitals or other health care providers that have better metrics and pricing this circumstance could harm our business and results of operations  an increase in uninsured and underinsured patients in our acute care facilities or the deterioration in the collectability of the accounts of such patients could harm our results of operations  collection of receivables from thirdparty payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill that is the patients responsibility which primarily includes copayments and deductibles however we also have substantial receivables due to us as of december 31 2013 a significant portion of which is past due from certain statebased funding programs most particularly illinois and texas as discussed herein we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix the agings of the receivables historical collection experience and assessment of probability of future collections we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted significant changes in business office operations payor mix economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable cash flow and results of operations if we experience unexpected increases in the growth of uninsured and underinsured patients or in bad debt expenses our results of operations will be harmed  our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers  the healthcare industry is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physicians has intensified in recent years in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sales and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us  in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we the number of inpatient facilities as well as outpatient surgical and diagnostic centers many of which are fully or partially owned by physicians in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly as a result most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment  if our competitors are better able to attract patients recruit physicians and other healthcare professionals expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities we may experience a decline in patient volume and our business may be harmed    19    table of contents our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians  typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment as a result the success and competitive advantage of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals the admitting practices of those physicians and our maintenance of good relations with those physicians physicians generally are not employees of our hospitals and in a number of our markets physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals they may terminate their affiliation with us at any time if we are unable to provide high ethical and professional standards adequate support personnel and technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities and our results of operations may decline  it may become difficult for us to attract and retain an adequate number of physicians to practice in certain of the nonurban communities in which our hospitals are located our failure to recruit physicians to these communities or the loss of physicians in these communities could make it more difficult to attract patients to our hospitals and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  generally the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions the loss of one or more of these physicians even if temporary could cause a material reduction in our revenues which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians  if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected  the technology used in medical equipment and related devices is constantly evolving and as a result manufacturers and distributors continue to offer new and upgraded products to health care providers to compete effectively we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade when significant technological advances occur if our facilities do not stay current with technological advances in the health care industry patients may seek treatment from other providers andor physicians may refer their patients to alternate sources which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business  if we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems our operations could be harmed  as required by hitech we are in the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology if our facilities or physicians are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing an electronic health record system further beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be subject to reduced payments from medicare any failure by us to effectively implement an electronic health record system in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and medical support staff and we face competition for staffing that may increase our labor costs and harm our results of operations  we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other healthcare professionals we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel    20    table of contents the nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may be required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues  we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of attracting and retaining talented medical support staff if our general labor and related expenses increase we may not be able to raise our rates correspondingly our failure to either recruit and retain qualified hospital management nurses and other medical support personnel or control our labor costs could harm our results of operations  increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs union organizing activities and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionized it is possible our labor costs could increase materially  if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations we could suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could reduce our revenue and profitability  the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal state and local government levels relating to among other things hospital billing practices and prices for services relationships with physicians and other referral sources adequacy of medical care and quality of medical equipment and services ownership of facilities qualifications of medical and support personnel confidentiality maintenance privacy and security issues associated with healthrelated information and patient medical records the screening stabilization and transfer of patients who have emergency medical conditions certification licensure and accreditation of our facilities operating policies and procedures and construction or expansion of facilities and services  among these laws are the federal false claims act the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the federal antikickback statute and the provision of the social security act commonly known as the stark law these laws and particularly the antikickback statute and the stark law impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and other referral sources we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our facilities including employment contracts leases and professional service agreements we also provide financial incentives including minimum revenue guarantees to recruit physicians into communities served by our hospitals the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the antikickback statute a number of our current arrangements including financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources may not qualify for safe harbor protection under the antikickback statute failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the antikickback statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny we cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the antikickback statute cms recently published a medicare selfreferral disclosure protocol which is intended to allow providers to selfdisclose actual or potential violations of the stark law because there are only a few judicial decisions interpreting the stark law there can be no assurance that our hospitals will not be found in violation of the stark law or that selfdisclosure of a potential violation would result in reduced penalties  federal regulations issued under hipaa contain provisions that require us to implement and in the future may require us to implement additional costly electronic media security systems and to adopt new business practices designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patients health and related financial information such privacy and security regulations impose extensive administrative physical and technical    21    table of contents  requirements on us restrict our use and disclosure of certain patient health and financial information provide patients with rights with respect to their health information and require us to enter into contracts extending many of the privacy and security regulatory requirements to third parties that perform duties on our behalf additionally recent changes to hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf  these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation in the future it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws see item 3legal proceedings or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be see item 1 businessselfreferral and antikickback legislation  if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  we are subject to occupational health safety and other similar regulations and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business and results of operations  we are subject to a wide variety of federal state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations regulatory requirements affecting us include but are not limited to those covering i air and water quality control ii occupational health and safety eg standards regarding bloodborne pathogens and ergonomics etc iii waste management iv the handling of asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls and radioactive substances and v other hazardous materials if we fail to comply with those standards we may be subject to sanctions and penalties that could harm our business and results of operations  we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities  we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits product liability lawsuits class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters we may choose to negotiate a settlement amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations we believe that based on our past experience and actuarial estimates our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operations of our hospitals while we continuously monitor our coverage our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates if such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  we may be subject to governmental investigations regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits  the federal false claims act permits private parties to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government    22    table of contents  alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government and as a result the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware please see item 3 legal proceedings for disclosure of current related matters  the failure of certain employers or the closure of certain facilities could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals  the economies in the nonurban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers those employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and other health care facilities for their care the failure of one or more large employer or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at facilities located in or near the communities where our hospitals operate could cause affected employees to move elsewhere to seek employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them the occurrence of these events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations thereby harming our business  if any of our existing health care facilities lose their accreditation or any of our new facilities fail to receive accreditation such facilities could become ineligible to receive reimbursement under medicare or medicaid  the construction and operation of healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local regulation relating to among other things the adequacy of medical care equipment personnel operating policies and procedures fire prevention ratesetting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection additionally such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by government authorities to assure their continued compliance with these various standards  all of our hospitals are deemed certified meaning that they are accredited properly licensed under the relevant state laws and regulations and certified under the medicare program the effect of maintaining certified facilities is to allow such facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs we believe that all of our healthcare facilities are in material compliance with applicable federal state local and other relevant regulations and standards however should any of our healthcare facilities lose their deemed certified status and thereby lose certification under the medicare or medicaid programs such facilities would be unable to receive reimbursement from either of those programs and our business could be materially adversely effected  our growth strategy depends in part on acquisitions and we may not be able to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our target criteria we may also have difficulties acquiring hospitals from notforprofit entities due to regulatory scrutiny  acquisitions of hospitals in select markets are a key element of our growth strategy we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit healthcare companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do also suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms  in addition many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws that affect the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the state attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over such transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a healthcare facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions or our inability to effectively compete against other potential purchasers could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional hospitals increase our acquisition costs or make it difficult for us to acquire hospitals that meet our target acquisition criteria any of which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations    23    table of contents further the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations depending on various factors including the amount paid for the acquisition the acquired hospitals results of operations allocation of the purchase price effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases  we may fail to improve or integrate the operations of the hospitals we acquire which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect our growth strategy  we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel in addition acquisition activity requires transitions from and the integration of operations and usually information systems that are used by acquired hospitals in addition some of the hospitals we acquire had significantly lower operating margins than the hospitals we operate prior to the time of our acquisition if we fail to improve the operating margins of the hospitals we acquire operate such hospitals profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired hospitals our results of operations could be harmed  if we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities we could become liable for material obligations  hospitals that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities including but not limited to liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such hospitals for these matters we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of hospitals we acquire such liabilities and related legal or other costs andor resulting damage to a facilitys reputation could harm our business  our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions  our subsidiaries psi and its subsidiaries are subject to pending legal actions governmental investigations and regulatory actions see item 3legal proceedings  state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to expand  many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need or con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services our failure to obtain necessary state approval could result in our inability to complete a particular hospital acquisition expansion or replacement make a facility ineligible to receive reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs result in the revocation of a facilitys license or impose civil or criminal penalties on us any of which could harm our business  in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations  controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues  controls imposed by thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as utilization review have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient    24    table of contents  utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue although we cannot predict the effect these changes will have on our operations significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations  our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control  our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors including physicians clinical decisions and availability payor programs shifting to a more outpatientbased environment whether or not certain services are offered seasonal and severe weather conditions including the effects of extreme low temperatures hurricanes and tornados earthquakes current local economic and demographic changes in addition technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer  fluctuations in our operating results quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in decreases in the price of our common stock  the stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to operating performance these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and as a result there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock if we are unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the past or as our stockholders expect us to in the future the market price of our common stock will likely decline as stockholders could sell shares of our common stock when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized  in addition to our operating results many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings these factors include certain of the risks discussed herein demographic changes operating results of other hospital companies changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts speculation in the press or investment community the possible effects of war terrorist and other hostilities adverse weather conditions the level of seasonal illnesses managed care contract negotiations and terminations changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the health care industry  we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price  as a publicly traded company we are subject to a significant body of regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations for example we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form 10k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions fines or other sanctions or litigation if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting our stock price could decline    25    table of contents a cyber security incident could cause a violation of hipaa breach of member privacy or other negative impacts  a cyberattack that bypasses our information technology it security systems causing an it security breach loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws loss of proprietary business information or a

could be adversely impacted by theft destruction loss or misappropriation of public health information other confidential data or proprietary business information  different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  generally accepted accounting principles are complex continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  we continue to see rising costs in construction materials and labor such increased costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flow return on investment relating to our capital projects  the cost of construction materials and labor has significantly increased as we continue to invest in modern technologies emergency rooms and operating room expansions the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and reconfiguring the flow of patient care we spend large amounts of money generated from our operating cash flow or borrowed funds although we evaluate the financial feasibility of such projects by determining whether the projected cash flow return on investment exceeds our cost of capital such returns may not be achieved if the cost of construction continues to rise significantly or the expected patient volumes are not attained  the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding and we cannot be certain of the availability and terms of capital to fund the growth of our business when needed  we require substantial capital resources to fund our acquisition growth strategy and our ongoing capital expenditure programs for renovation expansion construction and addition of medical equipment and technology we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand improve and equip our existing hospitals we cannot predict however whether financing for our growth plans and capital expenditure programs will be available to us on satisfactory terms when needed which could harm our business  to fund all or a portion of our future financing needs we rely on borrowings from various sources including fixed rate longterm debt as well as borrowings pursuant to our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program if any of the lenders were unable to fulfill their future commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could have a material unfavorable impact our results of operations and financial condition  in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity    26    table of contents we depend heavily on key management personnel and the departure of one or more of our key executives or a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could harm our business  the expertise and efforts of our senior executives and key members of our local hospital management personnel are critical to the success of our business the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or of a significant portion of our local hospital management personnel could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient quality healthcare services at our facilities

material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations  general  the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations which include among other things matters such as government healthcare participation requirements various licensure certifications and accreditations reimbursement for patient services and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse government action has increased with respect to investigations andor allegations concerning possible violations of fraud and abuse and false claims statutes andor regulations by healthcare providers currently and from time

are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving

litigation or governmental or internal investigations including the matters described above cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated no estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued if any can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors including but not limited to i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate ii discovery is not complete iii the proceeding is in its early stages iv the matters present legal uncertainties v there are significant facts in dispute vi there are a large number of parties or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes it is possible that the outcome of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations
