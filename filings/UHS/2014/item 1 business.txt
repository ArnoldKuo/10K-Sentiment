         innovation in service delivery  business strategy  we believe communitybased hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of selfdetermination for both the company and our hospitals  acquisition of additional hospitals we selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities we are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities we also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy  improvement of operations of existing hospitals and services we also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services improvement of existing services physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls  we are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities from time to time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need or cons although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts  quality and efficiency of services pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payors to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible we are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services in addition in response to cost containment pressures we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures in addition we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients physicians employees communities and our stockholders  in addition our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities  2013 acquisition and divestiture activity  acquisitions of assets and businesses  during 2013 we spent 13 million for the purchase of real property located in pennsylvania nevada and arizona    2    table of contents divestitures  during 2013 we received 37 million in connection with the divestiture of peak behavioral health services and certain other assets and real property including three previously closed behavioral health care facilities we agreed to sell peak behavioral health services as part of our agreement with the federal trade commission in connection with our acquisition of ascend health corporation in october of 2012 the aggregate pretax gain on these divestitures did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2013  hospital utilization  we believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility generally we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services level of technology emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians other factors that affect utilization include general and local economic conditions market penetration of managed care programs the degree of outpatient use the availability of reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice medical technology and pharmacology current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors we are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate in addition hospital operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year  the following table sets forth certain operating statistics for hospitals operated by us for the years indicated accordingly information related to hospitals acquired

3 patient days is the sum of all patients for the number of days that hospital care is provided to each patient    4 occupancy rate is calculated by dividing average patient days total patient days

including managed care plans the federal government under the medicare program state governments under their respective medicaid programs and directly from patients see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssources of revenue for additional disclosure other information related to our revenues income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements segment reporting   regulation and other factors  overview the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws regulations and rules including among others those related to government healthcare participation requirements various licensure and accreditations reimbursement for patient services health information privacy and security rules and medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse provisions including but not limited to federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources false claims submitted to federal health care programs    4    table of contents  and selfreferrals by physicians providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to significant fines or penalties andor required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions or that we would not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties if so subjected even if we were to ultimately prevail a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us  licensing certification and accreditation all of our hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal state and local statutes and regulations and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care equipment and cleanliness our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal state and local health agencies as well as the requirements of municipal building codes health codes and local fire departments various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment  all of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by the joint commission all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare and medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities  if any of our facilities were to lose its joint commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and medicaid programs the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs and other payors we believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal state local and independent review body regulations and standards the requirements for licensure certification and accreditation are subject to change and in order to remain qualified it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel and services in the future which could have a material adverse impact on operations  certificates of need many of the states in which we operate hospitals have enacted certificates of need con laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures construction expansion modernization or initiation of major new services failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition expansion or replacement the imposition of civil or in some cases criminal sanctions the inability to receive medicare or medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facilitys license which could harm our business in addition significant con reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements in the past we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations  conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of notforprofit hospitals to forprofit entities these laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general advance notification and community involvement in addition attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions although the level of government involvement varies from state to state the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and in some cases approval of a transaction in which a notforprofit entity sells a health care facility to a forprofit entity the adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of notforprofit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of notforprofit hospitals  utilization review federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services the law and regulations require peer review organizations pros to review the appropriateness of medicare and    5    table of contents  medicaid patient admissions and discharges the quality of care provided the validity of diagnosis related group drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay pros may deny payment for services provided assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the pro be excluded from participating in the medicare program we have contracted with pros in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews  audits most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of medicare and medicaid program submitted claims if these audits identify overpayments we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years payments subject to various administrative appeal rights the federal government contracts with thirdparty recovery audit contractors racs and medicaid integrity contractors mics on a contingent fee basis to audit the propriety of payments to medicare and medicaid providers the recovery audit prepayment review demonstration program will enable racs to review claims before they are paid to ensure that the provider complied with all medicare payment rules currently the demonstration program is targeting states with high populations of fraud and errorprone providers similarly medicare zone program integrity contractors zpics target claims for potential fraud and abuse additionally medicare administrative contractors macs must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms recently announced its intent to consolidate many of these medicare and medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors upics though it remains unclear what effect if any this proposed consolidation may have we have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations however potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves and any excess could potentially be substantial further medicare and medicaid regulations also provide for withholding medicare and medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances which could adversely affect our cash flow  selfreferral and antikickback legislation  the stark law the social security act includes a provision commonly known as the stark law this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship unless an exception is met these types of referrals are known as selfreferrals sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to 15000 for each violation up to 100000 for sham arrangements up to 10000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal health care programs there are a number of exceptions to the selfreferral prohibition including an exception for a physicians ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit service or subpart however federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities this recent regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physicianowned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers including employment contracts leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements  we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards nonetheless because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the stark law  antikickback statute a provision of the social security act known as the antikickback statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting receiving offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using referring ordering recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state    6    table of contents  health care program however recent changes to the antikickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the antikickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law  the antikickback statute contains certain exceptions and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig has issued regulations that provide for safe harbors from the federal antikickback statute for various activities these activities which must meet certain requirements include but are not limited to the following investment interests space rental equipment rental practitioner recruitment personnel services and management contracts sale of practice referral services warranties discounts employees group purchasing organizations waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts managed care arrangements obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies investments in group practices freestanding surgery centers donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the antikickback statute however such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities  although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the antikickback statute or other applicable laws violations of the antikickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to 25000 for each violation or imprisonment however under 18 usc section 3571 this fine may be increased to 250000 for individuals and 500000 for organizations civil money penalties may include fines of up to 50000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration andor exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid  similar state laws many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the antikickback statute and the stark law some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure in many instances the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes however in most cases little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws  these laws and regulations are extremely complex and in many cases we dont have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation it is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities equipment personnel services capital expenditure programs and operating expenses a determination that we have violated one or more of these laws or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws see legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly in addition we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be  if we are deemed to have failed to comply with the antikickback statute the stark law or other applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to liabilities including criminal penalties civil penalties including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations  federal false claims act and similar state regulations a current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act and in particular actions being brought by individuals on the governments behalf under the false claims acts qui tam or whistleblower provisions    7    table of contents  whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government  when a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the false claims act the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 to 11000 for each separate false claim there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government the fraud enforcement and recovery act of 2009 fera has expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the false claims act eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds fera also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention as well as the receipt of overpayments in addition recent changes to the antikickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil false claims act further a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court recent changes to the false claims act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified or by the date any corresponding cost report was due whichever is later failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil false claims act liability  other fraud and abuse provisions the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid false claims include but are not limited to billing for services not rendered billing for services without prescribed documentation misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud like the antikickback statute these provisions are very broad  further the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs hipaa also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in medicare there are civil penalties for prohibited conduct including but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services  hipaa administrative simplification and privacy requirements the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry hipaa also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed violations of hipaa can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties  we believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of hipaa as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance the hipaa security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of patient information hitech has since strengthened certain hipaa rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information extended certain hipaa provisions to business associates and created new security breach notification requirements hitech has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a hipaa violation has occurred we believe that we have been in substantial compliance with hipaa and hitech requirements to date recent changes to the hipaa regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers including expanded obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data as well as create new liabilities for the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf    8    table of contents red flags rule in addition the federal trade commission ftc red flags rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft the red flag program clarification act of 2010 signed on december 18 2010 appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the red flags rule but permits the ftc or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the red flags rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future  patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 on july 29 2005 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 was enacted which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety this legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report patient safety work product pswp to patient safety organizations psos under the system pswp is made privileged confidential and legally protected from disclosure pswp does not include medical discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety this legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute pswp psos are certified by the secretary of the hhs for threeyear periods and analyze pswp provide feedback to providers and may report nonidentifiable pswp to a database in addition psos are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies  environmental regulations our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal state and local environmental laws rules and regulations infectious waste generators including hospitals face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste including civil penalties of up to 25000 per day of noncompliance criminal penalties of up to 50000 per day imprisonment and remedial costs in addition our operations as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws rules and regulations we believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws  corporate practice of medicine several states including florida nevada california and texas have laws andor regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or feesplitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to or the recommendation of particular providers for medical products and services possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties in addition agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable these statutes andor regulations vary from state to state are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies we do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and feesplitting with physicians we do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements  emtala all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law generally requires hospitals that are certified providers under medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospitals emergency room for treatment and if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency to either stabilize the patients condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patients ability to pay for treatment there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patients ability to pay penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program in addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under emtala an injured patient the patients family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospitals violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute    9    table of contents the federal government broadly interprets emtala to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospitals emergency room but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospitals campus generally or to a hospitalbased clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospitalowned ambulance subject to certain exceptions emtala does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services however cms has recently sought industry comments on the potential applicability of emtala to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities respectively cms has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments the government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce emtala violations actively in the future we believe that we operate in substantial compliance with emtala  health care industry investigations we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings included herein for additional disclosure in addition currently and from time to time some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries andor actions and receive notices of potential noncompliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs subjected to potential licensure certification andor accreditation revocation subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services  we monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices including ours although we believe our policies procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions or that we will not be faced with sanctions fines or penalties in connection with the investigations even if we were to ultimately prevail the governments inquiry andor action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results  our substantial medicare medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations it is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity it is also possible that our executives andor managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation andor named as defendants in private litigation  revenue rulings 9815 and 200451 in march 1998 and may 2004 the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between forprofit and notforprofit hospitals as a result of the tax rulings the irs has proposed and may in the future propose to revoke the taxexempt or public charity status of certain notforprofit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them the tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the irs or the courts regarding the taxexempt or public charity status of a notforprofit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with notforprofit hospitals andor require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with notforprofits  state rate review some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state in the aggregate state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected our results of operations  medical malpractice tort law reform medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level all states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits over half of the states have limits on    10    table of contents  damages awards almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits and many states have established limits on attorney fees many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform proposed solutions include enacting limits on noneconomic damages malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates reform legislation has also been proposed but not adopted at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area  compliance program our companywide compliance program has been in place since 1998 currently the programs elements include a code of conduct risk area specific policies and procedures employee education and training an internal system for reporting concerns auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies  since its initial adoption the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs specific written policies procedures training and educational materials and programs as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program claims preparation and submission including coding billing and cost reports comprise the bulk of these areas financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources including compliance with antikickback and stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training standardized documentation requirements and review and audit  medical staff and employees  our facilities had approximately 66100 employees on december 31 2013 of whom approximately 47000 were employed fulltime our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals in a number of our markets physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours within our acute care division approximately 140 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time in addition within our behavioral health division approximately 380 psychiatrists are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501a corporations each of our hospitals is managed on a daytoday basis by a managing director employed by a subsidiary of ours in addition a board of governors including members of the hospitals medical staff governs the medical professional and ethical practices at each hospital we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  approximately 1600 of our employees at five of

and an appeal the results have not yet been certified the national labor relations board is currently reviewing the appeal    11    table of contents competition  the health care industry is highly competitive in recent years competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the united states due to among other things regulatory and technological changes increasing use of managed care payment systems cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment in all of the geographical areas in which we operate there are other hospitals that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals in addition some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by taxsupported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property sale and income taxes such exemptions and support are not available to us  in some markets certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical surgical and behavioral health services facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals the increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical also increases competition for us  the number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff are important factors in determining a hospitals success and competitive advantage typically physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment we believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patients needs the quality of other physicians on the medical staff the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospitals facilities we strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians  in addition we depend on the efforts abilities and experience of our medical support personnel including our nurses pharmacists and lab technicians and other health care professionals we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management nurses and other medical personnel our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate in addition in some markets like california there are requirements to maintain specified nursestaffing levels to the extent we cannot meet those levels we may by required to limit the healthcare services provided in these markets which would have a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues  many states in which we operate hospitals have con laws the application process for approval of additional covered services new facilities changes in operations and capital expenditures is therefore highly competitive in these states in those states that do not have con laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities competition in the form of new services facilities and capital spending is more prevalent see regulation and other factors  our ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment in addition employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges in return hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients generally hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price market reputation geographic location quality and range of services quality of the medical staff and convenience the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations    12    table of contents a key element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets the competition to acquire hospitals is significant we face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other forprofit health care companies as well as from notforprofit entities some of our competitors have greater resources than we do we intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms  relationship with universal health realty income trust  at december 31 2013 we
