and semiprecious metals and stones diamonds account for about 45 and gold about 15 of signets cost of merchandise sold respectivelysignet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of net zerocost collar arrangements forward contracts and commodity purchasing it is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds the cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry with labor costs also being a significant factor diamond sourcingsignet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and to a smaller extent as loose cutandpolished stones and rough stonesfinished jewelrymerchandise is purchased as finished product where the items are relatively more complex have less predictable sales patterns or where it is cost effective to do so this method of buying inventory provides the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers thereby reducing the risk of over or underpurchasing signets scale strong balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable termsloose diamondssignet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets eg india israel from a variety of sources eg polishers traders signet mounts stones in settings purchased from

conditions therefore a decline in consumer spending whether due to adverse changes in the economy changes in tax policy or other factors that reduce our customers demand for our products may unfavorably impact signets future sales and earnings23table of contentsjewelry purchases are discretionary and are dependent on consumers perceptions of general economic conditions particularly as jewelry is often perceived to be a luxury purchase adverse changes in the economy and periods when discretionary spending by consumers may be under pressure could unfavorably impact sales and earnings we may respond by increasing discounts or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and operating resultsthe success of signets operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers consumer confidence level of customer traffic in shopping malls and other retail centers employment the rate of change in employment the level of consumers disposable income and income available for discretionary expenditure the savings ratio business conditions interest rates consumer debt and asset values availability of credit and levels of taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate signets success also depends upon its reputation for integrity in sourcing its merchandise which if adversely affected could impact consumer sentiment and willingness to purchase signets merchandiseas 13 of signets sales are accounted for by its uk jewelry division economic conditions in the eurozone have a significant impact on the uk economy even though the uk is not a member of the eurozone therefore developments in the eurozone could adversely impact trading in the uk jewelry division in addition developments in the eurozone could also adversely impact the us economymore than half of sales in the sterling jewelers division are made utilizing customer finance provided by signet therefore any deterioration in the consumers financial position or changes to the regulatory requirements regarding the granting of credit to customers could adversely impact sales earnings and the collectability of accounts receivable more than half of signets sales in the us and canada utilize its inhouse customer financing programs or third party provided customer financing programs and about a further 40 of purchases are made using third party bank cards any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increase in consumer debt levels may inhibit consumers use of credit and decrease the consumers ability to satisfy signets requirement for access to customer finance and could in turn have an adverse effect on the sterling jewelers divisions sales furthermore any downturn in general or local economic conditions in particular an increase in unemployment in the markets in which the sterling jewelers division operates may adversely affect its collection of outstanding accounts receivable its net bad debt charge and hence earningsadditionally signets ability to extend credit to customers and the terms on which it is achieved depends on many factors including compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the us and canada any of which may change from time to time and such changes in law relating to the provision of credit and associated services could adversely affect sales and income in addition other restrictions arising from applicable law could cause limitations in credit terms currently offered or a reduction in the level of credit granted by the company or by third parties and this could adversely impact sales income or cash flow as could any reduction in the level of credit granted by the sterling jewelers division or by third parties as a result of the restrictions placed on fees and interest chargedthe us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the us doddfrank act creates a bureau of consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking and supervisory authority for a wide range of consumer financial services including signets customer finance programs the bureaus authority became effective in july 2011 any new regulatory initiatives by the bureau could impose additional costs andor restrictions on credit practices on the sterling jewelers division which could adversely affect its ability to conduct its businesssignets share price may be volatilesignets share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in the actual or anticipated results and financial conditions of signet and other companies in the retail industry and the stock markets view of the acquisition of zale corporation in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other shares in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companiesthe concentration of a significant proportion of sales and an even larger share of profits in the fourth quarter means results are dependent on performance during that periodsignets business is highly seasonal with a significant proportion of its sales and operating profit generated during its fourth quarter which includes the holiday season management expects to continue to experience a seasonal fluctuation in its sales and earnings therefore there is limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in its operations and strategies in other quarters or to recover from any extensive disruption for example due to sudden adverse changes in consumer confidence inclement weather conditions having an impact on a significant number of stores in the last few days immediately before christmas day or disruption to warehousing and store replenishment systems a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any fiscal year would therefore be expected to have a material adverse effect on the annual results of operations disruption at lesser peaks in sales at valentines day and mothers day would be expected to impact the results to a lesser extent24table of contentsdeterioration in our capital structure or financial performance could result in constraints on capital or financial covenant breaches in addition a portion of the companys debt is variable rate and volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultswhile signet has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its operating requirements the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in signets capital structure or the quality and stability of earnings could result in a downgrade of signets credit rating any negative ratings actions could also constrain the capital available to the company could limit the companys access to funding for its operations and increase the companys financing costs the changes in general credit market conditions also affect signets ability to arrange and the cost of arranging credit facilities additionally as a result of the companys exposure to variable interest rate debt volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultssignets borrowing agreements include various financial covenants and operating restrictions a material deterioration in its financial performance could result in a covenant being breached if signet were to breach or believed it was going to breach a financial covenant it would have to renegotiate its terms with current lenders or find alternative sources of financing if current lenders required cancellation of facilities or early repaymentmovements in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact the results and balance sheet of signetsignet publishes its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars it held approximately 89 of its total assets in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar at january 31 2015 and generated approximately 83 of its sales and 91 of its operating income in us dollars for the fiscal year then ended nearly all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in uk british pounds and canadian dollars therefore its results and balance sheet are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and both the british pound and canadian dollar accordingly any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would decrease reported sales and operating incomethe monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk jewelry division and the canadian subsidiaries of the zale divisionwhere british pounds or canadian dollars are held or used to fund the cash flow requirements of the business any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and increase the amount of any british pounds or canadian dollar borrowingsin addition the prices of certain materials and products bought on the international markets by signet are denominated in foreign currencies as a result signet and its subsidiaries have exposures to exchange rate fluctuations on its cost of goods sold as well as volatility of input prices if foreign manufacturers and suppliers are impacted by exchange rate fluctuationsfluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities particularly polished diamonds and gold which account for the majority of signets merchandise costs could adversely impact its earnings and cash availabilitythe jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones in particular diamonds account for about 45 of signets merchandise costs and gold about 15 in fiscal 2015in fiscal 2015 polished diamond prices experienced a single digit percentage increase similar to that experienced in fiscal 2014 industry forecasts indicate that over the medium and longer term the demand for diamonds will probably increase faster than the growth in supply particularly as a result of growing demand in countries such as china and india therefore the cost of diamonds is anticipated to rise over time although fluctuations in price are likely to continue to occur the mining production and inventory policies followed by major producers of rough diamonds can have a significant impact on diamond prices as can the inventory and buying patterns of jewelry retailers and other parties in the supply chainwhile jewelry manufacturing is the major final demand for gold management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly impacted by investment transactions which have resulted in significant volatility and overall increases in gold cost over the past several years followed by somewhat of a decline in fiscal 2015 signets cost of merchandise and potentially its earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly escalatethe availability of diamonds is significantly influenced by the political situation in diamond producing countries including the impact of current and potential new sanctions on russia and by the kimberley process an intergovernmental agreement for the international trading of rough diamonds until acceptable alternative sources of diamonds can be developed any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from significant producing countries or to the trading in rough and polished diamonds which could occur as a result of disruption to the kimberley process could adversely affect signet as well as the retail jewelry market as a whole in 2012 the kimberley process chaired by the united states initiated a process to review ways to strengthen and reform the kimberley process including reviewing the definition of a conflict diamond in january 2013 south africa became the chair and the review process was expected to continue however no reform efforts were achieved in 2015 the kimberley process is being chaired by angola in addition the current kimberley process decision making procedure is dependent on reaching a consensus among member governments which can result in the protracted resolution of issues and there is little expectation of significant reform over the longterm the impact of this review process on the supply of diamonds and consumers perception of the diamond supply chain is unknown in addition to the kimberley process the supply of diamonds to the us is also impacted by certain governmental trade sanctions imposed on zimbabwe25table of contentsthe possibility of constraints in the supply of diamonds of a size and quality signet requires to meet its merchandising requirements may result in changes in signets supply chain practices for example its rough sourcing initiative in addition signet may from time to time choose to hold more inventory to purchase raw materials at an earlier stage in the supply chain or enter into commercial agreements of a nature that it currently does not use such actions could require the investment of cash andor additional management skills such actions may not result in the expected returns and other projected benefits anticipated by managementan inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability historically jewelry retailers have been able over time to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs however in general particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices as signet uses an average cost inventory methodology volatility in its commodity costs may also result in a time lag before cost increases are reflected in retail prices there is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur in addition any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customerin august 2012 the sec pursuant to the doddfrank act issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the gold supply chain is complex and while management believes that the rules currently cover less than 1 of annual worldwide gold production based upon recent estimates the final rules require signet and other jewelry retailers and manufacturers that file with the sec to make specified country of origin inquiries of our suppliers and otherwise to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin and certain other information relating to any of the statutorily designated minerals gold tin tantalum and tungsten that are used in products sold by signet in the us and elsewhere on may 30 2014 signet filed with the sec its form specialized disclosure sd and accompanying conflict minerals report in accordance with the secs rules which together describe our country of origin inquiries and due diligence measures relating to the source and chain of custody of those designated minerals signet deemed necessary to the functionality or production of our products the results of those activities and our related determinations with respect to the calendar year ended december 31 2013compliance with the secs conflict minerals disclosure rules require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries there may be reputational risks associated with the potential negative response of our customers and other stakeholders to future disclosures by signet in the event that due to the complexity of the global supply chain signet is unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the relevant metals also if future responses to verification requests by suppliers of any of the covered minerals used in our products are inadequate or adverse signets ability to obtain merchandise may be impaired and our compliance costs may increase the final rules also cover tungsten and tin which are contained in a small proportion of items that are sold by signet it is possible that other minerals such as diamonds could be subject to similar rulesprice increases may have an adverse impact on signets performanceif significant price increases are implemented by any division or across a wide range of merchandise the impact on earnings will depend on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products in the same geographic area and the response by the customer to higher prices such price increases may result in lower sales and adversely impact earningssignets competitors are specialty jewelry retailers as well as other jewelry retailers including department stores mass merchandisers discount stores apparel and accessory fashion stores brand retailers shopping clubs home shopping television channels direct home sellers online retailers and auction sites in addition other retail categories for example electronics and other forms of expenditure such as travel also compete for consumers discretionary expenditure this is particularly so during the holiday gift giving season therefore the price of jewelry relative to other products influences the proportion of consumers expenditure that is spent on jewelry if the relative price of jewelry increases signets sales and earnings may declinethe failure to satisfy the accounting requirements for hedge accounting or default or insolvency of a counterparty to a hedging contract could adversely impact resultssignet hedges a portion of its purchases of gold for both its sterling jewelers and uk jewelry divisions and hedges the us dollar requirements of its uk jewelry division the failure to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate accounting requirements or a default or insolvency of a counterparty to a contract could increase the volatility of results and may impact the timing of recognition of gains and losses in the income statementthe inability of signet to obtain merchandise that customers wish to purchase particularly ahead of and during the fourth quarter would adversely impact salesthe abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the fourth quarter would result in a material adverse effect on signets businessalso if management misjudges expected customer demand or fails to identify changes in customer demand andor its supply chain does not respond in a timely manner it could adversely impact signets results by causing either a shortage of merchandise or an accumulation of excess inventory26table of contentssignet benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results management holds regular reviews with major suppliers signets most significant supplier accounts for 6 of merchandise government requirements regarding sources of commodities such as those required by the doddfrank act could result in signet choosing to terminate relationships with suppliers in the future due to a change in a suppliers sourcing practices or signets compliance with laws and internal policiesluxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies the right to sell their ranges on a store by store basis and most of the leading brands have been steadily reducing the number of agencies in the us canada and the uk over recent years the watch brands sold by ernest jones and to a lesser extent jared help attract customers and build sales in all categories therefore an inability to obtain or retain watch agencies for a location could harm the performance of that particular store in the case of ernest jones the inability to gain additional prestige watch agencies is an important factor in and may reduce the likelihood of opening new stores which could adversely impact sales growththe growth in importance of branded merchandise within the jewelry market may adversely impact signets sales and earnings if it is unable to obtain supplies of branded merchandise that the customer wishes to purchase in addition if signet loses the distribution rights to an important branded jewelry range it could adversely impact sales and earningssignet has had success in recent years in the development of branded merchandise that is exclusive to its stores if signet is not able to further develop such branded merchandise or is unable to successfully develop further such initiatives it may adversely impact sales and earningsan inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsmanagement regards the customer experience as an essential element in the success of its business competition for suitable individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs therefore an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsloss of confidence by consumers in signets brand names poor execution of marketing programs and reduced marketing expenditure could have a detrimental impact on salesprimary factors in determining customer buying decisions in the jewelry sector include customer confidence in the retailer and in the brands it sells together with the level and quality of customer service the ability to differentiate signets stores and merchandise from competitors by its branding marketing and advertising programs is an important factor in attracting consumers if these programs are poorly executed or the level of support for them is reduced or the customer loses confidence in any of signets brands for whatever reason it could unfavorably impact sales and earningslongterm changes in consumer attitudes to jewelry could be unfavorable and harm jewelry salesconsumer attitudes to diamonds gold and other precious metals and gemstones also influence the level of signets sales attitudes could be affected by a variety of issues including concern over the source of raw materials the impact of mining and refining of minerals on the environment the local community and the political stability of the producing country labor conditions in the supply chain and the availability of and consumer attitudes to substitute products such as cubic zirconia moissanite and laboratory created diamonds a negative change in consumer attitudes to jewelry could adversely impact sales and earningsthe retail jewelry industry is highly fragmented and competitive aggressive discounting or going out of business sales by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short termthe retail jewelry industry is competitive if signets competitive position deteriorates operating results or financial condition could be adversely affectedaggressive discounting by competitors particularly those holding going out of business sales may adversely impact signets performance in the short term this is particularly the case for easily comparable pieces of jewelry of similar quality sold through stores that are situated near to those that signet operatessignet faces significant competition from independent and regional specialty jewelry retailers that are able to adjust their competitive stance for example on pricing to local market conditions this can put individual signet stores at a competitive disadvantage as signet divisions have a national pricing strategythe inability to rent stores that satisfy managements operational and financial criteria could harm sales as could changes in locations where customers shop signets results are dependent on a number of factors relating to its stores these include the availability of desirable property the demographic characteristics of the area around the store the design and maintenance of the stores the availability of attractive locations within the shopping center that also meet the operational and financial criteria of management the terms of leases and signets relationship with major landlords if signet is unable to rent stores that satisfy its operational and financial criteria or if there is a disruption in its relationship with its major landlords sales could be adversely affected27table of contentsgiven the length of property leases that signet enters into it is dependent upon the continued popularity of particular retail locations as signet tests and develops new types of store locations and designs there is no certainty as to their success the majority of longterm space growth opportunities in the us are in new developments and therefore future store space is in part dependent on the investment by real estate developers in new projects limited new real estate development taking place would make it challenging to identify and secure suitable new store locations the uk jewelry division has a more diverse range of store locations than in the us or canada including some exposure to smaller retail centers which do not justify the investment required to refurbish the site to the current store format consequently the uk jewelry division is gradually closing stores in such locations as leases expire or satisfactory property transactions can be executed however the ability to secure such property transactions is not certainthe rate of new store development is dependent on a number of factors including obtaining suitable real estate the capital resources of signet the availability of appropriate staff and management and the level of the financial return on investment required by managementsignets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders whose behavior may be affected by its management of social ethical and environmental riskssocial ethical and environmental matters influence signets reputation demand for merchandise by consumers the ability to recruit staff relations with suppliers and standing in the financial markets signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders customers shareholders employees and suppliers in recent years stakeholder expectations have increased and signets success and reputation will depend on its ability to meet these higher expectationsinadequacies in and disruption to systems could result in lower sales and increased costs or adversely impact the reporting and control proceduressignet is dependent on the suitability reliability and durability of its systems and procedures including its accounting information technology data protection warehousing and distribution systems if support ceased for a critical externally supplied software package or system management would have to implement an alternative software package or system or begin supporting the software internally disruption to parts of the business could result in lower sales and increased costssecurity breaches and other disruptions to signets information technology infrastructure and databases could interfere with signets operations and could compromise signets and its customers and suppliers information exposing signet to liability which would cause signets business and reputation to suffersignet operates in multiple channels and in the sterling jewelers division maintains its own customer finance operation signet is also increasingly using mobile devices social media and other online activities to connect with customers staff and other stakeholders therefore in the ordinary course of business signet relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including ecommerce sales supply chain merchandise distribution customer invoicing and collection of payments signet uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally signet collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of signets customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to signets business operations and strategy despite security measures and business

the determination of fair value of each reporting unit there is a risk that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of

average value of its assets consists of assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income for the purposes of these rules a nonus corporation is considered to hold and receive directly its proportionate share of the assets and income of any other corporation of whose shares it owns at least 25 by value consequently the parent companys classification under the pfic rules will depend primarily upon the composition of its assets and incomeif the parent company is characterized as a pfic us holders would suffer adverse tax consequences and us federal income tax consequences different from those described above may apply these consequences may include having gains realized on the disposition of common shares treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain distributions and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of common shares the parent company believes that it is not a pfic and that it will not be a pfic for the foreseeable future however since the tests for pfic status depend upon facts not entirely within the parent companys control such as the amounts and types of its income and values of its assets no assurance can be provided that the parent company will not become a pfic us holders of pfic shares are required to file irs form 8621 annually us holders should consult

drivers of the net sterling jewelers divisions bad debt to total divisional sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary consumer credit scores used when granting customer finance the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances sterling jewelers division credit sales as a percentage of total sterling jewelers division sales and the rate of change in the level of unemployment in the us economy selling general and administrative expenseselling general and administrative expense primarily includes store staff and store administrative costs as well as advertising and promotional costs it also includes field support center expenses such as information technology credit finance ecommerce and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statementsthe primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees employed and the level of compensation taxes and other benefits paid management varies on a store by store basis the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store nonstore staffing levels are less variable a significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales and operating profitthe level of advertising expenditure can vary the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by managements judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing mediaother operating incomeother operating income is predominantly interest income arising from inhouse customer finance provided to the customers of the sterling jewelers division its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged the credit program selected by the customer and the level of outstanding balances the level of outstanding balances is dependent on the sales of the sterling jewelers division the proportion of sales that use the inhouse customer finance and the monthly collection rateoperating incometo maintain current levels of operating income signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin any increase in operating costs the impact of any immature selling space and any adverse changes in other operating income same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income when foreseen such as through the sterling jewelers divisions cost saving measures implemented in fiscal 2010 signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions the acquisition of companies with operating margins lower than that of signet may cause an overall lower operating margin for signet the impact on operating income of a sharp unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance can be significant this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business in the medium term there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level but the time it takes varies depending on the type of cost an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter it is even more difficult to reduce base lease costs in the short or medium term as leases in us malls are typically for one to ten years jared sites for 1520 years and in the uk for a minimum of five years 49table of contentsresults of

finance program metrics including average monthly collection rate and the mix of finance offer participationchanges to accrued expenses including variable compensation anddeferred revenue reflective of the performance of extended service plan salesother sources of cash include borrowings issuance of common shares for cash and proceeds from the securitization facility relating to signets sterling jewelers accounts receivable63table of contentsnet cash provided by operating activities signet derives most of its operating cash from net income through the sale of jewelry as a retail business signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by signet or the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card partially offsetting cash via sales are operating expenses signets largest operating expenses are payroll and related payroll benefits working capitalchanges to accounts receivable are driven by the sterling jewelers division inhouse credit program if a customer makes use of financing provided by the sterling jewelers division the cash is received over a period of time in fiscal 2015 605 of the sterling jewelers divisions sales were made using customer financing provided by signet as compared to 577 in fiscal 2014 the average monthly collection rate from the sterling jewelers customer inhouse finance receivables was 119 as compared to 121 in fiscal 2014 changes in credit participation and the collection rate impact the level of receivableschanges to accounts payable are primarily driven by the amount of merchandise purchased the mix of merchandise purchased and the relevant payment terms signet typically pays for merchandise within 30 days of receipt due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately 12 months before it is sold signets working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the british pound and canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to late november the peak level of working capital is typically 150 million above the typical january to august level and can be accentuated by new store openings the working capital position then reverses over the holiday seasonthe change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales other factors which drive changes to inventory include changes in sourcing practices commodity costs foreign exchange and merchandise mix to further enhance product selection test new jewelry designs and working capital levels signet utilizes consignment inventory the majority of consignment inventory is held in the us which at january 31 2015 amounted to 4346 million as compared to 3126 million at february 1 2014 the principal terms of the consignment agreements which can generally be terminated by either party are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties when signet sells consignment inventory it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies item 8 signets working capital is also impacted by movements in deferred revenue associated with the sales of extended service plans sold in sterling jewelers and zale divisions movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of divisional sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales therefore if sales increase working capital would be expected to increase similarly a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capitalsignets largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits these are typically paid on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis with annual bonus payments also being made operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the sterling jewelers and zale divisions and on a quarterly basis by the uk jewelry division payment for advertising on television radio or in newspapers is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears other expenses none of which are material have various payment termsinvestment in new space requires significant investment in working capital as well as fixed capital investment due to the inventory turn and the additional investment required to fund sales in the sterling jewelers utilizing inhouse customer finance of the total investment required to open a new store in the us between 50 and 60 is typically accounted for by working capital new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact fiscal 2015 cash flow resultsin fiscal 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 2830 million as compared to 2355 million in fiscal 2014 an increase of 475 million net income increased by 133 million to 3813 million as compared to 3680 million in fiscal 2014 with depreciation and amortization increasing by 395 million to 1497 million as compared to 1102 million in fiscal 2014 the primary drivers of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 were as followscash used in accounts receivable increased to 1946 million compared to 1683 million in fiscal 2014 reflecting higher credit sales a higher rate of inhouse customer finance a slightly lower collection rate and higher mix of customers selecting interest bearing accounts which do not require a down payment at onsetcash used for purchases of inventory increased to 1216 million compared to 984 million in fiscal 2014 the change in inventory cash flows was primarily attributed to new store growth expansion of bridal and branded merchandise and increased rough diamond inventory associated with managements diamond sourcing initiative offsetting these increases were management actions to improve 64table of contentsinventory turns cash provided by accounts payable increased to 237 million compared to 32 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by timing of payments on higher inventory levels in fiscal 2015 total inventory as of january 31 2015 was 24390 million compared to 14880 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in inventory is primarily attributed to the zale acquisition which increased inventory by 9176 million the remainder of the increase was driven in part by expansion of bridal and branded merchandise and loose diamonds in the sterling jewelers division partially offset by a decline in inventory in uk jewelry division due primarily to foreign currency exchange rates cash used by other current assets increased to 355 million compared to 41 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to prepaid rent associated with properties added to our store portfolio in connection with the zale acquisition cash provided by accrued expenses and other liabilities increased to 648 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 86 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was driven primarily by increased debtrelated accrued expenses including interest as well as increased payroll related costs in part due to the zale acquisition cash flow associated with deferred revenue increased 1023 million in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 508 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by a combination of higher extended warranty sales in sterling jewelers as well as the deferral of warranty sales associated with zale division income taxes payable decreased by 16 million compared to an increase of 79 million in fiscal 2014 due to higher estimated tax payments made in fiscal 2015in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 accounts receivable increased by 2764 million

and uk distribution facilitieswhen evaluating new store investment management uses an investment hurdle rate of a 20 internal rate of return on a pretax basis over a five year period assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years capital expenditure accounts for about 45 of the investment in a new store in the sterling jewelers division the balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing signet typically carries out a major refurbishment of its stores every 10 years but does have some discretion as to the timing of such expenditure a major store refurbishment is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store minor store redecorations are typically carried out every five years in addition to major store refurbishments signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full refurbishment this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal where possible the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunitiesin fiscal 2015 net cash used in investing activities

for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those amounts 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether

mitigate certain risk exposures related to changes in commodity costs and foreign exchange rates derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities with an offset to net income or other comprehensive income oci depending on whether the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge if a derivative instrument meets certain criteria it may be designated as a cash flow hedge on the date it is entered into for cash flow hedge transactions the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized directly in equity as a component of aoci and is recognized in the consolidated income statements in the same periods and on the same financial statement line in which the hedged item affects net income amounts excluded from the effectiveness calculation and any ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the consolidated income statements in addition gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the normal course of business the company may terminate cash flow hedges prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction for cash flow hedges terminated prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction management monitors the probability of the associated forecasted cash flow transactions to assess whether any gain or loss recorded in aoci should be immediately recognized in net income cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities  employee benefits signet operates a defined benefit pension plan in the uk the uk plan which ceased to admit new employees effective april 2004 the uk plan provides benefits to participating eligible employees beginning in fiscal 2014 a change to the benefit structure was implemented and members benefits that accumulate after that date are now based upon career average salaries whereas previously all benefits were based on salaries at retirement the uk plans assets are held by the uk plan  the net periodic pension cost of the uk plan is measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee attrition gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions if such gains or losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of the employees the net periodic pension cost is charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement  the funded status of the uk plan is recognized on the balance sheet and is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation measured at the balance sheet date gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise and not included as components of net 71table of contentsperiodic pension cost are recognized net of tax in oci the funded status of the

of signets accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 1 of item 8 signets current portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and forward contracts for the purchase of gold an analysis quantifying the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by signet to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates is detailed in note 16 of item 8foreign currency exchange rate riskapproximately 89 of signets total assets were held in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar at january 31 2015 and generated approximately 83 of its sales and 91 of its operating income in us dollars in fiscal 2015 nearly all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in uk british pounds and canadian dollarsin translating the results of the uk jewelry division and the canadian subsidiary of the zale jewelry segment signets results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and both the british pound and canadian dollar any depreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the british pound or canadian dollar could increase reported revenues and operating profit and any appreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the british pound or canadian dollar could decrease reported revenues and operating profit the uk jewelry division buys certain products and materials on international markets that are priced in us dollars and therefore has an exposure to exchange rates on the cost of goods sold signet uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of this exposure within treasury guidelines approved by the boardsignet holds a fluctuating amount of british pounds reflecting the cash generating characteristics of the uk jewelry division signets objective is to minimize net foreign exchange exposure to the income statement on british pound denominated items through managing this level of cash british pound denominated intercompany balances and us dollar to british pound swaps in order to manage the foreign exchange exposure and minimize the level of british pound cash held by signet the british pound denominated subsidiaries pay dividends regularly to their immediate holding companies and excess british pounds are sold in exchange for us dollarscommodity price risksignets results are subject to fluctuations in the cost of diamonds gold and certain other precious metals which are key raw material components of the products sold by

or net zerocost collar arrangements within treasury guidelines approved by the board of directorsinterest rate risksignets interest income or expense is exposed to volatility in interest rates this exposure is driven by both the currency denomination of the cash or debt the mix of fixed and floating rate debt used the type of cash investments and the total amount of cash and debt outstanding as of january 31 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately 97 millionsensitivity analysismanagement has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of signets financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates as shown in the table below72table of contentsfair value changes arising fromin millionsfair value january 31 2015 10 basis point increase in interest rates 10 depreciation of  against  10 depreciation of gold prices fair value february 1 2014foreign exchange contracts11  23  19commodity contracts63   104 the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis quantify the impact of market risk assuming that certain adverse market conditions specified in the table above occur they are not forwardlooking estimates of market risk actual results in the future are likely to differ materially from those projected due to changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and actual developments in the global financial marketsany changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and developments in the global financial markets may cause fluctuations in interest rates exchange rates and precious metal prices to exceed the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table above the sensitivity scenarios are intended to allow an expected risk measure to be applied to the scenarios as opposed to the scenarios themselves being an indicator of the maximum expected riskthe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on market value equivalents at period end taking into account the current interest rate environment current foreign currency forward rates or current commodity forward ratesthe estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against british pound from the levels applicable at january 31 2015 with all other variables remaining

and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the undiscounted cash flow is less than the assets carrying amount the impairment charge recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair

between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the second quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount the company estimates the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compares that value with its carrying amount and records an impairment charge

flow hedge transactions the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized directly in equity as a component of aoci and is recognized in the consolidated income statements in the same periods and on the same financial statement line in which the hedged item affects net income amounts excluded from the effectiveness calculation and any ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the consolidated income statements in addition gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the normal course of business the company may terminate cash flow hedges prior to the occurrence of the
