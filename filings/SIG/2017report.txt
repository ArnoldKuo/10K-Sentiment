pillars included below define our key priorities and growth focus areasgrow in the midmarketbest in bridalwin in fashion and giftingdigital first and data drivenpeople purpose and passiongrowing in the midmarket drives our competitive strengths focused on merchandising marketing omnichannel and productivity initiatives we define the midmarket jewelry sector based on the value of products that consumers purchase we consider this market to be defined by jewelry purchases with price points ranging from 50 to 10000 which essentially excludes costume and luxury jewelry categories the vast majority of signets sales over 95 are in this range of price points this subset of the total us jewelry market is approximately 41 billion or about half the total us market in pursuit of this strategic pillar we continuously review our us national store brands performance and have concluded that our customer population has several distinct shopping and purchasing characteristics or customer identities consequently we attempt to grow our share of the midmarket by differentiating customers based on attitudes and behaviors versus demographic information this approach to customer segmentation results in distinct customer identitiesthe sentimentalist  a seeker of highquality timeless jewelry which invokes sentimental valuethe gifter  a customer that is not highly knowledgeable of jewelry but purchases for others the influencer  a customer that uses jewelry to show status and is knowledgeable of brands the influencer is a customer focused on both selfpurchase and gifting the stylish shopper  a customer that wears jewelry often and considers it an essential aspect of fashionthe practical shopper  a customer that focuses on inexpensive everyday jewelry4table of

a competitive advantage through the enabling of incremental profitable sales that would not occur without a consumer financing program several factors inherent in the us jewelry business support the circumstances through which signet is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental business through its consumer financing program these factors include a high average transaction value a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise primarily in the bridal category and the minimum scale necessary to administer credit programs efficiently in addition our credit program provides other benefits to our business overall including complementing our best in bridal strategy in that 50 of merchandise sales are bridal and 75 of sterling jewelers division bridal sales utilize our credit as form of tenderproviding a database of regular guests and spending habitsestablishing collection policies designed to minimize risk and maximize future sales as opposed to a focus on maximizing earnings from outstanding balancesfor our inhouse credit program as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 55 and 53 respectively of balances due were from customers who were acquired as users of our credit program more than 12 months prior to their most recent purchase our inhouse consumer financing program has been centralized since 1990 and is fully integrated into the management of the sterling jewelers division it is not a separate operating division nor does it report separate results all assets and liabilities relating to consumer financing are shown on the balance sheet and there are no associated offbalance sheet arrangements in addition to interestbearing transactions that involve the use of inhouse customer finance a portion of credit sales are made using interestfree financing for one year and at a reduced rate for up to 36 months in select offers subject to certain conditions in most us states guests also are offered optional thirdparty credit insuranceas part of our operational strategy discussed previously management continues to review strategic options related to its inhouse consumer financing programs which include optimizing our current inhouse program or utilizing a fulloutsourced modelunderwritingthe majority of credit applications originate in one of our retail locations and are approved or denied automatically based on proprietary origination models origination and purchase authorization strategies are designed by a dedicated risk management team which is separate and distinct from our retail sales organization ensuring that financing decisions are not influenced by sales driven objectives our underwriting process considers one or more of the following elements credit bureau information income and address verification current income and debt levels we have developed and refined proprietary statistical models that provide standardized credit decisions and drive the optimization of credit limit assignment down payment requirements and more significant debt service requirements as compared to general consumer lending standards for certain credit applicants that may have past credit problems or lack credit history we use stricter underwriting criteria these additional requirements may include items such as verification of employment and minimum down payment levels part of our ability to control delinquency and net chargeoffs is based on the level of required down payments tailored credit limits and more significant debt service requirements as mentioned above underwriting risk tolerance has not been altered in the past 10 years several factors can influence portfolio risk outside of the initial origination and subsequent authorization decisions including macroeconomic conditions regulatory environment operational system stability and strategy execution store execution and the ability of marketing and prospecting activities to attract a consistent risk weighted mix of new applicants to the receivable the scores of fair isaac corporation fico a widelyused financial metric for assessing a persons credit rating are used to benchmark portfolio and origination risk over time ten to twenty point ranges tend to be grouped together to form tiers of risk and scores can range from a low of 0 to over 800 the following aggregate fico metrics for the portfolio

662 663credit monitoring and collectionsour objective is to facilitate the sale of jewelry and to collect the outstanding credit balance as quickly as possible minimizing risk and enabling the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using their credit facility on average our receivable portfolio turns every 910 months we closely monitor the credit portfolio to identify delinquent accounts early and dedicate resources to contacting customers concerning past due accounts when they are as few as 5 days in arrears collectors are focused on a quality customer experience using riskbased calling and strategic account segmentation15table of contentsthe quality of our credit loan portfolio at any time reflects among other factors 1 the creditworthiness of our customers 2 general economic conditions 3 the success of our account management and collection activities and 4 a variety of variables that change over time such as the proportion of new versus seasoned accounts or changes in the relative growth rate in sales between our various retail brands or formats cash flows associated with the granting of credit to guests of the individual store are included in the projections used when considering store investment proposalsportfolio agingsince inception of its inhouse financing signet measures delinquency and establishes loss allowances using a form of the recency method this form of the recency method relies upon qualifying payments determined by management to measure delinquency in general an account will not remain current unless a qualifying payment is received a customer is aged to the next delinquency level if they fail to make a qualifying payment by their monthly aging a customers account ages each month five days after their due date listed on their statement allowing for a grace period before collection efforts begin a qualifying payment can be no less than 75 of the scheduled payment increasing with the delinquency level if an account holder is two payments behind then they must make a full minimum payment to return to current status if an account holder is three payments behind then they must make three full payments before returning to a current status if an account holder is more than three payments behind then the entire past due amount is required to return to a current status establishing qualifying payment methods in accounting for delinquencies is appropriate considering the high minimum payments that are required of customers the weighted average minimum payment required as a percentage of the outstanding balance was 8 at year end fiscal 2017 the minimum payment does not decline as the balance declines these two facts combined higher scheduled payment requirement and no decline in payment requirement as balance decreases allow signet to collect on the receivable significantly faster than other retailbank card accounts which require a 5 or less minimum payment reducing risk and more quickly freeing up customer open to buy for additional purchases of all payments received in fiscal 2017 97 were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment which is in line with experience during fiscal 2016see note 1 of item 8 for additional information regarding qualifying paymentsallowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of goods sold in the income statement the allowance is calculated using a model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates an allowance for amounts 90 days aged and under on a recency basis is established based on historical loss experience and payment performance information a 100 allowance is made for any amount aged more than 90 days on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy an account is 90 days aged on a recency basis when there has not been a qualifying payment made within 90 days of the billing date the net bad debt expensed on the income statement is equal to the sum of the total change in the allowance for uncollectible accounts and the total amount of charged off balances less any recoveries for accounts previously charged off the allowance calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analysis is required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfoliowe deem accounts to be uncollectible and charge off when the account is both more than 120 days aged on a recency basis and 240 days aged on a contractual basis at the end of a month over the last 12 months we have recovered 16 of chargedoff amounts through our collection activities and the sale of previously charged off accounts we track our chargeoffs both gross before recoveries and net after

factorsa decline in consumer spending may unfavorably impact signets future sales and earningsjewelry purchases are discretionary and are dependent on consumers perceptions of general economic conditions particularly as jewelry is often perceived to be a luxury purchase adverse changes in the economy and periods when discretionary spending by consumers may be under pressure could unfavorably impact sales and earnings we may respond by increasing discounts or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and operating resultsthe success of signets operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers consumer confidence level of customer traffic in shopping malls and other retail centers employment the level of consumers disposable income business conditions interest rates consumer debt and asset values availability of credit and levels of taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operateas 10 of signets sales are accounted for by its uk jewelry division economic conditions in the eurozone have a significant impact on the uk economy even though the uk is not a member of the eurozone therefore developments in the eurozone could adversely impact trading in the uk jewelry division as well as adversely impact the us economy global economic conditions and regulatory changes following the united kingdoms announced intention to exit from the european union could adversely impact signets business and results of operations located in or closely associated with the united kingdomin june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union often referred to as brexit in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process this will be either accompanied or followed by negotiations between the european union and the united kingdom concerning the future relations between the parties nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union this includes uncertainty with respect to the laws and regulations including regulations applicable to signets business that will apply in the united kingdom in the event of a withdrawal the referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider a referendum on withdrawal from the european union for their territory these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could adversely impact global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets any of these factors could depress economic activity which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations especially those located in or closely associated with the united kingdom brexit could lead to longterm volatility in the currency markets and there could be longterm detrimental effects on the value of the british pound brexit could also impact other currencies signet uses foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to currency exchange rate risks the results of the brexit referendum could increase signets exposure to foreign currency rate exchange risks and reduce its ability to effectively use certain derivative instruments as a way to hedge risksany deterioration in consumers financial position or changes to the regulatory requirements regarding the granting of credit to customers could adversely impact the companys sales earnings and the collectability of accounts receivable more than half of signets sales in the us and canada utilize its inhouse or thirdparty customer financing programs and an additional 35 of purchases are made using third party bank cards any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increase in consumer debt levels may inhibit consumers use of credit and decrease consumers ability to satisfy signets requirement for access to customer finance and could in turn have an adverse effect on the companys sales furthermore any downturn in general or local economic conditions in particular an increase in unemployment in the markets in which the signet operates may adversely affect its collection of outstanding accounts receivable its net bad debt charge and hence earningsadditionally signets ability to extend credit to customers and the terms on which it is achieved depends on many factors including compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the us and canada any of which may change from time to time and such changes could adversely affect sales and income in addition other restrictions arising from applicable law could cause limitations in credit terms currently offered or a reduction in the level of credit granted by the company or by third parties and this could adversely impact sales income or cash flowthe us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the doddfrank act created a bureau of consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking and supervisory authority for a wide range of consumer financial services including signets customer financing programs the bureaus authority became effective in july 2011 any new regulatory initiatives by the bureau could impose additional costs andor restrictions on credit practices of the sterling jewelers and zale divisions which could adversely affect their ability to conduct its businesssignets share price may be volatilesignets share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in the actual or anticipated results and financial conditions of signet and other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies24table of contentssignet provides public guidance on its expected operating and financial results for future periods although signet believes that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to its stockholders and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements signets actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the provided guidance or the expectations of our investors and analysts especially in times of economic uncertainty in the past when the company has reduced its previously provided guidance the market price of signets common stock has declined if in the future signets operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of our investors and analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may declinein addition signet may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future if the analysts that regularly follow the companys stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the companys stock price could decline signets sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basissignets business is highly seasonal with a significant proportion of its sales and operating profit generated during its fourth quarter which includes the holiday season management expects to continue to experience a seasonal fluctuation in its sales and earnings therefore there is limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in its operations and strategies in other quarters or to recover from any extensive disruption for example due to sudden adverse changes in consumer confidence inclement weather conditions having an impact on a significant number of stores in the last few days immediately before christmas day or disruption to warehousing and store replenishment systems a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any fiscal year would therefore be expected to have a material adverse effect on the annual results of operations disruption at lesser peaks in sales at valentines day and mothers day would be expected to impact the results to a lesser extent additionally in anticipation of increased sales activity in the holiday season signet incurs certain significant incremental expenses prior to and during peak selling seasons including advertising and costs associated with hiring a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforcedeterioration in the companys capital structure or financial performance could result in constraints on capital or financial covenant breaches in addition a portion of the companys debt is variable rate and volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultswhile signet has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its operating requirements the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in signets capital structure or the quality and stability of earnings could result in a downgrade of signets credit rating any negative ratings actions could also constrain the capital available to the company could limit the companys access to funding for its operations funding dividends and share repurchases and increase the companys financing costs changes in general credit market conditions could also affect signets ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally as a result of the companys exposure to variable interest rate debt volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultssignets borrowing agreements include various financial covenants and operating restrictions a material deterioration in its financial performance could result in a covenant being breached if signet were to breach or believed it was going to breach a financial covenant it would have to renegotiate its terms with current lenders or find alternative sources of financing if current lenders required cancellation of facilities or early repaymentfluctuations in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact the companys results of operations and financial conditionsignet publishes its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars at january 28 2017 signet held approximately 91 of its total assets in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar and generated approximately 86 of its sales and 94 of its operating income in us dollars for the fiscal year then ended all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in uk british pounds and canadian dollars therefore the companys results of operations and balance sheet are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and both the british pound and canadian dollar accordingly any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would decrease reported sales and operating incomethe monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated based on the daily exchange rates experienced by the uk jewelry division and the canadian subsidiaries of the zale division in the fiscal monthwhere british pounds or canadian dollars are held or used to fund the cash flow requirements of the business any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalentsin addition the prices of certain materials and products bought on the international markets by signet are denominated in foreign currencies as a result signet and its subsidiaries have exposures to exchange rate fluctuations on its cost of goods sold as well as volatility of input prices if foreign manufacturers and suppliers are impacted by exchange rate fluctuations25table of contentsfluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities particularly polished diamonds and gold which account for the majority of signets merchandise costs could adversely impact its earnings and cash availabilitythe jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones in particular diamonds accounted for about 45 and gold about 14 of signets merchandise costs in fiscal 2017in fiscal 2017 prices for the assortment of polished diamonds utilized by signet decreased slightly compared to prior year industry forecasts indicate that over the medium and longer term the demand for diamonds will probably increase faster than the growth in supply particularly as a result of growing demand in countries such as china and india therefore the cost of diamonds is anticipated to rise over time although fluctuations in price are likely to continue to occur the mining production and inventory policies followed by major producers of rough diamonds can have a significant impact on diamond prices as can the inventory and buying patterns of jewelry retailers and other parties in the supply chainwhile jewelry manufacturing is the major final demand for gold management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly impacted by investment transactions which have resulted in significant volatility in the gold price in recent years signets cost of merchandise and potentially its earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly escalatethe availability of diamonds is significantly influenced by the political situation in diamond producing countries and by the kimberley process an intergovernmental agreement for the international trading of rough diamonds until acceptable alternative sources of diamonds can be developed any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from significant producing countries or to the trading in rough and polished diamonds which could occur as a result of disruption to the kimberley process could adversely affect signet as well as the retail jewelry market as a whole in addition the current kimberley process decision making procedure is dependent on reaching a consensus among member governments which can result in the protracted resolution of issues and there is little expectation of significant reform over the longterm the impact of this review process on the supply of diamonds and consumers perception of the diamond supply chain is unknown in addition to the kimberley process the supply of diamonds to the us is also impacted by certain governmental trade sanctions imposed on zimbabwethe possibility of constraints in the supply of diamonds of a size and quality signet requires to meet its merchandising requirements may result in changes in signets supply chain practices for example its rough sourcing initiative in addition signet may from time to time choose to hold more inventory purchase raw materials at an earlier stage in the supply chain or enter into commercial agreements of a nature that it currently does not use such actions could require the investment of cash andor additional management skills such actions may not result in the expected returns and other projected benefits anticipated by managementan inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability historically jewelry retailers have been able over time to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs however in general particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices as signet uses an average cost inventory methodology volatility in its commodity costs may also result in a time lag before cost increases are reflected in retail prices there is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur in addition any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customerin august 2012 the sec pursuant to the doddfrank act issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the gold supply chain is complex and while management believes that the rules currently cover less than 1 of annual worldwide gold production based upon recent estimates the final rules require signet and other affected companies that file with the sec to make specified country of origin inquiries of our suppliers and otherwise to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin and certain other information relating to any of the statutorily designated minerals gold tin tantalum and tungsten that are used in products sold by signet in the us and elsewhere on may 27 2016 signet filed with the sec its form specialized disclosure sd and accompanying conflict minerals report in accordance with the secs rules which together describe our country of origin inquiries and due diligence measures relating to the source and chain of custody of those designated minerals signet deemed necessary to the functionality or production of our products the results of those activities and our related determinations with respect to the calendar year ended december 31 2015there may be reputational risks associated with the potential negative response of our customers and other stakeholders to future disclosures by signet in the event that due to the complexity of the global supply chain signet is unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the relevant metals also if future responses to verification requests by suppliers of any of the covered minerals used in our products are inadequate or adverse signets ability to obtain merchandise may be impaired and our compliance costs may increase the final rules also cover tungsten and tin which are contained in a small proportion of items that are sold by signet it is possible that other minerals such as diamonds could be subject to similar rulesprice increases may have an adverse impact on signets performanceif significant price increases are implemented by any division or across a wide range of merchandise the impact on earnings will depend on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products in the same geographic area and the response by customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower sales and adversely impact earnings26table of contentssignets competitors are specialty jewelry retailers as well as other jewelry retailers including department stores mass merchandisers discount stores apparel and accessory fashion stores brand retailers shopping clubs home shopping television channels direct home sellers online retailers and auction sites in addition other retail categories and other forms of expenditure such as electronics and travel also compete for consumers discretionary expenditure particularly during the holiday gift giving season therefore the price of jewelry relative to other products influences the proportion of consumers expenditure that is spent on jewelry if the relative price of jewelry increases signets sales and earnings may declinethe companys ability to satisfy the accounting requirements for hedge accounting or the default or insolvency of a counterparty to a hedging contract could adversely impact resultssignet hedges a portion of its purchases of gold for both its sterling jewelers and uk jewelry divisions and hedges the us dollar requirements of its uk jewelry division the failure to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate accounting requirements or a default or insolvency of a counterparty to a contract could increase the volatility of results and may impact the timing of recognition of gains and losses in the income statementthe companys inability to obtain merchandise that customers wish to purchase particularly ahead of and during the fourth quarter could adversely impact salesthe abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the fourth quarter could result in a material adverse effect on signets businessalso if management misjudges expected customer demand or fails to identify changes in customer demand andor its supply chain does not respond in a timely manner it could adversely impact signets results by causing either a shortage of merchandise or an accumulation of excess inventorysignet benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results management holds regular reviews with major suppliers signets most significant supplier accounts for 55 of merchandise government requirements regarding sources of commodities such as those required by the doddfrank act could result in signet choosing to terminate relationships with suppliers in the future due to a change in a suppliers sourcing practices or signets compliance with laws and internal policiesluxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies the right to sell their ranges on a storebystore basis the watch brands sold by ernest jones and to a lesser extent jared help attract customers and build sales in all categories therefore an inability to obtain or retain watch agencies for a location could harm the performance of that particular store in the case of ernest jones the inability to gain additional prestige watch agencies is an important factor in and may reduce the likelihood of opening new stores which could adversely impact sales growththe growth in importance of branded merchandise within the jewelry market may adversely impact signets sales and earnings if it is unable to obtain supplies of branded merchandise that the customer wishes to purchase in addition if signet loses the distribution rights to an important branded jewelry range it could adversely impact sales and earningssignet has had success in recent years in the development of branded merchandise that is exclusive to its stores if signet is not able to further develop such branded merchandise or is unable to successfully develop further such initiatives it may adversely impact sales and earningsthe companys ability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsmanagement regards the customer experience as an essential element in the success of its business competition for suitable individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs therefore an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsloss of confidence by consumers in signets brand names poor execution of marketing programs and reduced marketing expenditure could have a detrimental impact on salesprimary factors in determining customer buying decisions in the jewelry sector include customer confidence in the retailer and in the brands it sells together with the level and quality of customer service the ability to differentiate signets stores and merchandise from competitors by its branding marketing and advertising programs is an important factor in attracting consumers if these programs are poorly executed the level of support for them is reduced or the customer loses confidence in any of signets brands for whatever reason it could unfavorably impact sales and earningslongterm changes in consumer attitudes to jewelry could be unfavorable and harm jewelry salesconsumer attitudes to diamonds gold and other precious metals and gemstones also influence the level of signets sales attitudes could be affected by a variety of issues including concern over the source of raw materials the impact of mining and refining of minerals on the environment the local community and the political stability of the producing country labor conditions in the supply chain and the availability of and consumer attitudes to substitute products such as cubic zirconia moissanite and laboratorycreated diamonds a negative change in consumer attitudes to jewelry could adversely impact sales and earnings27table of contentsthe retail jewelry industry is highly fragmented and competitive the retail jewelry industry is competitive if signets competitive position deteriorates operating results or financial condition could be adversely affectedaggressive discounting by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short term this is particularly the case for easily comparable pieces of jewelry of similar quality sold through stores that are situated near to those that signet operatessignet faces significant competition from independent and regional specialty jewelry retailers that are able to adjust their competitive stance for example on pricing to local market conditions this can put individual signet stores at a competitive disadvantage as signet divisions have a national pricing strategythe companys inability to rent stores that satisfy managements operational and financial criteria could adversely impact sales as could changes in locations where customers shop signets results are dependent on a number of factors relating to its stores these include the availability of desirable property the demographic characteristics of the area around the store the design and maintenance of the stores the availability of attractive locations within the shopping center that also meet the operational and financial criteria of management the terms of leases and signets relationship with major landlords if signet is unable to rent stores that satisfy its operational and financial criteria or if there is a disruption in its relationship with its major landlords sales could be adversely affectedgiven the length of property leases that signet enters into it is dependent upon the continued popularity of particular retail locations as signet tests and develops new types of store locations and designs there is no certainty as to their success the majority of longterm space growth opportunities in the us are in new developments and therefore future store space is in part dependent on the investment by real estate developers in new projects limited new real estate development taking place would make it challenging to identify and secure suitable new store locations the uk jewelry division has a more diverse range of store locations than in the us or canada including some exposure to smaller retail centers which do not justify the investment required to refurbish the site to the current store format consequently the uk jewelry division is gradually closing stores in such locations as leases expire or satisfactory property transactions can be executed however the ability to secure such property transactions is not certainthe rate of new store development is dependent on a number of factors including obtaining suitable real estate the capital resources of signet the availability of appropriate staff and management and the level of the financial return on investment required by managementsignets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders whose behavior may be affected by its management of social ethical and environmental riskssocial ethical and environmental matters influence signets reputation demand for merchandise by consumers the ability to recruit staff relations with suppliers and standing in the financial markets signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders customers shareholders employees and suppliers in recent years stakeholder expectations have increased and signets success and reputation will depend on its ability to meet these higher expectations signets success also depends upon its reputation for integrity in sourcing its merchandise which if adversely affected could impact consumer sentiment and willingness to purchase signets merchandiseinadequacies in and disruption to systems could result in lower

increased costssignet is in the process of substantially modifying our enterprise resource planning systems which involves updating or replacing legacy systems with successor systems over the course of several years these system changes and upgrades can require significant capital investments and dedication of resources while signet follows a disciplined methodology when evaluating and making such changes there can be no assurances that the company will successfully implement such changes that such changes will occur without disruptions to its operations or that the new or upgraded systems

signet relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including ecommerce sales supply chain merchandise distribution customer invoicing and collection of payments signet uses information technology systems to record

subsidiaries operate or are incorporated tax laws treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation the companys income tax expense is based upon interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time such expense was incurred if these tax laws treaties or regulations were to change or any tax authority were to successfully challenge our assessment of the effects of such laws treaties and regulations in any country this could result in a higher effective tax rate on the companys taxable earnings which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operationsin addition the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has published an action plan seeking multilateral cooperation to reform the taxation of multinational companies countries already have begun to implement some of these action items and likely will continue to adopt more of them over the next several years this may result in unilateral or uncoordinated local country application of the action items any such inconsistencies in the tax laws of countries where the company operates or is incorporated may lead to increased uncertainty with respect to tax positions or otherwise increase the potential for double taxation proposals for us tax reform also potentially could have a significant adverse effect on us in addition the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax legislation or rulings provide preferential tax treatment in violation of european union state aid rules any impacts of these actions could increase the companys tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial conditionthe

the minister of finances assurance the parent company cannot be certain that it will not be subject to bermuda tax after march 31 2035 in the event the parent company were to become subject to any bermuda tax after such date it could have a material adverse effect on the parent companys results of operations and financial conditionlikewise signets nonus subsidiaries operate in a manner that

shrinkage and related payrollas the classification of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have inhouse customer finance programs signets gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailersfactors that influence gross margin include pricing changes in merchandise costs principally diamonds changes in nonmerchandise components of cost of sales as described above changes in sales mix foreign exchange gold and currency hedges and the economics of services such as repairs and extended service plans the price of diamonds varies depending on their size cut color and clarity at times signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to the us dollar exchange rate but it is not able to do so for diamonds for gold and currencies the hedging period can extend to 24 months although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of 12 monthsthe percentage mix of the merchandise cost component of cost of sales based on us dollars is as follows  sterling jewelers division zale division uk jewelry

inventory methodology and as jewelry inventory turns slowly the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes time to be fully reflected in the gross margin signets inventory turns faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters therefore changes in the cost of merchandise is more impactful on the gross margin in that quarter furthermore signets hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin an increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact

advertising and promotional costs it also includes field support center expenses such as information technology credit finance ecommerce and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statementsthe primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees and the level of compensation taxes and other benefits paid management varies on a store by store basis the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store nonstore staffing levels are less variable a significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales and operating profitthe level of advertising expenditure can vary the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by managements judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media50table of

income signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin any increase in operating costs and any adverse changes in other operating income same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income when foreseen signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses the acquisition of zale diluted operating margin for signet but through the execution of synergies

preferred shares for cash and proceeds from the securitization facility relating to signets sterling jewelers finance receivablesnet cash provided by operating activities signet derives most of its operating cash from net income through the sale of jewelry as a retail business signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by signet or the relevant bank if the payment is made by thirdparty credit or debit card partially offsetting cash receipts via sales are payments of operating expenses signets largest operating expenses are cost of inventory along with payroll and payrollrelated benefits working capitalchanges to accounts receivable are driven by the sterling jewelers division inhouse credit program if a customer makes use of financing provided by the sterling jewelers division the cash is received over time based on terms of the agreement in fiscal 2017 620 of the sterling jewelers divisions sales were made using customer financing provided by signet as compared to 615 in fiscal 2016 the average monthly collection rate from the sterling jewelers customer inhouse finance receivables was 110 as compared to 115 in fiscal 2016 changes in credit participation and the collection rate impact the level of receivables changes to accounts payable are primarily driven by the timing and amount of merchandise purchased the mix of merchandise purchased and the relevant payment terms signet typically pays for merchandise within 30 days of receipt due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry it is usual for inventory to turnover on average once approximately every 12 months signets working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the british pound and canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to latenovember the peak level of working capital is typically 100 million to 150 million above the typical january to august level and can be accentuated by new store openings the working capital position then reverses over the holiday season68table of contentsthe change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales other factors which drive changes to inventory include changes in sourcing practices commodity costs foreign exchange and merchandise mix to further enhance product selection test new jewelry designs and working capital levels signet enters into consignment arrangements for merchandise the majority of inventory held on consignment is in the us which at january 28 2017 amounted to 5740 million as compared to 4419 million at january 30 2016 the principal terms of the consignment agreements which can generally be terminated by either party are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties when signet sells consignment inventory it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies item 8 signets working capital is also impacted by movements in deferred revenue associated with the sales of extended service plans sold in sterling jewelers and zale divisions movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of divisional sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales therefore if sales increase working capital would be expected to increase similarly a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capitalsignets largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits these are typically paid on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis with annual bonus payments also being made operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the sterling jewelers and zale divisions and on a quarterly basis by the uk jewelry division payment for advertising on television radio or in print is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears other expenses none of which are material have various payment termsinvestment in new space requires significant investment in working capital as well as fixed capital investment due to the inventory turn and the additional investment required to fund sales in the sterling jewelers and zale divisions utilizing inhouse customer finance of the total investment required to open a new store in the us between 50 and 60 is typically accounted for by working capital new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact fiscal 2017 cash flow resultsin fiscal 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 6783 million as compared to 4433 million in fiscal 2016 the increase of 2350 million is attributable to a 753 million increase in net income a 225 million increase in depreciation and amortization including amortization of unfavorable intangible liabilities related to the elevated level of capital expenditures since the acquisition of zale in fiscal 2014 and the following cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilitiescash used for accounts receivable was 1027 million compared to 1898 million in fiscal 2016 reflecting an increase in the underlying accounts receivable as a result of the 50 basis point decline in the collection rate from customers the collection rate decline is due principally to a continuation of the shift in credit plan mix towards plans requiring lower monthly payments and an increase in the average transaction value our receivable portfolio has experienced growth compared to the prior year end however this growth trajectory has flattened in recent periods credit applications compared to the prior year end are down by approximately 10 which is driven by declines in retail traffic primarily mall traffic which has has lowered the number of active credit accounts compared to the prior year end by approximately 23000 or 15 slowed growth in the receivable portfolio has also contributed to a higher rate of chargeoffs as a percentage of average gross accounts receivable of 107 in the current year compared to 99 in the prior year as accounts are chargedoff that were originated in periods of high portfolio growth during a period of slower portfolio growth this ratio will increase cash used for inventory and

to the reliance on key estimates are listed below a comprehensive listing of signets critical accounting policies is set forth in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 revenue recognition for extended service plans and lifetime warranty agreements espthe company recognizes revenue related to lifetime warranty sales in proportion to when the expected costs will be incurred the deferral period for lifetime warranty sales in each division is determined from patterns of claims costs including estimates of future claims costs expected to be incurred management reviews the trends in claims to assess whether changes are required to the revenue and cost recognition rates utilized a significant change in estimates related to the time period or pattern in which warrantyrelated costs are expected to be incurred could materially impact revenues the deferral period and recognition rates of deferred revenue related to lifetime warranty sales is determined based on multiyear patterns of claims costs therefore a shift in historical experience of claims cost and frequency over several periods would be required to alter the revenue recognition pattern materially all direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognizedthe sterling jewelers division sells esp subject to certain conditions to perform repair work over the life of the product revenue from the sale of the lifetime esp is recognized consistent with the estimated pattern of claim costs expected to be incurred by the company in connection with performing under the esp obligations based on an evaluation of historical claims data management currently estimates that substantially all claims will be incurred within 17 years of the sale of the warranty contract in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 an operational change related to the sterling jewelers divisions esp associated with ring sizing was made to further align zale and sterling esp policies as a result revenue from the sale of these lifetime esp in the sterling jewelers division is deferred and recognized over 17 years for all plans with approximately 57 of

respectivelyproperty plant and equipment property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable potentially impaired assets or asset groups are identified by reviewing the cash flows of individual stores recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset based on the companys internal business plans if the undiscounted cash flow is less than the assets carrying amount the impairment charge recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the company utilizes historical experience internal business plans and an appropriate discount rate to estimate the fair value property and equipment at stores planned for closure are depreciated over a revised estimate of their useful lives in fiscal 2017 the income statement includes a charge of 13 million for impairment of assets as compared to 07 million in fiscal 2016 property plant and equipment net totaled 8229 million as of january 28 2017 and 7276 million as of january 30 2016 depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was 1750 million and 1614 million respectively application of alternative assumptions such as changes in estimates of future cash flows could produce significantly different results a 10 decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have had a material impact on the companys results of operations in fiscal 2017goodwill and intangibles goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in evaluating goodwill for impairment the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill if the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required however if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then the twostep goodwill impairment test is performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment to be recognized if any the twostep impairment test involves estimating the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies the annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the sterling jewelers reporting unit is the last day of the fourth quarter the annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the reporting units associated with the zale division and the other reporting unit is may 31 there have been no goodwill impairment charges recorded during the fiscal periods presented in the consolidated financial statements as financial results for the reporting units 74table of contentshave met or exceeded financial projections developed at the time of the acquisitions if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required  goodwill totaled 5176 million as of january 28 2017 and 5155 million as of january 30 2016 intangible assets with definite lives are amortized and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying amount the company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset intangible assets with definite lives net of accumulated amortization totaled 122 million as of january 28 2017 and 256 million as of january 30 2016intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the second quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount the company estimates the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compares that value with its carrying amount and records an impairment charge if any if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled 4048 million as of january 28 2017 and 4022 million as of january 30 2016  income taxesincome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on managements evaluation of all available evidence both positive and negative including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and results of recent operations  the company recorded a valuation allowance of 315 million and 319 million as of january 28 2017 and january 30 2016 respectively due to uncertainties related to the companys ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating losses foreign tax credits and foreign capital losses carried forward the annual effective tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates the company does not recognize tax benefits related to positions taken on certain tax matters unless the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities at any point in time various tax years are subject to or are in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities the company records a reserve for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties to the extent that managements estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made if the reserve for uncertain tax positions decreased by 10 the impact would be approximately 10 million as of january 28 2017 see note 9 in item 8 for additional information regarding deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefitsaccounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at their nominal amounts and primarily include account balances outstanding from sterling jewelers division inhouse customer finance programs the finance receivables from the inhouse customer finance programs are comprised of a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance the initial acceptance of customer finance arrangements is based on proprietary consumer credit model scores subsequent to the initial financed purchase the company monitors the credit quality of its customer finance receivable portfolio based on payment activity driving the aging of receivables as well as proprietary models assessing each accounts probability of default subsequent to the initial financed purchase the company monitors the credit quality of its customer finance receivable portfolio based on payment activity driving the aging of receivables as well as through the use of proprietary behavioral and collection models which assess each accounts probability of default based on performance on their account and regularly refreshed credit bureau attributesaccounts receivable under the customer finance programs are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts this allowance represents managements estimate of the expected losses in the accounts receivable portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is calculated using a model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates an allowance for amounts 90 days aged and under is established based on historical loss experience and payment performance information a 100 allowance is made for any amount aged more than 90 days on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy the recencyaging methodology is based on receipt of qualifying payments which vary depending on the account status a customers account ages each month five days after their due date listed on their statement allowing for a grace period before collection efforts begin a qualifying payment can be no less than 75 of the scheduled payment increasing with the delinquency level if an account holder is two payments behind then they must make a full minimum payment to return to current status if an account holder is three payments behind then they must make three full payments before returning to a current status if an account holder is more than three payments behind then the entire past due amount is required to return to a current status the allowance 75table of contentscalculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analysis is required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolioallowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the consolidated income statement receivables are charged off to the allowance when amounts become more than 120 days aged on the recency method and more than 240 days aged on the contractual method the allowance at january 28 2017 was 1387 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of 19520 million this compares to an allowance of 1300 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of 18559 million at january 30 2016 if managements estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts had been different by 10 at the end of fiscal 2017 cost of sales would have been impacted by approximately 139 millioninventoriesinventories are primarily held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using weightedaverage cost for all inventories except for inventories held in the companys diamond sourcing operations where cost is determined using specific identification inventory reserves for obsolete slow moving or defective items are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based on targeted inventory turn rates future demand management strategy and market conditions due to the inventory being primarily comprised of precious stones and metals including gold the age of the inventory has a limited impact on the estimated market value inventory reserves for shrinkage are estimated and recorded based on historical physical inventory results expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and distribution centers historically the companys actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be materially accurate management does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that changes in the companys inventory shrinkage levels will occur so as to have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations in future periods the total inventory reserve was 432 million at the end of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 total inventory at january 28 2017 was 24493

the uk plan provides benefits to participating eligible employees beginning in fiscal 2014 a change to the benefit structure was implemented and members benefits that accumulate after that date are now based upon career average salaries whereas previously all benefits were based on salaries at retirement the company utilizes significant assumptions along with the actual employee census data in determining its net periodic pension cost and benefit obligations included in the consolidated financial statements the net periodic pension cost of the uk plan is measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the net periodic pension cost is charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statements see note 19 in item 8 for additional informationthe funded status of the uk plan is recognized on the balance sheet and is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation measured at the balance sheet date gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise and are not included as components of net periodic pension cost are recognized net of tax in oci the funded status of the uk plan at january 28 2017 was a 319 million asset as compared to a 513 million asset at january 30 2016 based on the composition of the assets held and obligations of the uk plan as of january 28 2017 a 10 basis point change in the discount rate would have changed the funded status of the uk plan by approximately 38 million the estimated net periodic pension cost in fiscal 2017 would have changed by approximately 06 million if a 10 basis point change in the

asset may not be recoverable potentially impaired assets or asset groups are identified by reviewing the cash flows of individual stores recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset based on the companys internal business plans if the undiscounted cash flow is less than the assets carrying amount the impairment charge recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the company utilizes historical experience internal business plans and an appropriate discount rate to estimate the fair value property and equipment at stores planned for closure are depreciated over a revised estimate of their useful lives see note 13 for additional discussion of the companys property plant and equipment 88table of contentso goodwill and intangibles in a business combination the company estimates and records the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired the fair value of these intangible assets and liabilities is estimated based on managements assessment including determination of appropriate valuation technique and consideration of any third party appraisals when necessary significant estimates in valuing intangible assets and liabilities acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows associated with the acquired asset or liability expected life and discount rates the excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill goodwill is recorded by the companys reporting units based on the acquisitions made by each goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in evaluating goodwill for impairment the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill if the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then no further testing is required however if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then the twostep goodwill impairment test is performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment to be recognized if any the twostep impairment test involves estimating the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies the annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the sterling jewelers reporting unit is the last day of the fourth quarter the annual testing date for goodwill allocated to the reporting units associated with the zale division and the other reporting unit is may 31 there have been no goodwill impairment charges recorded during the fiscal periods presented in the consolidated financial statements as financial results for the reporting units have met or exceeded financial projections developed at the time of the acquisitions if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required  intangible assets with definite lives are amortized and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying amount the company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the second quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount the company estimates the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compares that value with its carrying amount and records an impairment charge if any if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required  see note 14 for additional discussion of the companys goodwill and intangibles p derivatives and hedge accounting the company enters into various types of derivative instruments to mitigate certain risk exposures related to changes in commodity costs and foreign exchange rates derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities with an offset to net income or other comprehensive income oci depending on whether the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge if a derivative instrument meets certain criteria it may be designated as a cash flow hedge on the date it is entered into for cash flow hedge transactions the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized directly in equity as a component of aoci and is recognized in the consolidated income statements in the same periods and on the same financial statement line in which the hedged item affects net income amounts excluded from the effectiveness calculation and any ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the consolidated income statements in addition gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the normal course of business the company may terminate cash flow hedges prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction for cash flow hedges terminated prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction management monitors the probability of the associated forecasted cash flow transactions to assess whether any gain or loss recorded in aoci should be immediately recognized in net income cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities see note 17 for additional discussion of the companys derivatives and hedge activities q

all benefits were based on salaries at retirement the uk plans assets are held by the uk plan89table of contentsthe net periodic pension cost of the uk plan is measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee attrition gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions if such gains or losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of the employees the net periodic pension cost is charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statements  the funded status of the uk plan is recognized on the balance sheet and is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation measured at the balance sheet date gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise

compensation signet measures sharebased compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost as an expense on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period of employees certain share plans include a condition whereby vesting is contingent on growth exceeding a given target and therefore awards granted with this condition are considered to be performancebased awards signet estimates fair value using a blackscholes model for awards granted under the omnibus plan and the binomial valuation model for awards granted under the share saving plans deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on the income tax returns of subsidiaries are recorded by signet based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the subsidiaries statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a deduction differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the subsidiaries income tax return are recorded in additional paidincapital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the income statement if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paidincapital exists from previous awards sharebased compensation is primarily recorded in
