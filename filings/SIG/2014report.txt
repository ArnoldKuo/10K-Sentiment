direct diamond sourcing limited in fiscal 2013 signet was appointed by rio tinto as a select diamantaire which provides the company with a contracted allocation of rough diamonds provided by rio tinto as well as entered into other supplier agreements in fiscal 2014 signet acquired a diamond polishing factory in gaborone botswana and established a diamond buying office in india these developments in signets longterm diamond sourcing capabilities mean that signet is able to buy rough diamonds directly from the miners and then have the stones marked cut and polished in its own polishing facility signets objective with this initiative is to secure additional reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for our customers while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain  direct sourcing of polished diamonds  the us division purchases loose polished diamonds on the world markets and from signets wholly owned diamond polishing factory in botswana as well as outsources the majority of casting assembly and finishing operations to third parties in addition signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers in combination these account for 40 of signets diamond merchandise by using these approaches the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling the us division to provide better value to the customer which helps to increase market share and achieve higher gross merchandise margins the contract manufacturing strategy also allows signets buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and in turn leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products  sourcing of finished merchandise  merchandise is purchased as a finished product where the item is complex the merchandise is considered likely to have a less predictable sales pattern or where the labor cost can be reduced this method of buying inventory provides the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with the supplier thereby reducing the risk of over or underpurchasing  management believes that the divisions scale and strong balance sheet enables it to purchase merchandise at an advantageous price and on favorable terms  merchandise held on consignment  merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs this minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and obsolescence and provides the flexibility to return nonperforming merchandise all of signets consignment inventory is held in the us at february 1 2014 the us division held 3126 million february 2 2013 2277 million of merchandise on consignment see note 11 of item 8  suppliers  in fiscal 2014 the five largest suppliers collectively

with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with third party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in asia    16    table of contents the division benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers and damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results although management believes that alternative sources of supply are available the abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the holiday season could result in a materially adverse effect on performance therefore a regular dialogue is maintained with suppliers particularly in the present economic climate  luxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies to sell their timepieces on a store by store basis in the us signet sells its luxury watch brands primarily through jared where management believes that they help attract customers to jared and build sales in all categories  raw materials and the supply chain  the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a much lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones diamonds account for about 55 and gold about 15 of the us divisions cost of merchandise sold respectively  the ability of signet to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs varies and an inability to increase retail prices could result in lower profitability signet has over time been able to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs due to the visibility of cost increases and the turn of inventory  signet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of options net zerocost collar arrangements forward contracts and commodity purchasing it is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds the cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry with labor costs also being a significant factor management continues to seek ways to reduce the cost of goods sold and enhance the resilience of its supply chain  the largest product category sold by signet is diamonds and diamond jewelry changes in government policy in a number of african diamond producing countries have caused significant changes in the structure of the diamond supply chain in recent years in addition there are changes in the ownership of diamond mines and further major changes are likely  inventory management  sophisticated inventory management systems for merchandise testing assortment planning allocation and replenishment are in place thereby reducing inventory risk by enabling management to identify and respond quickly to changes in customers buying patterns the majority of merchandise is common to all us division mall stores with the remainder allocated to reflect demand in individual stores management believes that the merchandising and inventory management systems as well as improvements in the productivity of the centralized distribution center have allowed the us division to achieve consistent improvement in inventory turns the vast majority of inventory is held at stores rather than in the central distribution facility other sales  while custom design and repair services represent less than 10 of sales they account for approximately 30 of transactions and have been identified by management as an important opportunity to build customer loyalty all jared stores have a highly visible design and service center which is open the same hours as the store the repair centers meet the repair requirements of the store in which they are located and also provide the same service for the us divisions mall brand stores as a result nearly all customer repairs are performed inhouse unlike many other retailers which do this through subcontractors the custom design and repair function has its own field management and training structure    17    table of contents the us division sells as a separate item a lifetime repair service plan for jewelry these plans cover services such as ring sizing refinishing and polishing rhodium plating of white gold earring repair chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that

websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers which are referred to as virtual inventory virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and instore virtual inventory reduces the divisions investment in inventory while increasing the selection available to the customer  us marketing and advertising  management believes customers confidence in our retail brands store brand name recognition and advertising of branded differentiated and exclusive ranges are important factors in determining buying decisions in the jewelry industry where the majority of merchandise is unbranded therefore the us division continues to strengthen and promote its brands by delivering superior customer service and building brand name recognition the marketing channels used include television digital media desktop mobile and social radio print catalog direct mail telephone marketing point of sale signage and instore displays  while marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year the level of activity is concentrated at periods when customers are expected to be most receptive to

us jewelry market offering finance facilities benefits our customers and that managing the process inhouse is a strength of signets us division the us division            establishes credit policies that take into account the overall impact on the business in particular the us divisions objective is to facilitate the sale of jewelry and to collect the outstanding credit balance as quickly as possible minimizing risk and enabling the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using the credit facility in contrast management believes that many financial institutions focus on earning interest by maximizing the outstanding credit balance            utilizes proprietary authorization and collection models which consider information on the behavior of the divisions customers

in the income statement the allowance is calculated using factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those amounts 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analyses are required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio  each individual application for credit is evaluated centrally against set lending criteria the risks associated with the granting of credit to particular groups of customers with similar characteristics are balanced against the gross merchandise margin earned by the proposed sales to those customers management believes that the primary drivers of the net bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary customer credit models used when granting customer credit the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances credit sales as a percentage to total us sales and the overall macroeconomic environment cash flows associated with the granting of credit to customers of the individual store are included in the projections used when considering store investment

conditions therefore a decline in consumer spending whether due to adverse changes in the economy changes in tax policy or other factors that reduce our customers demand for our products may unfavorably impact signets future sales and earnings  jewelry purchases are discretionary and are dependent on consumers perceptions of general economic conditions particularly as jewelry is often perceived to be a luxury purchase adverse changes in the economy and periods when discretionary spending by consumers may be under pressure could unfavorably impact sales and earnings  the success of signets operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers consumer confidence employment the rate of change in employment the level of consumers disposable income and income available for discretionary expenditure the savings ratio business conditions interest rates consumer debt and asset values availability of credit and levels of taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate signets success also depends upon its reputation for integrity in sourcing its merchandise which if adversely affected could impact consumer sentiment and willingness to purchase signets merchandise  as 16 of signets sales are accounted for by its uk division economic conditions in the eurozone have a significant impact on the uk economy even though the uk is not a member of the eurozone therefore developments in the eurozone could adversely impact trading in the uk division in addition developments in the eurozone could also adversely impact the us economy  we depend on shopping malls and other retail centers to attract customers to many of our stores  many of our stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers that benefit from the ability of anchor retail tenants generally large department stores and other attractions to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at shopping centers whether because of the economic slowdown a decline in the popularity of shopping centers the closing of anchor stores or otherwise could result in reduced sales at our stores and excess inventory we may respond by increasing discounts or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and operating results  more than half of us sales are made utilizing customer finance provided by signet therefore any deterioration in the consumers financial position could adversely impact sales earnings and the collectability of accounts receivable  any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increase in consumer debt levels may inhibit consumers use of credit and decrease the consumers ability to satisfy signets requirement for access to customer finance and could in turn have an adverse effect on the us divisions sales furthermore any downturn in general or local economic conditions in particular an increase in unemployment in the markets in which the us division operates may adversely affect its collection of outstanding accounts receivable its net bad debt charge and hence earnings  changes to the regulatory requirements regarding the granting of credit to customers could adversely impact sales and operating income  more than half of signets us sales utilize its inhouse customer financing programs and about a further 34 of purchases are made using third party bank cards signets ability to extend credit to customers and the terms on which it is achieved depends on many factors including compliance with applicable state and federal laws and    27    table of contents  regulations any of which may change from time to time and such changes in law relating to the provision of credit and associated services could adversely affect sales and income in addition other restrictions arising from applicable law could cause limitations in credit terms currently offered or a reduction in the level of credit granted by the us division or by third parties and this could adversely impact sales income or cash flow as could any reduction in the level of credit granted by the us division or by third parties as a result of the restrictions placed on fees and interest charged  the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the us doddfrank act creates a bureau of consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking and supervisory authority for a wide range of consumer financial services including signets customer finance programs the bureaus authority became effective in july 2011 any new regulatory initiatives by the bureau could impose additional costs andor restrictions on credit practices on the us division which could adversely affect its ability to conduct its business  signets share price may be volatile  signets share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in the actual or anticipated results and financial conditions of signet and other companies in the retail industry and the stock markets view of the potential zale transaction in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other shares in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies  the concentration of a significant proportion of sales and an even larger share of profits in the fourth quarter means results are dependent on performance during that period  signets business is highly seasonal with a significant proportion of its sales and operating profit generated during its fourth quarter which includes the holiday season management expects to continue to experience a seasonal fluctuation in its sales and earnings therefore there is limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in its operations and strategies in other quarters or to recover from any extensive disruption for example due to sudden adverse changes in consumer confidence inclement weather conditions having an impact on a significant number of stores in the last few days immediately before christmas day or disruption to warehousing and store replenishment systems a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any fiscal year would therefore be expected to have a material adverse effect on the annual results of operations disruption at lesser peaks in sales at valentines day and mothers day would be expected to impact the results to a lesser extent  signet is dependent on a variety of financing resources to fund its operations and growth which may include equity cash balances and debt financing  while signet has a strong balance sheet with significant cash balances and available lines of credit it is dependent upon the availability of equity cash balances and debt financing to fund its operations and growth if signets access to capital were to become significantly constrained its financing costs would likely increase its financial condition would be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected the changes in general credit market conditions also affect signets ability to arrange and the cost of arranging credit facilities  management prepares annual budgets medium term plans and risk models which help to identify the future capital requirements so that appropriate facilities can be put in place on a timely basis if these models are inaccurate adequate facilities may not be available  signets borrowing agreements include various financial covenants and operating restrictions a material deterioration in its financial performance could result in a covenant being breached if signet were to breach or believed it was going to breach a financial covenant it would have to renegotiate its terms with current lenders or find alternative sources of finance if current lenders required cancellation of facilities or early repayment    28    table of contents in addition signets reputation in the financial markets and its corporate governance practices can influence the availability of capital the cost of capital and its share price  as signet has material cash balances it is exposed to counterparty credit risks  at february 1 2014 signet had cash and cash equivalents of 2476 million february 2 2013 3010 million signet holds its cash and cash equivalents predominantly in aaa rated liquidity funds and in various bank accounts if an institution or fund in which signet invests its cash and cash equivalents were to default or become insolvent signet may be unable to recover these amounts or obtain access to them in a timely manner  movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates impact the results and balance sheet of signet  signet publishes its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars it held approximately 88 of its total assets in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar at february 1 2014 and generated approximately 84 of its sales and 93 of its operating income in us dollars for the fiscal year then ended nearly all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in uk pounds sterling therefore its results and balance sheet are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar accordingly any decrease in the weighted average value of the pound sterling against the us dollar would decrease reported sales and operating income  the monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division  where pounds sterling are held or used to fund the cash flow requirements of the business any decrease in the weighted average value of the pound sterling against the us dollar would reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and increase the amount of any pounds sterling borrowings  in addition the prices of materials and certain products bought on the international markets by the uk division are denominated in us dollars and therefore the uk division has an exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on the cost of goods sold  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities particularly polished diamonds and gold which account for the majority of signets merchandise costs could adversely impact its earnings and cash availability  the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones in particular diamonds account for about 47 of signets merchandise costs and gold about 15 in fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2014 polished diamond prices experienced a single digit percentage increase when compared to fiscal 2013 levels unlike as had occurred in prior years industry forecasts indicate that over the medium and longer term the demand for diamonds will probably increase faster than the growth in supply particularly as a result of growing demand in countries such as china and india therefore the cost of diamonds is anticipated to rise over time although fluctuations in price are likely to continue to occur the mining production and inventory policies followed by major producers of rough diamonds can have a significant impact on diamond prices as can the inventory and buying patterns of jewelry retailers and other parties in the supply chain  while jewelry manufacturing is the major final demand for gold management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly impacted by investment transactions which have resulted in significant volatility and overall increases in gold cost over the past several years followed by somewhat of a decline in fiscal 2014 signets cost    29    table of contents  of merchandise and potentially its earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly escalate  the availability of diamonds is significantly influenced by the political situation in diamond producing countries and by the kimberley process an intergovernmental agreement for the international trading of rough diamonds until acceptable alternative sources of diamonds can be developed any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from significant producing countries or to the trading in rough and polished diamonds which could occur as a result of disruption to the kimberley process could adversely affect signet as well as the retail jewelry market as a whole in 2012 the kimberley process chaired by the united states initiated a process to review ways to strengthen and reform the kimberley process including reviewing the definition of a conflict diamond in january 2013 south africa became the chair and the review process was expected to continue however no reform efforts were achieved in 2014 the kimberley process is being chaired by china which will be followed by angola in 2015 in addition the current kimberley process decision making procedure is dependent on reaching a consensus among member governments which can result in the protracted resolution of issues and there is little expectation of significant reform over the longterm the impact of this review process on the supply of diamonds and consumers perception of the diamond supply chain is unknown in addition to the kimberley process the supply of diamonds to the us is also impacted by certain governmental trade sanctions imposed on zimbabwe  the possibility of constraints in the supply of diamonds of a size and quality signet requires to meet its merchandising requirements may result in changes in signets supply chain practices for example its rough sourcing initiative in addition signet may from time to time choose to hold more inventory to purchase raw materials at an earlier stage in the supply chain or enter into commercial agreements of a nature that it currently does not use such actions could require the investment of cash andor additional management skills such actions may not result in the expected returns and other projected benefits anticipated by management  an inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability historically jewelry retailers have been able over time to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs however in general particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices as signet uses an average cost inventory methodology volatility in its commodity costs may also result in a time lag before cost increases are reflected in retail prices there is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur in addition any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customer  in august 2012 the sec pursuant to the doddfrank act issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the gold supply chain is complex and while management believes that the rules will only cover less than 1 of annual worldwide gold production based upon current estimates the final rules require signet and other jewelry retailers and manufacturers that file with the sec to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin of the statutorily designated minerals that are used in products sold by signet in the us and elsewhere signet must first report to the sec on our country of origin inquiries our due diligence measures the results of those activities and our related determinations in may 2014 with respect to the calendar year ended december 31 2013  compliance with the rules to date has not and will not likely add significantly to signets costs and management does not expect this increase to be material there may be reputational risks with customers and other stakeholders if signet due to the complexity of the global supply chain is unable to sufficiently verify the origin for the relevant metals also if the responses of parts of signets supply chain to the verification requests are adverse it may harm signets ability to obtain merchandise and add to compliance costs  the final rules also cover tungsten and tin which are contained in a small proportion of items that are sold by signet it is possible that other minerals such as diamonds could be subject to similar rules    30    table of contents price increases may have an adverse impact on signets performance  if significant price increases are implemented by either division across a wide range of merchandise the impact on earnings will depend on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customer to higher prices such price increases may result in lower achieved gross margin dollars and adversely impact earnings  signets competitors are specialty jewelry retailers as well as other jewelry retailers including department stores mass merchandisers discount stores apparel and accessory fashion stores brand retailers shopping clubs home shopping television channels direct home sellers online retailers and auction sites in addition other retail categories for example electronics and other forms of expenditure such as travel also compete for consumers discretionary expenditure this is particularly so during the holiday gift giving season therefore the price of jewelry relative to other products influences the proportion of consumers expenditure that is spent on jewelry if the relative price of jewelry increases signets sales and earnings may decline  the failure to satisfy the accounting requirements for hedge accounting or default or insolvency of a counterparty to a hedging contract could adversely impact results  signet hedges a portion of its purchases of gold for both its us and uk divisions and hedges the us dollar requirements of its uk division the failure to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate accounting requirements or a default or insolvency of a counterparty to a contract could increase the volatility of results and may impact the timing of recognition of gains and losses in the income statement  the inability of signet to obtain merchandise that customers wish to purchase particularly ahead of and during the fourth quarter would adversely impact sales  the abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the fourth quarter would result in a material adverse effect on signets business  also if management misjudges expected customer demand or fails to identify changes in customer demand andor its supply chain does not respond in a timely manner it could adversely impact signets results by causing either a shortage of merchandise or an accumulation of excess inventory  signet benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results management holds regular reviews with major suppliers signets most significant supplier accounts for 6 of merchandise government requirements regarding sources of commodities such as those required by the doddfrank act could result in signet choosing to terminate relationships with a limited number of suppliers  luxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies to sell their ranges on a store by store basis and most of the leading brands have been steadily reducing the number of agencies in the us and the uk over recent years the watch brands sold by ernest jones and to a lesser extent jared help attract customers and build sales in all categories therefore an inability to obtain or retain watch agencies for a location could harm the performance of that particular store in the case of ernest jones the inability to gain additional prestige watch agencies is an important factor in and may reduce the likelihood of opening new stores which could adversely impact sales growth  the growth in importance of branded merchandise within the jewelry market may adversely impact signets sales and earnings if it is unable to obtain supplies of branded merchandise that the customer wishes to purchase in addition if signet loses the distribution rights to an important branded jewelry range it could adversely impact sales and earnings    31    table of contents signet has had success in recent years in the development of branded merchandise that is exclusive to its stores if signet is not able to further develop such branded merchandise or is unable to successfully develop further such initiatives it may adversely impact sales and earnings  an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earnings  management regards the customer experience as an essential element in the success of its business competition for suitable individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs therefore an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earnings  loss of confidence by consumers in signets brand names poor execution of marketing programs and reduced marketing expenditure could have a detrimental impact on sales  primary factors in determining customer buying decisions in the jewelry sector include customer confidence in the retailer and in the brands it sells together with the level and quality of customer service the ability to differentiate signets stores and merchandise from competitors by its branding marketing and advertising programs is an important factor in attracting consumers if these programs are poorly executed or the level of support for them is reduced or the customer loses confidence in any of signets brands for whatever reason it could unfavorably impact sales and earnings  longterm changes in consumer attitudes to jewelry could be unfavorable and harm jewelry sales  consumer attitudes to diamonds gold and other precious metals and gemstones also influence the level of signets sales attitudes could be affected by a variety of issues including concern over the source of raw materials the impact of mining and refining of minerals on the environment the local community and the political stability of the producing country labor conditions in the supply chain and the availability of and consumer attitudes to substitute products such as cubic zirconia moissanite and laboratory created diamonds a negative change in consumer attitudes to jewelry could adversely impact sales and earnings  the retail jewelry industry is highly fragmented and competitive aggressive discounting or going out of business sales by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short term  the retail jewelry industry is competitive if signets competitive position deteriorates operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected  aggressive discounting by competitors particularly those holding going out of business sales may adversely impact signets performance in the short term this is particularly the case for easily comparable pieces of jewelry of similar quality sold through stores that are situated near to those that signet operates  the us division faces significant competition from independent specialty jewelry retailers that are able to adjust their competitive stance for example on pricing to local market conditions this can put individual signet stores at a competitive disadvantage as the us division has a national pricing strategy  the inability to rent stores that satisfy managements operational and financial criteria could harm sales as could changes in locations where customers shop  signets results are dependent on a number of factors relating to its stores these include the availability of desirable property the demographic characteristics of the area around the store the design and maintenance of the stores the availability of attractive locations within the shopping center that also meet the operational and financial criteria of management the terms of leases and signets relationship with major landlords the us division leases 19 of its store locations from simon property group signet has no other relationship with any lessor relating to 10 or more of its store locations if signet is unable to rent stores that satisfy its operational    32    table of contents  and financial criteria or if there is a disruption in its relationship with its major landlords sales could be adversely affected  given the length of property leases that signet enters into it is dependent upon the continued popularity of particular retail locations as signet tests and develops new types of store locations and designs there is no certainty as to their success the majority of longterm space growth opportunities in the us are in new developments and therefore future store space is in part dependent on the investment by real estate developers on new projects limited new real estate development taking place would make it challenging to identify and secure suitable new store locations the uk division has a more diverse range of store locations than in the us including some exposure to smaller retail centers which do not justify the investment required to refurbish the site to the current store format consequently the uk division is gradually closing stores in such locations as leases expire or satisfactory property transactions can be executed however the ability to secure such property transactions is not certain as the uk division is already represented in nearly all major retail centers a small annual decrease in store space is expected in the medium term which will adversely impact sales growth  the rate of new store development is dependent on a number of factors including obtaining suitable real estate the capital resources of signet the availability of appropriate staff and management and the level of the financial return on investment required by management  signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders whose behavior may be affected by its management of social ethical and environmental risks  social ethical and environmental matters influence signets reputation demand for merchandise by consumers the ability to recruit staff relations with suppliers and standing in the financial markets signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders customers shareholders employees and suppliers in recent years stakeholder expectations have increased and signets success and reputation will depend on its ability to meet these higher expectations  inadequacies in and disruption to internal controls and systems could result in lower sales and increased costs or adversely impact the reporting and control procedures  signet is dependent on the suitability reliability and durability of its systems and procedures including its accounting information technology data protection warehousing and distribution systems if support ceased for a critical externally supplied software package or system management would have to implement an alternative software package or system or begin supporting the software internally disruption to parts of the business could result in lower sales and increased costs  security breaches and other disruptions to signets information technology infrastructure and databases could interfere with signets operations and could compromise signets and its customers and suppliers information exposing signet to liability which would cause signets business and reputation to suffer  signet operates in multiple channels and in the us division maintains its own customer finance operation signet is also increasingly using mobile devices social media and other online activities to connect with customers staff and other stakeholders therefore in the ordinary course of business signet relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including ecommerce sales supply chain merchandise distribution customer invoicing and collection of payments signet uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally signet collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of signets customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and    33    table of contents  maintenance of this information is critical to signets business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans signets information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise signets networks and the information stored there could be accessed manipulated publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage signets reputation which could adversely affect signets business in addition it could harm signets ability to execute its business and adversely impact sales costs and earnings  an adverse decision in legal proceedings andor tax matters could reduce earnings  in march 2008 private plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit for an unspecified amount against sterling jewelers inc sterling a subsidiary of signet in us district court for the southern district of new york which has been referred to private arbitration in september 2008 the us equal employment opportunities commission filed a lawsuit against sterling in us district court for the western district of new york sterling denies the allegations from both parties and has been defending these cases vigorously if however it is unsuccessful in either defense sterling could be required to pay substantial damages at this point no outcome or amount of loss is able to be estimated see note 22 in item 8  at any point in time various tax years are subject to or are in the process of audit by various taxing authorities to the extent that managements estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact income tax in the period in which such determinations are made  failure to comply with labor regulations could harm the business  failure by signet to comply with labor regulations could result in fines and legal actions in addition the ability to recruit and retain staff could be harmed  failure to comply with changes in law and regulations could adversely affect the business  signets policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations changing legal and regulatory requirements have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment in which the business operates and the cost of compliance failure to comply with the various regulatory requirements may result in damage to signets reputation civil and criminal liability fines and penalties and further increase the cost of regulatory compliance changes in tax legislation for example the elimination of lifo for us tax accounting purposes could adversely impact cash flow  investors may face difficulties in enforcing proceedings against signet jewelers limited as it is domiciled in bermuda  it is doubtful whether courts in bermuda would enforce judgments obtained by investors in other jurisdictions including the us and the uk against the parent company or its directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in bermuda against the parent company or its directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions  any difficulty executing an acquisition a business combination or a major business initiative may result in expected returns and other projected benefits from such an exercise not being realized  any difficulty in executing an acquisition a business combination or a major business initiative including its direct diamond sourcing capabilities may result in expected returns and other projected benefits from such an    34    table of contents  exercise not being realized the acquisition of companies with operating margins lower than that of signet may cause an overall lower operating margin for signet a significant transaction could also disrupt the operation of its current activities signets current borrowing agreements place certain limited constraints on its ability to make an acquisition or enter into a business combination and future borrowing agreements could place tighter constraints on such actions  proposed acquisitionsignets proposed acquisition of zale is subject to zale stockholder approval certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and the expected benefits from the acquisition may not be fully realized  on february 19 2014 signet entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with zale to acquire all of zales issued and outstanding common stock for 2100 per share in cash consideration with an approximate transaction value of 14 billion including net debt although signet has entered into a voting and support agreement with golden gate capital the beneficial owner of approximately 22 of zales common stock signet cannot predict whether zale stockholder approval will be obtained or whether or when the required regulatory approvals under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 hsr will be obtained or if the closing conditions will be satisfied a failure to close the transaction or significant delays in doing so may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and our business financial condition and results of operations the federal trade commission ftc may condition the approval of the acquisition on divestiture of certain assets including the divestiture of certain stores which if agreed to by signet may materially affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition and there can be no assurance that such divestiture can be completed on terms satisfactory to signet and the ftc under the merger agreement signet is not required to take any actions to obtain antitrust approvals that would individually or in the aggregate result in i the loss of revenue of zale in excess of 1350 million ii the loss of sales of signet in excess of 1350 million or iii the combination of losses of revenues of zale and sales of signet in excess of 1350 million in the aggregate in each case as measured by such partys fiscal 2013 revenue or sales respectively reported in its annual audited financial statements for such year the merger agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both zale and signet and provides that in connection with the termination of the merger agreement by signet or zale under certain specified circumstances zale will be required to pay signet a termination fee of 267 million signet may also be required to pay zale a termination fee of 534 million if antitrust clearance is not received prior to february 19 2015 or may 15 2015 if all conditions to closing other than regulatory approval have been obtained prior to that date in the event that either party terminates the merger agreement because zales stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement following the making of a competing offer zale will be required to reimburse signet for its expenses in an amount not exceeding 125 million signet expects to issue at least 14 billion of debt during the second half of fiscal 2015 to fund the planned acquisition of zale which will significantly increase signets outstanding debt this additional indebtedness will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives including dividends and share repurchases if the transaction closes significant changes to signets financial condition as a result of global economic changes or difficulties in the integration or execution of strategies of the newly acquired business and the diversion of significant management time and resources towards completion of the transaction and integrating the business and operations of zale may affect our ability to obtain the expected benefits from the transaction or to satisfy the financial covenants included in the terms of the financing arrangements  if signets financing for the transaction becomes unavailable the transaction may not be completed and we may be in breach of the merger agreement  we intend to finance the cash required in connection with the transaction including for expenses incurred in connection with the transaction with debt financing of approximately 14 billion which includes 600 million in securitization of signets us accounts receivable and 800 million in other debt financing signet has secured a commitment for an 800 million 364day unsecured bridge facility and a 400 million 5year unsecured term loan facility in connection with the transaction the bridge facility is expected to be replaced by permanent financing in due course the bridge facility and the term loan facility contain customary fees which will be    35    table of contents  recorded as an expense in fiscal 2015 with additional interest expense dependent on the timing of borrowings and closing of the transaction the obligation of the lenders to provide the debt financing is subject to various customary closing conditions in the event any of the closing conditions is not satisfied or waived or to the extent one or more of the lenders is unwilling to or unable to fund its commitments under the debt financing we may be required to seek alternative financing or fund the cash required in connection with the transaction ourselves due to the fact that there is no financing or funding condition in the merger agreement if we are unable to obtain funding from our financing sources for the cash required in connection with the transaction we would be in breach of the merger agreement assuming all other conditions to closing are satisfied and may be liable to zale for damages  signet will incur transactionrelated costs in connection with the transaction  we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring transactionrelated costs associated with completing the transaction combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs may be substantial nonrecurring transaction costs include but are not limited to fees paid to legal financial and accounting advisors regulatory filing fees and printing costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and zales businesses there can be no assurance that the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses as well as the elimination of certain duplicative costs will offset the incremental transactionrelated costs over time thus any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term the long term or at all  although we anticipate that zale will continue to operate as a separate brand within signet failure to successfully combine signets and zales businesses in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company  the success of the proposed transaction will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our and zales businesses to realize these anticipated benefits the businesses must be successfully combined if the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all in addition the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction these integration difficulties could result in declines in the market value of our common stock  purported stockholder class action complaints have been filed against zale signet the members of zales board of directors and signets merger subsidiary challenging the transaction and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the proposed transaction and result in substantial costs  in connection with the proposed transaction purported stockholders of zale have filed purported stockholder class action lawsuits in the delaware court of chancery those lawsuits name as defendants zale signet the members of the board of directors of zale and signets merger subsidiary among other remedies the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the proposed transaction if a final settlement is not reached or if a dismissal is not obtained these lawsuits could prevent andor delay completion of the transaction and result in substantial costs to zale and us including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors additional lawsuits may be filed against zale and us our merger subsidiary and zales directors related to the proposed transaction the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect the combined companys business financial condition or results of operations  changes in assumptions used in making accounting estimates or in accounting standards may adversely impact investor perception of the business  changes in assumptions used in making accounting estimates relating to items such as extended service plans and pensions may adversely affect signets financial results and balance sheet changes in accounting standards    36    table of contents  such as those currently being considered relating to leases could materially impact the presentation of signets results and balance sheet investors reaction to any such change in presentation is unknown such changes could also impact the way that the business is managed and access to the credit markets  loss of one or more key executive officers or employees could adversely impact performance as could the appointment of an inappropriate successor or successors  signets future success will partly depend upon the ability of senior management and other key employees to implement an appropriate business strategy while signet has entered into employment contracts with such key personnel the retention of their services cannot be guaranteed and the loss of such services or the inability to attract and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on signets ability to conduct its business in addition any new executives may wish subject to board approval to change the strategy of signet the appointment of new executives may therefore adversely impact performance      item 1b unresolved staff comments  not applicable      item 2 properties  signet attributes great importance to the location and appearance of its stores accordingly in both signets us and uk operations investment decisions on selecting sites and refurbishing stores are made centrally and strict real estate and investment criteria are applied  us property  substantially all of signets us stores are leased in addition to a minimum annual rental the majority of mall stores are also liable to pay rent based on sales above a specified base level in fiscal 2014 most of the divisions mall stores only made base rental payments under the terms of a typical lease the us business is required to conform and maintain its usage to agreed standards including meeting required advertising expenditure as a percentage of sales and is responsible for its proportionate share of expenses associated with common area maintenance utilities and taxes of the mall the initial term of a mall store lease is generally 10 years towards the end of a lease management evaluates whether to renew a lease and refit the store using similar operational and investment criteria as for a new store where management is uncertain whether the location will meet managements required return on investment but the store is profitable the leases may be renewed for one to five years during which time the stores performance is further evaluated there are typically about 200 such mall stores at any one time jared stores are normally opened on 20 year leases with options to extend the lease and rents are not sales related a refurbishment of a jared store is normally undertaken every 10 years at february 1 2014 the average unexpired lease term of us leased premises was five years and over 60 of these leases had terms expiring within five years the cost of refitting a mall store is similar to the cost of fitting out a new mall store which is typically between 400000 and 850000 jared remodels have one of two tiers the full scope tier ranges between 1100000 and 1300000 and reduced scope tier ranges between 500000 and 600000 new jared stores are typically ground leases and range between 2200000 and 2500000 management expects that about 75 new stores about 63 kay 10 jared and 2 regional brands will be opened during fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 the level of major store refurbishment increased with 68 locations including 7 jared locations being completed fiscal 2013 80 including 18 jared locations it is anticipated that refurbishment activity in fiscal 2015 will involve 92 stores in addition in fiscal 2014 65 ultra stores were converted to the kay brand and the remaining 30 stores to regional brands the investment was financed by cash flow from operating activities  the us division leases 19 of its store locations from simon property group the us division has no other relationship with any lessor relating to 10 or more of its store locations at february 1 2014 the us division had 275 million square feet of selling space february 2 2013 262 million    37    table of contents during the past five fiscal years the us business generally has been successful in renewing its store leases as they expire and has not experienced difficulty in securing suitable locations for its stores no store lease is individually material to signets us operations  a 340000 square foot head office and distribution facility is leased in akron ohio through 2032 an 86000 square foot office building next door to the head office is also leased through 2032 to which signet relocated its credit operations in fiscal 2013 a 39000 square foot repair center was opened in akron ohio during fiscal 2006 and is owned by a subsidiary of signet  uk property  at february 1 2014 signets uk division operated from six freehold premises and 513 leasehold premises the divisions stores are generally leased under full repairing and insuring leases equivalent to triple net leases in the us wherever possible signet is shortening the length of new leases that it enters into or including break clauses in order to improve the flexibility of its lease commitments at february 1 2014 the average unexpired lease term of uk premises with lease terms of less than 25 years was six years and a majority of leases had either break clauses or terms expiring within five years rents are usually subject to upward review every five years if market conditions so warrant an increasing proportion of rents also have an element related to the sales of a store subject to a minimum annual value for details of assigned leases and sublet premises see note 22 of item 8  at the end of the lease period subject to certain limited exceptions uk leaseholders generally have statutory rights to enter into a new lease of the premises on negotiated terms as current leases expire signet believes that it will be able to renew leases if desired for present store locations or to obtain leases in equivalent or improved locations in the same general area signet has not experienced difficulty in securing leases for suitable locations for its uk stores no store lease is individually material to signets uk operations  a typical uk store undergoes a major refurbishment every 10 years and a less costly store redecoration every five years it is intended that these investments will be financed by cash from operating activities the cost of refitting a store is typically between 150000 and 475000 for both hsamuel and ernest jones while expansion in prestige locations typically doubles those costs  the uk division has no relationship with any lessor relating to 10 or more of its store locations at february 1 2014 the uk division has 050 million square feet of selling space february 2 2013 052 million  signet

internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the us code and to persons resident and domiciled for tax purposes in the uk who hold common shares as an investment and not to any holders who are taxable in

advice and no action should be taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon it if you are in any doubt about your taxation position or if you are resident or domiciled outside the uk or resident or otherwise subject to taxation in a jurisdiction outside the uk or the us you should consult your own professional advisers immediately  the parent company is incorporated in bermuda the directors intend to conduct the parent companys affairs such that based on current law and practice of the relevant tax authorities the parent company will not become    42    table of contents  resident for tax purposes in any other territory this guidance is written on the basis that the parent company does not become resident in a territory other than bermuda  us taxation  as used in this discussion the term us holder means a beneficial owner of common shares who is for us federal income tax purposes i an individual us citizen or resident ii a corporation or entity treated as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the united states iii an estate whose income is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or iv a trust if either a a court within the us is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or b the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us resident for us federal income tax purposes  if a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership for us federal tax income purposes holds common shares the us federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership partnerships and partners in partnerships holding common shares are encouraged to consult their tax advisers  dividends and other distributions upon common shares  distributions made with respect to common shares will generally be includable in the income of a us holder as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the parent company as determined in accordance with us federal income tax principles the amount of such dividends will generally be treated partly as ussource and partly as foreignsource dividend income for us foreign tax credit purposes in proportion to the earnings from which they are considered paid for as long as 50 or more of the parent companys shares are directly or indirectly owned by us persons dividend income received from the parent company will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to us corporations under the us code subject to applicable limitations including a requirement that the common shares be listed for trading on the nyse the nasdaq stock market or another qualifying us exchange dividends with respect to common shares so listed that are paid to noncorporate us holders will generally be taxable at a current maximum tax rate of 20  sale or exchange of common shares  gain or loss realized by a us holder on the sale or exchange of common shares generally will be subject to us federal income tax as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the us holders tax basis in the common shares and the amount realized on the disposition such gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holder held the common shares for more than one year gain or loss if any will generally be us source for foreign tax credit purposes the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations noncorporate us holders are eligible for a current maximum 20 longterm capital gains taxation rate  information reporting and backup withholding  payments of dividends on and proceeds from a sale or other disposition of common shares may under certain circumstances be subject to information reporting and backup withholding at a rate of 28 of the cash payable to the holder unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules any amounts withheld from payments to a us holder under the backup withholding rules are not additional tax and should be allowed as a refund or credit against the us holders us federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the irs    43    table of contents passive foreign investment company status  a nonus corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company a pfic for any taxable year if at least 75 of its gross income consists of passive income such as dividends interest rents royalties or gains on the disposition of certain minority interests or at least 50 of the average value of its assets consists of assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income for the purposes of these rules a non us corporation is considered to hold and receive directly its proportionate share of the assets and income of any other corporation of whose shares it owns at least 25 by value consequently the parent companys classification under the pfic rules will depend primarily upon the composition of its assets and income  if the parent company is characterized as a pfic us holders would suffer adverse tax consequences and us federal income tax consequences different from those described above may apply these consequences may include having gains realized on the disposition of common shares treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain distributions and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of common shares the parent company believes that it is not a pfic and that it will not be a pfic for the foreseeable future however since the tests for pfic status depend upon facts not entirely within the parent companys control such as the amounts and types of its income and values of its assets no assurance can be provided that the parent company will not become a pfic us holders of pfic shares are required to file irs form 8621 annually us holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the potential application of the pfic rules to common shares  foreign financial asset reporting requirement  a us holder that is an individual and holds certain foreign financial assets including signets common shares must file irs form 8938 to report the ownership of such assets if the total value of those assets exceeds the applicable threshold amounts generally 50000 on the last day of the tax year or more than 75000 at any time during the tax year some us holders may be subject to a greater threshold before reporting is required proposed regulations also would require certain domestic entities that are formed or availed of for purposes of holding directly or indirectly specified foreign financial assets to file irs form 8938 however in general such form is not required to be filed with respect to signets common shares if they are held through a domestic financial institution  taxpayers who fail to make the required disclosure with respect to any taxable year are subject to a penalty of 10000 for such taxable year which may be increased up to 50000 for a continuing failure to file the form after being notified by the irs in addition the failure to file form 8938 will extend the statute of limitations for a taxpayers entire related income tax return and not just the portion of the return that relates to the omission until at least three years after the date on which the form 8938 is filed  all us holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the application of this reporting requirement to their circumstances  uk taxation  chargeable gains  a disposal of common shares by a shareholder who is resident in the uk may depending on individual circumstances including the availability of exemptions or allowable losses give rise to a liability to or an allowable loss for the purposes of uk taxation of chargeable gains  any chargeable gain or allowable loss on a disposal of the common shares should be calculated taking into account the allowable cost to the holder of acquiring his common shares in the case of corporate shareholders to this should be added when calculating a chargeable gain but not an allowable loss indexation allowance on the allowable cost indexation allowance is not available for noncorporate shareholders    44

falls above the current 150000 threshold  uk resident individuals in receipt of dividends from the parent company if they own less than a 10 shareholding in the parent company will be entitled to a nonpayable dividend tax credit currently at the rate of 19th of the cash dividend paid or 10 of the aggregate of the net dividend and related tax credit assuming that there is no withholding tax imposed on the dividend as to which see the section on bermuda taxation below the individual is treated as receiving for uk tax purposes gross income equal to the cash dividend plus the tax credit the

exchange translation impact  the monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division in fiscal 2015 it is anticipated a one cent movement in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would impact income before income tax by approximately 03 million    54    table of contents fiscal 2014 overview  the fiscal 2014 results were led by a same store sales increase of 44 compared to an increase of 33 in fiscal 2013 total sales were up by 57 to 42092 million compared to 39834 million in fiscal 2013 as signet follows the retail 454 reporting calendar fiscal 2013 included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the 53rd week the effect of the 53rd week added 564 million in net sales in fiscal 2013 and decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately 002 for fiscal 2013 excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 sales were up 72 see fiscal 2013 detailed commentary beginning on page 67 for further information on the impact of the 53rd week operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 135 compared to 141 in fiscal 2013 operating income and diluted earnings per share increased to 5705 million compared to 5605 million in fiscal 2013 and 456 per share compared to 435 in fiscal 2013 up by 18 and 48 respectively  at february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 signet had no longterm debt and cash and cash equivalents of 2476 and 3010 million respectively during fiscal 2014 signet repurchased approximately 16 million shares at an average cost of 6724 per share which represented 19 of the shares outstanding at the start of fiscal 2014 as compared to 64 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2013 at an average cost of 4470  drivers of operating profitability  the key drivers of operating profitability are            sales performance            gross margin            level of selling general and administrative expenses            balance between the change in same store sales and sales from new store space and            movements in the us dollar to pound sterling exchange rate as 16 of signets sales and approximately 7 of operating income including unallocated corporate administrative costs were generated in the uk in fiscal 2014 and signet reports its results in us dollars  these and other drivers are discussed more fully below  sales  sales performance in both the us and uk divisions is driven by the change in same store sales and net store selling space same store sales growth is calculated by comparison of sales in stores that were open in both the current and the prior fiscal year sales from stores that have been open for less than 12 months including acquisitions are excluded from the comparison until their 12month anniversary sales from the 12month anniversary onwards are compared against the equivalent prior period sales within the comparable store sales comparison stores closed in the current financial period are included up to the date of closure and the comparative period is correspondingly adjusted stores that have been relocated or expanded but remain within the same local geographic area are included within the comparison with no adjustment to either the current or comparative period stores that have been refurbished are also included within the comparison except for the period when the refurbishment was taking place when those stores are excluded from the comparison both for the current year and for the comparative period sales to employees are also excluded comparisons at divisional level are made in local currency and consolidated comparisons are made at constant exchange rates and exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the weighted average exchange rate for the current period ecommerce sales are included in the calculation of sales for the period and the comparative figures from the anniversary of the launch of the relevant website same store sales exclude the 53rd week in the fiscal year in which it occurs management considers same store sales useful as it is a major benchmark used by investors to judge performance within the retail industry    55    table of contents a new us store typically has sales ranging from 70 to 75 of a five year old store and will only contribute to sales for part of the fiscal year in which it is opened store openings are usually planned to occur in the third quarter and store closures in january although this does not always occur when investing in new space management has stringent operating and financial criteria us net space increased 5 in fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 11 in fiscal 2013 of which 7 related to the ultra acquisition in the uk there has typically been a decline in net space as the division has exited from retail markets where operation no longer meets the economic criteria established by management due to growth in regional malls the uk net space decreased by 3 in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013  net change in store selling space                        us     uk     signet     fiscal 2014

distribution costs of moving merchandise from suppliers to the distribution center and to stores inventory shrinkage store operating and occupancy costs net bad debt expense and charges for late payments under the us customer finance program store operating and occupancy costs include utilities rent real estate taxes common area maintenance charges and depreciation as the classification of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have inhouse customer finance programs signets gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers  the gross merchandise margin is the difference between the selling price achieved and the cost of merchandise sold expressed as a percentage of the sales price gross merchandise margin dollars is the difference expressed in monetary terms the trend in gross merchandise margin depends on signets pricing policy movements in the cost of merchandise sold changes in sales mix and the direct cost of providing services such as repairs  important factors that impact gross margin are the cost of diamonds and gold and our ability to adjust prices to offset such costs in the us division about 55 of the cost of merchandise sold is accounted for by polished diamonds and about 15 is accounted for by gold in the uk division diamonds and gold account for about 10 and about 15 respectively of the cost of merchandise sold and watches for about 45 the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate also has a material impact as a significant proportion of the merchandise sold in the uk is purchased in us dollars at times signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate but is not able to do so for diamonds for gold and currencies the hedging period can extend to 24 months although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of 12 months    56    table of contents the price of diamonds varies depending on their size cut color and clarity demand for diamonds is primarily driven by the manufacture and sale of diamond jewelry and their future price is uncertain  during fiscal 2014 while the cost of gold remained volatile the overall cost of gold decreased significantly from fiscal 2013 with an average cost of 1246 per troy ounce in january 2014 compared to an average cost of 1671 per troy ounce in january 2013 the future price of gold is uncertain  signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and as jewelry inventory turns slowly the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes time to be fully reflected in the gross margin as inventory turn is faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters changes in the cost of merchandise are more quickly reflected in the gross margin in that quarter furthermore signets hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin an increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross margin  account receivables comprise a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance the net us bad debt expense includes an estimate of the allowance for losses as of the balance sheet date the allowance is calculated using a proprietary model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance management believes that the primary drivers of the net us bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary consumer credit scores used when granting customer finance the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances us credit sales as a percentage of total us sales and the rate of change in the level of unemployment in the us economy  selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses include store staff and store administrative costs centralized administrative expenses including information technology credit and ecommerce advertising and promotional costs and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statements  the primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees employed and the level of compensation taxes and other benefits paid management varies on a store by store basis the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store nonstore staffing levels are less variable a significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales or operating profit  the level of advertising expenditure can vary the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by managements judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media  other operating income  other operating income is predominantly interest income arising from inhouse customer finance provided to signets customers by the us division its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged the credit program selected by the customer and the level of outstanding balances the level of outstanding balances is dependent on the sales of the us division the proportion of sales that use the inhouse customer finance and the monthly collection rate  operating income  to maintain operating income signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin any increase in operating costs the impact of any immature selling space and any adverse changes in other operating income same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors    57    table of contents  outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income when foreseen such as through the us divisions cost saving measures implemented in fiscal 2010 signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions the acquisition of companies with operating margins lower than that of signet may cause an overall lower operating margin for signet  the impact on operating income of a sharp unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance can be significant this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business in the medium term there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level but the time it takes varies depending on the type of cost an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter it is even more difficult to reduce base lease costs in the short or medium term as leases in us malls are typically for 10 years jared sites for 20 years and in the uk for five plus years  operating income may also be impacted by significant unusual and nonrecurring items for example in fiscal 2011 the impact of amendments to the truth in lending act had an estimated net direct adverse impact on operating income of 119 million primarily by reducing other operating income in fiscal 2010 the vacation entitlement policy in the us division was changed which resulted in the selling general and administrative costs being reduced while operating income increased by 134 million other line items may also be impacted by significant unusual and nonrecurring items for example in fiscal 2011 signet made a make whole payment of 475 million reflected as an increase to interest expense as a result of the prepayment in full of private placement notes in november 2010  results of operations                        fiscal2014     fiscal20131      fiscal2012    in millions                     sales

primarily influenced by sales and operating income margins            changes in the level of inventory            proportion of us sales made using inhouse customer financing programs and the average monthly collection rate of the credit balances            seasonal pattern of sales and            working capital movements associated with changes in store space  other sources of cash may include borrowings issuance of common shares for cash and securitization of signets us accounts receivable as contemplated in conjunction with the zale acquisition  net cash provided by operating activities  as a retail business signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card in the us division if the customer makes use of financing provided by signet the cash is received over a period of time in fiscal 2014 577 of the us divisions sales were made using customer financing provided by signet as compared to 569 in fiscal 2013 the average monthly collection rate from the us customer inhouse finance receivables was 121 as compared to 124 in fiscal 2013  signet typically pays for merchandise about 30 days after receipt due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately 12 months before it is sold in addition signet holds consignment inventory nearly all of which is in the us which at february 1 2014 amounted to 3126 million as compared to 2277 million at february 2 2013 the principal terms of the consignment agreements which can generally be terminated by either party are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties when signet sells consignment inventory it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies item 8    74    table of contents signets largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits these are typically paid on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis with annual bonus payments also being made operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the us division and on a quarterly basis by the uk division payment for advertising on television radio or in newspapers is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears other expenses none of which are material have various payment terms  signets working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to late november the peak level of working capital is typically 150 million above the typical january to august level and can be accentuated by new store openings the working capital position then reverses over the holiday season  the change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales changes in the sourcing practices commodity costs and merchandise mix of the business can also result in changes in inventory the value of inventory in the uk division is also impacted by movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate the change in us customer inhouse finance receivables proportionately reflect changes in sales if credit participation levels remain the same and receivable collection rates were unaltered changes in credit participation and the collection rate also impact the level of receivables movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of us sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales therefore if sales increase working capital would be expected to increase similarly a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capital  investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital as well as fixed capital investment due to the inventory turn and the additional investment required to fund sales in the us utilizing inhouse customer finance of the total investment required to open a new store in the us between 50 and 60 is typically accounted for by working capital new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact in addition the integration and conversion of ultra stores to kay stores in fiscal 2014 required investments in working and fixed capital  in fiscal 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 2355 million as compared to 3127 million in fiscal 2013 a decrease of 772 million net income increased by 81 million to 3680 million as compared to 3599 million in fiscal 2013 with depreciation and amortization increasing by 108 million to 1102 million as compared to 994 million in fiscal 2013 the primary drivers of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 were as follows            accounts receivable increased by 1683 million compared to an increase of 1171 million in fiscal 2013 reflecting higher sales a higher rate of inhouse customer finance a slightly lower collection rate and higher mix of customers selecting interest bearing accounts which do not require a down payment at onset            cash outflows associated with inventory increased to 984 million compared to an increased outflow of 657 million in fiscal 2013 while sales increased by 57 the change in inventory cash flows was driven by new store growth expansion of bridal programs the net impact of cash flow hedges and increased rough diamond inventory associated with managements strategic sourcing initiative offsetting these increases were management actions to improve inventory turns            accounts payable increased by 32 million compared to a decrease of 396 million in fiscal 2013 primarily related to higher inventory levels in fiscal 2014 and lower accounts payable in fiscal 2013 due primarily to payments for accelerated strategic inventory purchases that occurred in fiscal 2012    75    table of contents         other receivables and other assets increased by 216 million compared to an increase of 13 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in deferred extended service program costs and deferred compensation plan investments            income taxes payable increased by 79 million compared to an increase of 272 million in fiscal 2013 due to higher estimated tax payments made in fiscal 2014  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 due to the seasonal sales pattern accounts receivable increased by 2501 million as compared to an increase of 2074 million in the prior year fourth quarter and inventory decreased by 1739 million as compared to a decrease of 1421 million in the prior year fourth quarter  investing activities  investment activities primarily reflect the purchases of property plant and equipment related to the            rate of space expansion in the us            investment in existing stores reflecting the level of investment in salesenhancing technology and the number of store refurbishments and relocations carried out and            investment in divisional head offices systems and information technology software which include the us and uk distribution facilities  when evaluating new store investment management uses an investment hurdle rate of a 20 internal rate of return on a pretax basis over a five year period assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years capital expenditure accounts for about 45 of the investment in a new store in the us division the balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing signet typically carries out a major refurbishment of its stores every 10 years but does have some discretion as to the timing of such expenditure a major store refurbishment is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store minor store redecorations are typically carried out every five years in addition to major store refurbishments signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full refurbishment this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal where possible the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities  in fiscal 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 1604 million which includes 91 million for the acquisition of the diamond polishing factory partially offset by a working capital adjustment of 14 million related to the ultra acquisition compared to 1909 million in fiscal 2013 which included 567 million for the ultra acquisition the overall increase in capital additions was due to capital investment in the existing businesses in the us division capital additions in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were more than depreciation and amortization while in

sublet signet or one of its uk subsidiaries may be liable for those defaults the number of such claims arising to date has been small and the liability which is charged to the income statement as it arises has not been material  contractual obligations  a summary of operating lease obligations is set out below these primarily relate to minimum payments due under store lease arrangements the

taxes insurance and common area maintenance fees real estate taxes insurance and common area maintenance fees were approximately 35 of base rentals for fiscal 2014 these are not included in the table above some operating leases also require additional payments based on a percentage of sales    2 future pension obligations significantly decreased in fiscal 2013 based upon the most recent triannual actuarial valuation and revised deficit recovery plan  not included in the table above are obligations under employment agreements and ordinary course purchase orders for merchandise    80    table of contents impact of inflation  the impact of inflation on signets results for the past three years has not been significant apart from the impact of the commodity costs changes and in the uk the impact on merchandise costs due to the currency translation of the pound sterling against the us dollar  impact of climate change  signet recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce signets climatic impact management believes that climate change has a largely indirect influence on signets performance and that it is of limited significance to the business  critical accounting policies  critical accounting policies covering areas of greater complexity or those particularly subject to the exercise of judgment are listed below there are no material offbalance sheet structures the principal accounting policies are set out in the financial statements in item 8  deferred revenue recognition and returns  revenue from the sale of extended service plans is deferred and recognized over a 14 year period with approximately 45 recognized within the first two years representing the anticipated period of claims arising under the plans signet reviews the patterns of claims including estimates of future claims costs expected to be incurred to determine the appropriate deferral period for revenue recognition all direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized management reviews the trends in current and estimated future claims to assess whether changes are required to the revenue and cost recognition rates used  in connection with certain promotions signet gives customers making a purchase a voucher granting the customers a discount on a future purchase redeemable within a stated time frame signet accounts for such vouchers by allocating the fair value of the voucher between the initial purchase and the future purchase  the fair value of the voucher is determined based on the average sales transactions in which the vouchers were issued and the estimated average sales transactions when the vouchers are expected to be redeemed combined with the estimated voucher redemption rate the fair value allocated to the future purchase is recorded as deferred revenue  deferred revenue related to extended service plans voucher promotions and other items at the end of fiscal 2014 was 6167 million as compared to 5656 million in fiscal 2013  provision is made for future returns expected within the stated return period based on previous percentage return rates experienced  depreciation and impairment  property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation amortization and impairment losses maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred depreciation and amortization are provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows           buildings   30  40 years when land is owned or the remaining term of lease not to exceed 40 years   leasehold improvements   remaining term of lease not to exceed 10 years   furniture and fixtures   ranging from 3  10 years   equipment including software   ranging from 3  5 years    81    table of contents in the uk there are circumstances where refurbishments are carried out close to the end of the lease term such that the expected life of the newly installed leasehold improvements will exceed the lease term where the renewal of the lease is reasonably assured such storefronts fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period equal to the lesser of their economic useful life or the remaining lease term plus the period of reasonably assured renewal reasonable assurance is gained through evaluation of the right to enter into a new lease the performance of the store and potential availability of alternative sites  where appropriate impairments are recorded for the amount by which the assets have a fair value less than net book value management has identified potentially impaired assets considering the cash flows of individual stores where trading since the initial opening of the store has reached a mature stage where such stores deliver negative cash flows the related store assets have been considered for impairment by reference to estimated undiscounted future cash flows for these stores in fiscal 2014 the income statement includes a charge of 07 million for impairment of assets as compared to 26 million in fiscal 2013  taxation  accruals for income tax contingencies require management to make judgments and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and exposures amounts reserved are based on managements interpretation of jurisdictionspecific tax law and the likelihood of settlement tax benefits are not recognized unless the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained once recognized management reviews each material tax benefit taking account of potential settlement through negotiation andor litigation any recorded exposure to interest and penalties on tax liabilities is included in the income tax charge a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  accounts receivable  accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible balances this allowance is based on signets past experience and the payment history of customers which reflect the prevailing economic environment the allowance at february 1 2014 was 981 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of 14721 million this compares to an allowance of 883 million against a gross accounts receivable balance of 12936 million at february 2 2013 management regularly reviews its receivable balances and when it assesses that a balance is not recoverable it is fully provided for  interest earned from the us customer inhouse finance program is classified as other operating income  inventory valuation  inventories held in the us and uk divisions are valued on an average cost basis and includes appropriate overheads overheads allocated to inventory cost are only those directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition these include relevant warehousing distribution and certain buying security and data processing costs  inventories held in the companys diamond sourcing operations are valued at the lower of cost as determined on specific identification process or market  where necessary inventory is written down for obsolete slowmoving and damaged items this write down represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon inventory turn rates market conditions and trends in customer demand  in the us reserves for physical inventory losses are estimated and recorded throughout the year as a percentage of net sales based on historical physical inventory results expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels a physical inventory count is performed midyear and at the fiscal year end as a result of which    82    table of contents  the physical inventory reserves are adjusted for actual results in the uk inventory losses are recorded on a store by store basis based on historical cycle count results expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels these estimates are based on the overall divisional inventory loss experience since the last inventory count  the total inventory reserve at february 1 2014 was 163 million as compared to 234 million at february 2 2013 total net inventory at february 1 2014 was 14880 million an increase of 910 million from february 2 2013  hedge accounting  derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in the fair value of the derivatives being recognized immediately in current or comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge  changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in the consolidated income statements in the same periods and on the same financial statement line in which the hedged item affects net income  in the normal course of business the company may terminate cash flow hedges prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction for cash flow hedges terminated prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction management monitors the probability of the associated forecasted cash flow transactions to assess whether any gain or loss recorded in accumulated oci should be immediately recognized in net income  changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting together with any hedge ineffectiveness are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the consolidated income statements  uk retirement benefits  the expected liabilities of signets defined benefit pension plan the uk plan are calculated based primarily on assumptions regarding salary and pension increases inflation rates discount rates projected life expectancy and the longterm rate of return expected on the uk plans assets a full actuarial valuation was completed as of april 5 2012 and the uk plan valuation is updated at each year end the discount rate assumption of 45 applied for fiscal 2014 is based on the yield at the balance sheet date of long term aa rated corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the uk plans liabilities a 01 decrease in this discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension benefit of 05 million in fiscal 2014 by 04 million the value of the assets of the uk plan is measured as of the balance sheet date which is particularly dependent on the value of equity investments held at that date the overall impact on the consolidated balance sheet is significantly mitigated as the members of the uk plan are only in the uk and account for about 7 of uk employees the uk plan ceased to admit new employees as of april 2004 in addition if net accumulated actuarial gains and losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses that exceed this 10 over the average remaining service period of the employees the funded status of the uk plan at february 1 2014 was a 563 million asset as compared to a 485 million asset at february 2 2013  accounting changes and recent accounting standards  for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 x principal accounting policiesrecently issued accounting pronouncements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k    83    table of contents   item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  signet is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates certain commodity prices and interest rates  signet monitors and manages these market exposures as a fundamental part of its overall risk management program which recognizes the volatility of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects of this volatility on signets operating results  market risk management policy  a committee of the board is responsible for the implementation of market risk management policies within the treasury policies and guidelines framework which are deemed to be appropriate by the board for the management of market risk  signets exposure to market risk is managed by signets treasury committee consisting of signets chief executive officer chief financial officer and treasurer where deemed necessary to achieve the objective of reducing market risk volatility on signets operating results certain derivative instruments are entered into after review and approval by the treasury committee signet uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only  a description of signets accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 1 of item 8 signets current portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and for the purchase of gold forward purchase contracts and net zerocost collar arrangements an analysis quantifying the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by signet to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates is detailed in note 19 of item 8  foreign currency exchange rate risk  approximately 88 of signets total assets were held in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar at february 1 2014 and approximately 84 of its sales and 93 of its operating income in fiscal 2014 were generated in us dollars nearly all the remainder of signets assets sales and operating income are in pounds sterling  in translating the results of its uk operations signets results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar any depreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could increase reported revenues and operating profit and any appreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could decrease reported revenues and operating profit the board has chosen not to hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on signets operating results  the uk division buys certain products and materials on international markets that are priced in us dollars and therefore has an exposure to exchange rates on the cost of goods sold signet uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of this exposure within treasury guidelines approved by the board  signet holds a fluctuating amount of pounds sterling cash reflecting the cash generating characteristics of the uk division signets objective is to minimize net foreign exchange exposure to the income statement on pound sterling denominated items through managing this level of cash pound sterling denominated intercompany balances and us dollar to pound sterling swaps in order to manage the foreign exchange exposure and minimize the level of pound sterling cash held by signet the pound sterling denominated subsidiaries pay dividends regularly to their immediate holding companies and excess pounds sterling are sold in exchange for us dollars    84    table of contents commodity price risk  signets results are subject to fluctuations in the cost of diamonds gold and certain other precious metals which are key raw material components of the products sold by signet  it is signets policy to minimize the impact of precious metal commodity price volatility on operating results through the use of forward purchases of or by entering into either purchase options or net zerocost collar arrangements within treasury guidelines approved by the board  interest rate risk  signets interest income or expense is exposed to volatility in interest rates this exposure is driven by both the currency denomination of the cash or debt the mix of fixed and floating rate debt used the type of cash investments and the total amount of cash and debt outstanding  sensitivity analysis  management has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of signets financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates as shown in the table below  fair value changes arising from                            in millions   fair valuefebruary 12014     1 rise ininterest rates     10depreciation of against

rate borrowings                                          the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis quantify the impact of market risk assuming that certain adverse market conditions specified in the table above occur they are not forwardlooking estimates of market risk actual results in the future are likely to differ materially from those projected due to changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and actual developments in the global financial markets  any changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and developments in the global financial markets may cause fluctuations in interest rates exchange rates and precious metal prices to exceed the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table above the sensitivity scenarios are intended to allow an expected risk measure to be applied to the scenarios as opposed to the scenarios themselves being an indicator of the maximum expected risk  the fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on market value equivalents at period end taking into account the current interest rate environment current foreign currency forward rates or current commodity forward rates  the estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an increase of 1 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at february 1 2014 with all other variables remaining constant  the estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against pound sterling from the levels applicable at february 1 2014 with all other variables remaining constant    85    table of contents   item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  report

value is less than its carrying value the annual testing date for reporting units within the us and uk segments is the last day of the fourth quarter  the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then the reporting units fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is determined through the income approach using discounted cash flow models or marketbased methodologies significant estimates used in these discounted cash flow models include the weighted average cost of capital longterm growth rates expected changes to selling prices direct costs and profitability of the business and working capital requirements management estimates discount rates using posttax rates that reflect assessments of the time value of money and companyspecific risks if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the company

completion and costs to be incurred in marketing selling and distribution inventory writedowns are recorded for obsolete slow moving or defective items and shrinkage the writedown is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates future demand management strategy and market conditions shrinkage is estimated and recorded based on historical physical inventory results expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and distribution centers  inventories held in the companys diamond sourcing operations are valued at the lower of cost as determined on specific identification process or market    95    table of contents k vendor contributions  contributions are received from vendors through various programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising where vendor contributions related to identifiable promotional events are received these are matched against the costs of these promotions vendor contributions which are received as general contributions and not related to specific

merchandise purchases from the us divisions stores signet recognizes finance charges in accordance with the contractual agreements gross interest earned is recorded as other operating income in the income statement see note 3 in addition to interestbearing accounts a significant proportion of credit sales are made using interestfree financing for one year or less subject to certain conditions  accrual of interest is suspended when accounts become more than 90 days aged upon suspension of the accrual of interest interest income is subsequently recognized to the extent cash payments are received accrual of interest is resumed when receivables are removed from nonaccrual status  m accounts receivable  accounts receivable are stated at their nominal amounts and primarily include account balances outstanding from signets inhouse customer finance programs the finance receivables from the inhouse customer finance programs are comprised of a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance the initial acceptance of customer finance arrangements is based on proprietary consumer credit scores subsequent to the initial finance purchase signet monitors the credit quality of its customer finance receivable portfolio based on payment activity that drives the aging of receivables this credit quality indicator is assessed on a realtime basis by signet  accounts receivable under the customer finance programs are shown net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts see note 10 this allowance is an estimate of the losses as of the balance sheet date and is calculated using a proprietary model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those amounts 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analyses are required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio  allowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the income statement receivables are charged off to the allowance when amounts become more than 120 days aged on the recency method and more than 240 days aged on the contractual method see note 10  n leases  assets held under capital leases relate to leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have passed to signet all other leases are defined as operating leases where operating leases include predetermined rent increases those rents are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term including any construction period or other rental holiday other amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred premiums paid to acquire shortterm leasehold properties and inducements to enter into a lease are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term  certain leases provide for contingent rentals that are not measurable at inception these contingent rentals are primarily based on a percentage of sales in excess of a predetermined level these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable    96    table of contents o income taxes  income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  at any point in time various tax years are subject to or are in the process of audit by various taxing authorities to the extent that managements estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made  p employee benefits  signet operates a defined benefit pension plan in the uk the uk plan which ceased to admit new employees effective april 2004 the uk plan provides benefits to participating eligible employees beginning in fiscal 2014 a change to the benefit structure was implemented and members benefits that accumulate after that date are now based upon career average salaries whereas previously all benefits were based on salaries at retirement the uk plans assets are held by the uk plan  the net periodic pension cost of the uk plan is measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee attrition gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions if such gains or losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of the employees  the net periodic pension cost is charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement  the funded status of the uk plan is recognized on the balance sheet and is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation measured at the balance sheet date any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not included as components of net periodic pension cost are recognized net of tax in the period within other comprehensive loss income  signet also operates a defined contribution pension plan in the uk and sponsors a defined contribution 401k retirement savings plan in the us contributions made by signet to these pension arrangements are charged primarily to selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement as incurred  q derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  signet enters into various types of derivative instruments to mitigate certain risk exposures related to changes in commodity costs and foreign exchange rates derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities with an offset to current or comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge  if a derivative instrument meets certain hedge accounting criteria it may be designated as a cash flow hedge on the date it is entered into a cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset liability or a forecasted transaction for cash flow hedge transactions the effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives is recognized directly in equity as a component of accumulated oci and is recognized in the consolidated income statements in the same periods and on the same financial statement    97    table of contents  line in which the hedged item affects net income amounts excluded from the effectiveness calculation and any ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized immediately in other operating income net in the consolidated income statements in addition gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in other operating income net  in the normal course of business the company may terminate cash flow hedges prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction for cash flow hedges terminated prior to the occurrence of the underlying forecasted transaction management monitors the probability of the associated forecasted cash flow transactions to assess whether any gain or loss recorded in accumulated oci should be immediately recognized in net income  cash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities  r cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand money market deposits and amounts placed with external fund managers with an original maturity of three months or less and are carried at cost which approximates fair value in addition receivables from thirdparty credit card issuers typically converted to cash within 5 days of the original sales transaction are considered cash equivalents  s borrowing costs  borrowings comprise interest bearing bank loans and bank overdrafts borrowing costs are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the contractual term of the related loan  t sharebased compensation  signet measures sharebased compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost as an expense on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period of employees certain of signets share plans include a condition whereby vesting is contingent on growth exceeding a given target and therefore awards granted with this condition are considered to be performancebased awards  signet estimates fair value using a blackscholes model for awards granted under the omnibus plan as defined in note 23 below and the binomial valuation model for awards granted under the share saving plans as defined in note 23 below deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on the income tax returns of subsidiaries are recorded by signet based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the subsidiaries statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a deduction differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the subsidiaries income tax return are recorded in additional paidincapital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the income statement if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paidincapital exists from previous awards  sharebased compensation is primarily recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement along with the relevant salary cost  see note 23 for a further description of signets sharebased compensation plans  u contingent liabilities  provisions for contingent liabilities are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss  when it is reasonably possible that a contingent liability may result in a loss or additional loss the range of the loss is disclosed    98    table of contents v common shares  when new shares are issued they are recorded in common shares at their par value the excess of the issue price over the par value
