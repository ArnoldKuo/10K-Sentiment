midmarketbest in bridalbest in class digital ecosystemexpand footprintpeople purpose and passionthese strategic pillars guide signet in building profitable market share maximizing the midmarket drives our competitive strengths focused on merchandising initiatives marketing store growth and productivity we define the midmarket jewelry sector based on the value of products that consumers purchase we consider this market to be defined by jewelry purchases with price points ranging from 100 to 10000 which essentially excludes costume and luxury jewelry categories the vast majority of signets sales 95 are in this range of price points this subset of the total us jewelry market is 412 billion or over half the total us market in pursuit of this strategic pillar we continuously review our us national store brands performance and have concluded that our customer population has several distinct shopping and purchasing characteristics or customer identities consequently we attempt to maximize our share of the midmarket by differentiating customers based on attitudes and behaviors versus demographic information this approach to customer segmentation results in distinct customer identitiesthe sentimentalist  a seeker of highquality timeless jewelry which invokes sentimental valuethe gifter  a customer that is not highly knowledgeable of jewelry but purchases for others 4table of contentsthe influencer  a customer that uses jewelry to show status and is knowledgeable of brands the influencer is a customer focused on both selfpurchase and gifting the stylish shopper  a customer that wears jewelry often and considers it an essential aspect of fashionthe practical shopper  a customer that focuses on inexpensive everyday jewelryalthough each of our us national store brand customers share many of these five customer traits each store brand attracts a heavier weighting of certain types of customers this customer segmentation approach empowers signet to define our highestpriority growth opportunities within the midmarket ie where signet will play to differentiate and optimize our store brands including guest experience merchandise brands and marketingour brand discussion included within item 1 includes alignment of these customer identities with our us national store brandsbeing the best in bridal is an ongoing journey not a destination in jewelry bridal

experience by our sales associates advancing vertical integration in our supply chain and offering credit financing our omnichannel approach to educating selling and serving of customers is uniquely important in jewelry retail because the purchase of jewelry is personal intimate and typically viewed as an important experience the internet often represents the first interaction a customer or prospective guest will have with us when a jewelrybuying occasion arises as trust is the most important factor in why people buy jewelry where they do customers overwhelmingly complete their purchases in our stores with our trusted knowledgeable sales associates enhancing our digital ecosystem and simplifying and accelerating our guests engagement with our brands is a crucial step of our omnichannel approach expanding our geographic footprint is expected to enable crosscollaboration among and between our domestic and international teams and further growth and diversification of our

branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise sectorleading advertising diversified real estate portfolio supply chain leadership customer finance programs and financial strength and flexibility operational strategyin setting financial objectives for fiscal 2017 consideration was given to several factors including the zale integration signets vision 2020 strategy and the economic environments in which the company does business the economies of the us canada and uk have improved slightly over the past year due to relatively low unemployment inflation interest rates and energy prices offset by higher food and health care costs and higher consumer savings certain sectors of the us and canadian economies have declined during fiscal 2016 including the oil amp gas industry we believe this decline has had a disproportionate impact within our zale jewelry segment due to the concentration of retail locations within affected regions such as edmonton calgary the dakotas region southern saskatoon north dakota and western colorado west texas and the houston regionsignet will execute on its strategic priorities and continue to make strategic investments for the future the cost of diamonds signets most significant input cost is currently expected to increase at lowtomid single digit rates consumer credit is important for signet signet takes a hybrid approach to credit by assuming the risk and reward of owning inhouse accounts receivable for its sterling jewelers division while primarily using third party financing programs for its other divisions financing will

strives to continually improve the quality of the guest experience therefore the ability to recruit develop and retain qualified sales associates is an important element in enhancing guest satisfaction we have in place comprehensive recruitment training and incentive programs we use employee and guest satisfaction metrics to monitor and improve performance as well as conducting an annual flagship training conference ahead of the holiday seasondigital ecosystemas a specialty jeweler signets business differs from many other retailers such that a purchase of merchandise from any of signets stores is personal intimate and typically viewed as an important experience due to this dynamic guests often invest time on signet websites and social media to experience the merchandise assortments prior to visiting brickandmortar stores to execute a purchase transaction at times particularly related to high value transactions guests will supplement their online experience with an instore visit prior to finalizing a fashion or giftgiving decision distinguishing whether the companys performance is driven by the initial exposure to the online assortment versus the merchandising and experience with instore professionals is not a primary focus of management as electronic efforts are a support channel for all store brandsthrough signets websites we educate our customers and provide guests with a source of information on products and brands merchandise available as well as the ability to buy online our websites are integrated with each divisions stores so that merchandise ordered online may be picked up at a store or delivered to the guest our websites make an important and growing contribution to the guest experience as well as to each divisions marketing programs in recent years significant investments and initiatives have been completed to drive sales growth these investments includeoptimization of brand websites for both desktop and mobile devices with improved functionality in product search and navigationincreased merchandise assortmentinvestments in social media including facebook instagram and twitter as well as a youtube channel andimprovements in store broadband to enhance instore ecommerce salessignets supplier relationships allow it to display suppliers inventories on the brand websites for sale to guests without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by guests which are referred to as virtual inventory virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to guests both online and instore 9table of contentsraw materials the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a much lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones diamonds account for about 45 and gold about 14 of signets cost of merchandise sold respectivelysignet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of net zerocost collar arrangements forward contracts and commodity purchasing it is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds the cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry with labor costs also being a significant factor diamond sourcingsignet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and to a smaller extent as loose cutandpolished stones and rough stonesfinished jewelrymerchandise is purchased as finished product where the items are relatively more complex have less predictable sales patterns or where it is cost effective to do so this method of buying inventory provides the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers thereby reducing the risk of over or underpurchasing signets scale strong balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable termsloose diamondssignet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets eg india israel from a variety of sources eg polishers traders signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers using third parties and inhouse resources by using these approaches the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling signet to provide better value to guests buying loose diamonds helps allow signets buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and in turn leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished productsrough diamondssignet continues to take steps to advance its vertical integration which includes rough diamond sourcing and manufacturing signets objective with this initiative is to secure additional reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for guests of all divisions while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain in fiscal 2014 signet acquired a diamond polishing factory in gaborone botswana and established a diamond buying office in india in fiscal 2015 signet was appointed a sightholder by debeers which further increased signets supply of rough diamonds as of fiscal 2016 signet has contracted allocations of rough diamonds with rio tinto debeers and alrosa these developments in signets longterm diamond sourcing capabilities allow signet to buy rough diamonds directly from the miners and then have the stones marked cut and polished in its own polishing facility any stones deemed unsuitable for signets needs are sold to third parties with the objective of recovering the original cost of the stones signets sourcing initiative is primarily focused on supplying the diamond needs of the sterling jewelers division and has since been expanded to include all

financing program these factors include a high average transaction value a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise primarily in the bridal category and the minimum scale necessary to administer credit programs efficiently in addition our credit program provides other benefits to our business overall including complementing our best in bridal strategy in that 50 of

on the balance sheet and there are no associated offbalance sheet arrangements in addition to interestbearing transactions that involve the use of inhouse customer finance a portion of credit sales are made using interestfree financing for one year subject to certain conditions in most us states guests also are offered optional thirdparty credit insuranceunderwritingthe majority of credit applications originate in one of our retail locations and are approved or denied automatically based on proprietary origination models origination and purchase authorization strategies are designed by a dedicated risk management team which is separate and distinct from our retail sales organization ensuring that financing decisions are not influenced by sales driven objectives our underwriting process considers one or more of the following elements credit bureau information income and address verification current income and debt levels we have developed and refined proprietary statistical models that provide standardized credit decisions and drive the optimization of credit limit assignment down payment requirements and more significant debt service requirements as compared to general consumer lending standards for certain credit applicants that may have past credit problems or lack credit history we use stricter underwriting criteria these additional requirements may include items such as verification of employment and minimum down payment levels part of our ability to control delinquency and net chargeoffs is based on the level of required down payments tailored credit limits and more significant debt service requirements as mentioned above underwriting risk tolerance has not been altered in the past 10 years several factors can influence portfolio risk outside of the initial origination and subsequent authorization decisions including macroeconomic conditions regulatory environment operational system stability and strategy execution store execution and the ability of marketing and prospecting activities to attract a consistent risk weighed mix of new applicants to the receivable the scores of fair isaac corporation fico a widelyused financial metric for

credit to guests of the individual store are included in the projections used when considering store investment proposalsportfolio agingsince inception of its inhouse financing signet measures delinquency and establishes loss allowances using a form of the recency method this form of the recency method relies upon qualifying payments determined by management to measure delinquency in general an account will not remain current unless a qualifying payment is received a customer is aged to the next delinquency level if they fail to make a qualifying payment by their monthly aging a customers account ages each month five days after their due date listed on their statement allowing for a grace period before collection efforts begin a qualifying payment can be no less than 75 of the scheduled payment increasing with the delinquency level if an account holder is two payments behind then they must make a full minimum payment to return to current status if an account holder is three payments behind then they must make three full payments before returning to a current status if an account holder is more than three payments behind then the entire past due amount is required to return to a current status establishing qualifying payment methods in accounting for delinquencies is appropriate considering the high minimum payments that are required of customers the weighted average minimum payment required as a percentage of the outstanding balance was 9 at year end fiscal 2016 the minimum payment does not decline as the balance declines these two facts combined higher scheduled payment requirement and no decline in payment requirement as balance decreases allow signet to collect on the receivable significantly faster than other retailbank card accounts which require a 35 minimum payment reducing risk and more quickly freeing up customer open to buy for additional purchases of all payments received in the fiscal year 97 were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment compared to 97 last year while guests can make payments through online or mobile channels via telephone or through the mail 25 of payments are made in one of our retail locationssee note 1 of item 8 for additional information regarding qualifying paymentsallowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of goods sold in the income statement the allowance is calculated using a model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates an allowance for amounts 90 days aged and under on a recency basis is established based on historical loss experience and payment performance information a 100 allowance is made for any amount aged more than 90 days on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy an account is 90 days aged on a recency basis when there has not been a qualifying payment made within 90 days of the billing date the net bad debt expensed on the income statement is equal to the sum of the total change in the allowance for uncollectible accounts and the total amount of charged off balances less any recoveries for accounts previously charged off the allowance calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analysis is required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfoliowe deem accounts to be uncollectible and charge off when the account is both more than 120 days aged on a recency basis and 240 days aged on a contractual basis at the end of a month over the last 12 months we have recovered 18 of chargedoff amounts through our collection activities and the sale of previously charged off accounts we track our chargeoffs both gross before recoveries and net after

discretionary and is affected by general economic conditions therefore a decline in consumer spending may unfavorably impact signets future sales and earningsjewelry purchases are discretionary and are dependent on consumers perceptions of general economic conditions particularly as jewelry is often perceived to be a luxury purchase adverse changes in the economy and periods when discretionary spending by consumers may be under pressure could unfavorably impact sales and earnings we may respond by increasing discounts or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and operating resultsthe success of signets operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers consumer confidence level of customer traffic in shopping malls and other retail centers employment the level of consumers disposable income business conditions interest rates consumer debt and asset values availability of credit and levels of taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operateas 11 of signets sales are accounted for by its uk jewelry division economic conditions in the eurozone have a significant impact on the uk economy even though the uk is not a member of the eurozone therefore developments in the eurozone could adversely impact trading in the uk jewelry division as well as adversely impact the us economy in addition the uk may seek to leave the european union eu and adopt an as yet unknown relationship with the eu if this occurred it could affect economic or market conditions throughout europe and beyond and could contribute to instability in global credit markets any such exit by the uk from the eu could have a material adverse affect on signetmore than half of sales in the sterling jewelers division and approximately 40 of sales in the zale division are made utilizing customer financing provided or facilitated by signet therefore any deterioration in consumers financial position or changes to the regulatory requirements regarding the granting of credit to customers could adversely impact sales earnings and the collectability of accounts receivable more than half of signets sales in the us and canada utilize its inhouse or thirdparty customer financing programs and an additional 25 of purchases are made using third party bank cards any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increase in consumer debt levels may inhibit consumers use of credit and decrease consumers ability to satisfy signets requirement for access to customer finance and could in turn have an adverse effect on the companys sales furthermore any downturn in general or local economic conditions in particular an increase in unemployment in the markets in which the signet operates may adversely affect its collection of outstanding accounts receivable its net bad debt charge and hence earningsadditionally signets ability to extend credit to customers and the terms on which it is achieved depends on many factors including compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the us and canada any of which may change from time to time and such changes could adversely affect sales and income in addition other restrictions arising from applicable law could cause limitations in credit terms currently offered or a reduction in the level of credit granted by the company or by third parties and this could adversely impact sales income or cash flowthe us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the doddfrank act created a bureau of consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking and supervisory authority for a wide range of consumer financial services including signets customer financing programs the bureaus authority became effective in july 2011 any new regulatory initiatives by the bureau could impose additional costs andor restrictions on credit practices of the sterling jewelers and zale divisions which could adversely affect their ability to conduct its businesssignets share price may be volatilesignets share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in the actual or anticipated results and financial conditions of signet and other companies in the retail industry and the stock markets view of the acquisition of zale corporation in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companiessignet provides public guidance on its expected operating and financial results for future periods although signet believes that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to its stockholders and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements signets actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the provided guidance or the expectations of our investors and analysts especially in times of economic uncertainty in the past when the company has reduced its previously provided guidance the market price of signets common stock has declined if in the future signets operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of our investors and analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may declinein addition signet may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or of analysts at some time in the future if the analysts that regularly follow the companys stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the companys stock price could decline 26table of contentsthe concentration of a significant proportion of sales and an even larger share of profits in the fourth quarter means results are dependent on performance during that periodsignets business is highly seasonal with a significant proportion of its sales and operating profit generated during its fourth quarter which includes the holiday season management expects to continue to experience a seasonal fluctuation in its sales and earnings therefore there is limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in its operations and strategies in other quarters or to recover from any extensive disruption for example due to sudden adverse changes in consumer confidence inclement weather conditions having an impact on a significant number of stores in the last few days immediately before christmas day or disruption to warehousing and store replenishment systems a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any fiscal year would therefore be expected to have a material adverse effect on the annual results of operations disruption at lesser peaks in sales at valentines day and mothers day would be expected to impact the results to a lesser extent additionally in anticipation of increased sales activity in the holiday season signet incurs certain significant incremental expenses prior to and during peak selling seasons including advertising and costs associated with hiring a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforcedeterioration in our capital structure or financial performance could result in constraints on capital or financial covenant breaches in addition a portion of the companys debt is variable rate and volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultswhile signet has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its operating requirements the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in signets capital structure or the quality and stability of earnings could result in a downgrade of signets credit rating any negative ratings actions could also constrain the capital available to the company could limit the companys access to funding for its operations funding dividends and share repurchases and increase the companys financing costs changes in general credit market conditions could also affect signets ability to access capital rates at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally as a result of the companys exposure to variable interest rate debt volatility in benchmark interest rates could adversely impact the companys financial resultssignets borrowing agreements include various financial covenants and operating restrictions a material deterioration in its financial performance could result in a covenant being breached if signet were to breach or believed it was going to breach a financial covenant it would have to renegotiate its terms with current lenders or find alternative sources of financing if current lenders required cancellation of facilities or early repaymentmovements in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact the results and balance sheet of signetsignet publishes its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars at january 30 2016 signet held approximately 83 of its total assets in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar and generated approximately 85 of its sales and 92 of its operating income in us dollars for the fiscal year then ended all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in uk british pounds and canadian dollars therefore its results and balance sheet are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and both the british pound and canadian dollar accordingly any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would decrease reported sales and operating incomethe monthly average exchange rates are used to prepare the income statement and are calculated each month from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk jewelry division and the canadian subsidiaries of the zale divisionwhere british pounds or canadian dollars are held or used to fund the cash flow requirements of the business any decrease in the weighted average value of the british pound or canadian dollar against the us dollar would reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalentsin addition the prices of certain materials and products bought on the international markets by signet are denominated in foreign currencies as a result signet and its subsidiaries have exposures to exchange rate fluctuations on its cost of goods sold as well as volatility of input prices if foreign manufacturers and suppliers are impacted by exchange rate fluctuationsfluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities particularly polished diamonds and gold which account for the majority of signets merchandise costs could adversely impact its earnings and cash availabilitythe jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones in particular diamonds accounted for about 45 and gold about 14 of signets merchandise costs in fiscal 2016in fiscal 2016 prices for the assortment of polished diamonds utilized by signet were relatively flat with prior year industry forecasts indicate that over the medium and longer term the demand for diamonds will probably increase faster than the growth in supply particularly as a result of growing demand in countries such as china and india therefore the cost of diamonds is anticipated to rise over time although fluctuations in price are likely to continue to occur the mining production and inventory policies followed by major producers of rough diamonds can have a significant impact on diamond prices as can the inventory and buying patterns of jewelry retailers and other parties in the supply chain27table of contentswhile jewelry manufacturing is the major final demand for gold management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly impacted by investment transactions which have resulted in significant volatility in the gold price in recent years including a decline during fiscal 2016 signets cost of merchandise and potentially its earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly escalatethe availability of diamonds is significantly influenced by the political situation in diamond producing countries and by the kimberley process an intergovernmental agreement for the international trading of rough diamonds until acceptable alternative sources of diamonds can be developed any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from significant producing countries or to the trading in rough and polished diamonds which could occur as a result of disruption to the kimberley process could adversely affect signet as well as the retail jewelry market as a whole in addition the current kimberley process decision making procedure is dependent on reaching a consensus among member governments which can result in the protracted resolution of issues and there is little expectation of significant reform over the longterm the impact of this review process on the supply of diamonds and consumers perception of the diamond supply chain is unknown in addition to the kimberley process the supply of diamonds to the us is also impacted by certain governmental trade sanctions imposed on zimbabwethe possibility of constraints in the supply of diamonds of a size and quality signet requires to meet its merchandising requirements may result in changes in signets supply chain practices for example its rough sourcing initiative in addition signet may from time to time choose to hold more inventory purchase raw materials at an earlier stage in the supply chain or enter into commercial agreements of a nature that it currently does not use such actions could require the investment of cash andor additional management skills such actions may not result in the expected returns and other projected benefits anticipated by managementan inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability historically jewelry retailers have been able over time to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs however in general particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices as signet uses an average cost inventory methodology volatility in its commodity costs may also result in a time lag before cost increases are reflected in retail prices there is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur in addition any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customerin august 2012 the sec pursuant to the doddfrank act issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the gold supply chain is complex and while management believes that the rules currently cover less than 1 of annual worldwide gold production based upon recent estimates the final rules require signet and other affected companies that file with the sec to make specified country of origin inquiries of our suppliers and otherwise to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin and certain other information relating to any of the statutorily designated minerals gold tin tantalum and tungsten that are used in products sold by signet in the us and elsewhere on may 28 2015 signet filed with the sec its form specialized disclosure sd and accompanying conflict minerals report in accordance with the secs rules which together describe our country of origin inquiries and due diligence measures relating to the source and chain of custody of those designated minerals signet deemed necessary to the functionality or production of our products the results of those activities and our related determinations with respect to the calendar year ended december 31 2014there may be reputational risks associated with the potential negative response of our customers and other stakeholders to future disclosures by signet in the event that due to the complexity of the global supply chain signet is unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the relevant metals also if future responses to verification requests by suppliers of any of the covered minerals used in our products are inadequate or adverse signets ability to obtain merchandise may be impaired and our compliance costs may increase the final rules also cover tungsten and tin which are contained in a small proportion of items that are sold by signet it is possible that other minerals such as diamonds could be subject to similar rulesprice increases may have an adverse impact on signets performanceif significant price increases are implemented by any division or across a wide range of merchandise the impact on earnings will depend on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products in the same geographic area and the response by customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower sales and adversely impact earningssignets competitors are specialty jewelry retailers as well as other jewelry retailers including department stores mass merchandisers discount stores apparel and accessory fashion stores brand retailers shopping clubs home shopping television channels direct home sellers online retailers and auction sites in addition other retail categories and other forms of expenditure such as electronics and travel also compete for consumers discretionary expenditure particularly during the holiday gift giving season therefore the price of jewelry relative to other products influences the proportion of consumers expenditure that is spent on jewelry if the relative price of jewelry increases signets sales and earnings may decline28table of contentsthe failure to satisfy the accounting requirements for hedge accounting or default or insolvency of a counterparty to a hedging contract could adversely impact resultssignet hedges a portion of its purchases of gold for both its sterling jewelers and uk jewelry divisions and hedges the us dollar requirements of its uk jewelry division the failure to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate accounting requirements or a default or insolvency of a counterparty to a contract could increase the volatility of results and may impact the timing of recognition of gains and losses in the income statementthe inability of signet to obtain merchandise that customers wish to purchase particularly ahead of and during the fourth quarter would adversely impact salesthe abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the fourth quarter could result in a material adverse effect on signets businessalso if management misjudges expected customer demand or fails to identify changes in customer demand andor its supply chain does not respond in a timely manner it could adversely impact signets results by causing either a shortage of merchandise or an accumulation of excess inventorysignet benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results management holds regular reviews with major suppliers signets most significant supplier accounts for 39 of merchandise government requirements regarding sources of commodities such as those required by the doddfrank act could result in signet choosing to terminate relationships with suppliers in the future due to a change in a suppliers sourcing practices or signets compliance with laws and internal policiesluxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies the right to sell their ranges on a storebystore basis the watch brands sold by ernest jones and to a lesser extent jared help attract customers and build sales in all categories therefore an inability to obtain or retain watch agencies for a location could harm the performance of that particular store in the case of ernest jones the inability to gain additional prestige watch agencies is an important factor in and may reduce the likelihood of opening new stores which could adversely impact sales growththe growth in importance of branded merchandise within the jewelry market may adversely impact signets sales and earnings if it is unable to obtain supplies of branded merchandise that the customer wishes to purchase in addition if signet loses the distribution rights to an important branded jewelry range it could adversely impact sales and earningssignet has had success in recent years in the development of branded merchandise that is exclusive to its stores if signet is not able to further develop such branded merchandise or is unable to successfully develop further such initiatives it may adversely impact sales and earningsan inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsmanagement regards the customer experience as an essential element in the success of its business competition for suitable individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs therefore an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earningsloss of confidence by consumers in signets brand names poor execution of marketing programs and reduced marketing expenditure could have a detrimental impact on salesprimary factors in determining customer buying decisions in the jewelry sector include customer confidence in the retailer and in the brands it sells together with the level and quality of customer service the ability to differentiate signets stores and merchandise from competitors by its branding marketing and advertising programs is an important factor in attracting consumers if these programs are poorly executed the level of support for them is reduced or the customer loses confidence in any of signets brands for whatever reason it could unfavorably impact sales and earningslongterm changes in consumer attitudes to jewelry could be unfavorable and harm jewelry salesconsumer attitudes to diamonds gold and other precious metals and gemstones also influence the level of signets sales attitudes could be affected by a variety of issues including concern over the source of raw materials the impact of mining and refining of minerals on the environment the local community and the political stability of the producing country labor conditions in the supply chain and the availability of and consumer attitudes to substitute products such as cubic zirconia moissanite and laboratory created diamonds a negative change in consumer attitudes to jewelry could adversely impact sales and earningsthe retail jewelry industry is highly fragmented and competitive aggressive discounting by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short termthe retail jewelry industry is competitive if signets competitive position deteriorates operating results or financial condition could be adversely affectedaggressive discounting by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short term this is particularly the case for easily comparable pieces of jewelry of similar quality sold through stores that are situated near to those that signet operates29table of contentssignet faces significant competition from independent and regional specialty jewelry retailers that are able to adjust their competitive stance for example on pricing to local market conditions this can put individual signet stores at a competitive disadvantage as signet divisions have a national pricing strategythe inability to rent stores that satisfy managements operational and financial criteria could harm sales as could changes in locations where customers shop signets results are dependent on a number of factors relating to its stores these include the availability of desirable property the demographic characteristics of the area around the store the design and maintenance of the stores the availability of attractive locations within the shopping center that also meet the operational and financial criteria of management the terms of leases and signets relationship with major landlords if signet is unable to rent stores that satisfy its operational and financial criteria or if there is a disruption in its relationship with its major landlords sales could be adversely affectedgiven the length of property leases that signet enters into it is dependent upon the continued popularity of particular retail locations as signet tests and develops new types of store locations and designs there is no certainty as to their success the majority of longterm space growth opportunities in the us are in new developments and therefore future store space is in part dependent on the investment by real estate developers in new projects limited new real estate development taking place would make it challenging to identify and secure suitable new store locations the uk jewelry division has a more diverse range of store locations than in the us or canada including some exposure to smaller retail centers which do not justify the investment required to refurbish the site to the current store format consequently the uk jewelry

merchandise costs principally diamonds changes in nonmerchandise components of cost of sales as described above changes in sales mix foreign exchange gold and currency hedges and the economics of services such as repairs and extended service plans the price of diamonds varies depending on their size cut color and clarity demand for diamonds is primarily driven by the manufacture and sale of diamond jewelry and their future price is uncertain at times signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to the us dollar exchange rate but it is not able to do so for diamonds for gold and currencies the hedging period can extend to 24 months although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum

jewelry inventory turns slowly the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes time to be fully reflected in the gross margin signets inventory turns faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters therefore changes in the cost of merchandise are more quickly reflected in the gross margin in that quarter furthermore signets hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin an increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross

administrative costs as well as advertising and promotional costs it also includes field support center expenses such as information technology credit finance ecommerce and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statementsthe primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees employed and the level of compensation taxes and other benefits paid management varies on a store by store basis the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store nonstore staffing levels are less variable a significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales and operating profitthe level of advertising expenditure can vary the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by managements judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media53table of contentsother operating incomeother operating income is predominantly interest income arising from inhouse customer finance provided to the customers of the sterling jewelers division its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged the credit program selected by the customer and the level of outstanding balances the level of outstanding balances is primarily dependent on the sales of the sterling jewelers division the proportion of sales that use the inhouse customer finance and the monthly collection rateoperating incometo maintain current levels of operating income signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin any increase in operating costs the impact of any immature selling space and any adverse changes in other operating income same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income when foreseen signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions the acquisition of zale with operating margins lower than that of signet caused an overall lower operating margin for signet the impact on operating income of a sharp unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance can be significant this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business in the medium term there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level but the time it takes varies depending on the type of cost an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter additionally while signet has improved flexibility involving lease costs in recent years as offmall locations have increased signets ability to adjust base lease costs is stll limited in the short term and to a lesser extent the medium term as leases

accrued expenses including variable compensation anddeferred revenue reflective of the performance of extended service plan salesother sources of cash include borrowings issuance of common shares for cash and proceeds from the securitization facility relating to signets sterling jewelers finance receivablesnet cash provided by operating activities signet derives most of its operating cash from net income through the sale of jewelry as a retail business signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by signet or the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card partially offsetting cash via sales are operating expenses signets largest operating expenses are payroll and related payroll benefits working capitalchanges to accounts receivable are driven by the sterling jewelers division inhouse credit program if a customer makes use of financing provided by the sterling jewelers division the cash is received over time based on terms of the agreement in fiscal 2016 615 of the sterling jewelers divisions sales were made using customer financing provided by signet as compared to 605 in fiscal 2015 the average monthly collection rate from the sterling jewelers customer inhouse finance receivables was 115 as compared to 119 in fiscal 2015 changes in credit participation and the collection rate impact the level of receivableschanges to accounts payable are primarily driven by the timing and amount of merchandise purchased the mix of merchandise purchased and the relevant payment terms signet typically pays for merchandise within 30 days of receipt due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately 12 months before it is sold signets working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the british pound and canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to latenovember the peak level of working capital is typically 100 million to 150 million above the typical january to august level and can be accentuated by new store openings the working capital position then reverses over the holiday season70table of contentsthe change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales other factors which drive changes to inventory include changes in sourcing practices commodity costs foreign exchange and merchandise mix to further enhance product selection test new jewelry designs and working capital levels signet utilizes consignment inventory the majority of consignment inventory is held in the us which at january 30 2016 amounted to 4419 million as compared to 4346 million at january 31 2015 the principal terms of the consignment agreements which can generally be terminated by either party are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties when signet sells consignment inventory it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies item 8 signets working capital is also impacted by movements in deferred revenue associated with the sales of extended service plans sold in sterling jewelers and zale divisions movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of divisional sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales therefore if sales increase working capital would be expected to increase similarly a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capitalsignets largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits these are typically paid on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis with annual bonus payments also being made operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the sterling jewelers and zale divisions and on a quarterly basis by the uk jewelry division payment for advertising on television radio or in newspapers is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears other expenses none of which are material have various payment termsinvestment in new space requires significant investment in working capital as well as fixed capital investment due to the inventory turn and the additional investment required to fund sales in the sterling jewelers and zale divisions utilizing inhouse customer finance of the total investment required to open a new store in the us between 50 and 60 is typically accounted for by working capital new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact fiscal 2016 cash flow resultsin fiscal 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 4433 million as compared to 2830 million in fiscal 2015 an increase of 1603 million net income increased by 866 million to 4679 million as compared to 3813 million in fiscal 2015 with depreciation and amortization increasing by 256 million to 1753 million as compared to 1497 million in fiscal 2015 the primary drivers of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 were as followscash used for accounts receivable was 1898 million compared to 1946 million in fiscal 2015 reflecting higher credit sales and a higher credit penetration rate of the sterling jewelers divisions inhouse customer finance program additional drivers of the receivables increase were a slightly lower collection rate and higher mix of guests opting for regular credit terms which require lower monthly payments and no down payment as opposed to the interest free programscash used for inventory was 460 million compared to 1216 million in fiscal 2015 the change in inventory cash flows is attributed to the growth in total inventory to 24539 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 24390 million in fiscal 2015 noting key drivers were new store growth and increased diamond inventory associated with managements diamond sourcing initiative offsetting these increases were focused management efforts to improve inventory turns primarily in the zale division and the impact of the us dollar
