diamond sourcing and manufacturing through its wholly owned subsidiary signet direct diamond sourcing limited in fiscal 2013 signet was appointed by rio tinto as a select diamantaire which provides the company with a contracted allocation of rough diamonds provided by rio tinto as well as entered into other supplier agreements in fiscal 2014 signet acquired a diamond polishing factory in gaborone botswana and established a diamond buying office in india these developments in signets longterm diamond sourcing capabilities mean that signet is able to buy rough diamonds directly from the miners and then have the stones marked cut and polished in its own polishing facility signets objective with this initiative is to secure additional reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for our customers while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain  direct sourcing of polished diamonds  the us division purchases loose polished diamonds on the world markets and from signets wholly owned diamond polishing factory in botswana as well as outsources the majority of casting assembly and finishing operations to third parties in addition signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers in combination these account for 40 of signets diamond merchandise by using these approaches the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling the us division to provide better value to the customer which helps to increase market share and achieve higher gross merchandise margins the contract manufacturing strategy also allows signets buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and in turn leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products  sourcing of finished merchandise  merchandise is purchased as a finished product where the item is complex the merchandise is considered likely to have a less predictable sales pattern or where the labor cost can be reduced this method of buying inventory provides the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with the supplier thereby reducing the risk of over or underpurchasing  management believes that the divisions scale and strong balance sheet enables it to purchase merchandise at an advantageous price and on favorable terms  merchandise held on consignment  merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs this minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and obsolescence and provides the flexibility to return nonperforming merchandise all of signets consignment inventory is held in the us at february 1 2014 the us division held 3126 million february 2 2013 2277 million of merchandise on consignment see note 11 of item 8  suppliers  in fiscal 2014 the five largest suppliers collectively accounted for approximately 22 fiscal 2013 23 of the us divisions total purchases

party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in asia    16    table of contents the division benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers and damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results although management believes that alternative sources of supply are available the abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the holiday season could result in a materially adverse effect on performance therefore a regular dialogue is maintained with suppliers particularly in the present economic climate  luxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies to sell their timepieces on a store by store basis in the us signet sells its luxury watch brands primarily through jared where management believes that they help attract customers to jared and build sales in all categories  raw materials and the supply chain  the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a much lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones diamonds account for about 55 and gold about 15 of the us divisions cost of merchandise sold respectively  the ability of signet to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs varies and an inability to increase retail prices could result in lower profitability signet has over time been able to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs due to the visibility of cost increases and the turn of inventory  signet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of options net zerocost collar arrangements forward contracts and commodity purchasing it is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds the cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry with labor costs also being a significant factor management continues to seek ways to reduce the cost of goods sold and enhance the resilience of its supply chain  the largest product category sold by signet is diamonds and diamond jewelry changes in government policy in a number of african diamond producing countries have caused significant changes in the structure of the diamond supply chain in recent years in addition there are changes in the ownership of diamond mines and further major changes are likely  inventory management  sophisticated inventory management systems for merchandise testing assortment planning allocation and replenishment are in place thereby reducing inventory risk by enabling management to identify and respond quickly to changes in customers buying patterns the majority of merchandise is common to all us division mall stores with the remainder allocated to reflect demand in individual stores management believes that the merchandising and inventory management systems as well as improvements in the productivity of the centralized distribution center have allowed the us division to achieve consistent improvement in inventory turns the vast majority of inventory is held at stores rather than in the central distribution facility other sales  while custom design and repair services represent less than 10 of sales they account for approximately 30 of transactions and have been identified by management as an important opportunity to build customer loyalty all jared stores have a highly visible design and service center which is open the same hours as the store the repair centers meet the repair requirements of the store in which they are located and also provide the same service for the us divisions mall brand stores as a result nearly all customer repairs are performed inhouse unlike many other retailers which do this through subcontractors the custom design and repair function has its own field management and training structure    17    table of contents the us division sells as a separate item a lifetime repair service plan for jewelry these plans cover services such as ring sizing refinishing and polishing rhodium plating of white gold earring repair chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise such work is performed inhouse

inventory until the products are ordered by customers which are referred to as virtual inventory virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and instore virtual inventory reduces the divisions investment in inventory while increasing the selection available to the customer  us marketing and advertising  management believes customers confidence in our retail brands store brand name recognition and advertising of branded differentiated and exclusive ranges are important factors in determining buying decisions in the jewelry industry where the majority of merchandise is unbranded therefore the us division continues to strengthen and promote its brands by delivering superior customer service and building brand name recognition the marketing channels used include television digital media desktop mobile and social radio print catalog direct mail telephone marketing point of sale signage and instore displays  while marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year the level of activity is concentrated at periods when customers are expected to be most receptive to marketing messages which is ahead of christmas day valentines day

managing the process inhouse is a strength of signets us division the us division            establishes credit policies that take into account the overall impact on the business in particular the us divisions objective is to facilitate the sale of jewelry and to collect the outstanding credit balance as quickly as possible minimizing risk and enabling the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using the credit facility in contrast management believes that many financial institutions focus on earning interest by maximizing the outstanding credit balance            utilizes

appropriate for the business            provides a database of regular customers and their spending patterns            facilitates investment in systems and management of credit offerings appropriate

delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those amounts 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analyses are required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio  each individual application for credit is evaluated centrally against set lending criteria the risks associated with the granting of credit to particular groups of customers with similar characteristics are balanced against the gross merchandise margin earned by the proposed sales to those customers management believes that the primary drivers of the net bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary customer credit models used when granting customer credit the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances credit sales as a percentage to total us sales and the overall macroeconomic environment cash flows associated with the granting of
