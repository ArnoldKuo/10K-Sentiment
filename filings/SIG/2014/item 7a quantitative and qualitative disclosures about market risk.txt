  signet is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates certain commodity prices and interest rates  signet monitors and manages these market exposures as a fundamental part of its overall risk management program which recognizes the volatility of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects of this volatility on signets operating results  market risk management policy  a committee of the board is responsible for the implementation of market risk management policies within the treasury policies and guidelines framework which are deemed to be appropriate by the board for the management of market risk  signets exposure to market risk is managed by signets treasury committee consisting of signets chief executive officer chief financial officer and treasurer where deemed necessary to achieve the objective of reducing market risk volatility on signets operating results certain derivative instruments are entered into after review and approval by the treasury committee signet uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only  a description of signets accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 1 of item 8 signets current portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and for the purchase of gold forward purchase contracts and net zerocost collar arrangements an analysis quantifying the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by signet to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates is detailed in note 19 of item 8  foreign currency exchange rate risk  approximately 88 of signets total assets were held in entities whose functional currency is the us dollar at february 1 2014 and approximately 84 of its sales and 93 of its operating income in fiscal 2014 were generated in us dollars nearly all the remainder of signets assets sales and operating income are in pounds sterling  in translating the results of its uk operations signets results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar any depreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could increase reported revenues and operating profit and any appreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could decrease reported revenues and operating profit the board has chosen not to hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on signets operating results  the uk division buys certain products and materials on international markets that are priced in us dollars and therefore has an exposure to exchange rates on the cost of goods sold signet uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of this exposure within treasury guidelines approved by the board  signet holds a fluctuating amount of pounds sterling cash reflecting the cash generating characteristics of the uk division signets objective is to minimize net foreign exchange exposure to the income statement on pound sterling denominated items through managing this level of cash pound sterling denominated intercompany balances and us dollar to pound sterling swaps in order to manage the foreign exchange exposure and minimize the level of pound sterling cash held by signet the pound sterling denominated subsidiaries pay dividends regularly to their immediate holding companies and excess pounds sterling are sold in exchange for us dollars    84    table of contents commodity price risk  signets results are subject to fluctuations in the cost of diamonds gold and certain other precious metals which are key raw material components of the products sold by signet  it is signets policy to minimize the impact of precious metal commodity price volatility on operating results through the use of forward purchases of or by entering into either purchase options or net zerocost collar arrangements within treasury guidelines approved by the board  interest rate risk  signets interest income or expense is exposed to volatility in interest rates this exposure is driven by both the currency denomination of the cash or debt the mix of fixed and floating rate debt used the type of cash investments and the total amount of cash and debt outstanding  sensitivity analysis  management has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of signets financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates as shown in the table below  fair value changes arising from                            in millions   fair valuefebruary 12014     1 rise ininterest rates     10depreciation of against      10depreciation ofgoldprices     fair valuefebruary 22013     foreign exchange contracts    19            42            10     commodity contracts                             62      18    floating rate borrowings                                          the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis quantify the impact of market risk assuming that certain adverse market conditions specified in the table above occur they are not forwardlooking estimates of market risk actual results in the future are likely to differ materially from those projected due to changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and actual developments in the global financial markets  any changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and developments in the global financial markets may cause fluctuations in interest rates exchange rates and precious metal prices to exceed the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table above the sensitivity scenarios are intended to allow an expected risk measure to be applied to the scenarios as opposed to the scenarios themselves being an indicator of the maximum expected risk  the fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on market value equivalents at period end taking into account the current interest rate environment current foreign currency forward rates or current commodity forward rates  the estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an increase of 1 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at february 1 2014 with all other variables remaining constant  the estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on a 10 depreciation of the us dollar against pound sterling from the levels applicable at february 1 2014 with all other variables remaining constant    85    table of contents
