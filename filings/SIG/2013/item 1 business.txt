structure  while the us division operates under the kay jared ultra and a number of regional store brands many functions are integrated to gain economies of scale for example store operations have a separate dedicated field management team for the mall store brands jared and the instore repair function while there is a combined diamond sourcing function  us customer experience and human resources  in specialty jewelry retailing the level and quality of customer service is a key competitive advantage because nearly every instore transaction involves the sales associate taking out a piece of jewelry or a watch from a display case and presenting it to the customer therefore the ability to recruit train and retain qualified sales associates is important in determining sales profitability and the rate of net store space growth consequently the us division has in place comprehensive recruitment training and incentive programs and uses employee and customer satisfaction surveys to monitor and improve performance a continual priority of the us division is to improve the quality of the customer experience to enhance customer service the us division is increasingly using salesenhancing technology including customerassisted selling systems these computerized tools enable a sales associate to better assist a potential customer to make a purchase decision investment in the digital environment such as websites mobile applications and social media further adds to the customers shopping choices  us merchandising and purchasing  management believes that merchandise selection availability and value are critical success factors for a specialty retail jeweler in the us business the range of merchandise offered and the high level of inventory availability are supported centrally by extensive and continuous research and testing bestselling products are identified and replenished rapidly through analysis of sales by stock keeping unit this approach enables the us division to deliver a focused assortment of merchandise to maximize sales and inventory turn and minimize the need for discounting management believes that the us division is better able than its competitors to offer greater value and consistency of merchandise due to its supply chain strengths discussed below in addition in recent years management has continued to develop refine and execute a strategy to increase the proportion of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise sold in response to customer demand  the scale and information systems available to management and the gradual evolution of jewelry fashion trends allow for the careful testing of new merchandise in a range of representative stores this enables management to make more informed investment decisions about which merchandise to select thereby increasing the us divisions ability to satisfy customers requirements while reducing the likelihood of having to discount merchandise    12    table of

for the purchase of jewelry and watches in the us division the bridal category which includes engagement wedding and anniversary purchases is estimated by management to account for about 50 of merchandise sales and is predominantly diamond jewelry the bridal category is believed by management to be more stable than the other reasons for buying jewelry but is still dependent on the economic environment as customers can trade up or down price points depending on their available budget outside of the bridal category jewelry and watch purchases including for gift giving have a much broader merchandise mix gift giving is particularly important during the holiday season valentines day and mothers day  a further categorization of merchandise is branded differentiated and exclusive thirdparty branded and core merchandise core merchandise includes items and styles such as solitaire rings and diamond stud earrings which are uniquely designed as well as items that are generally available from other jewelry retailers it also includes styles such as diamond fashion bracelets rings and necklaces within this category the us division has many exclusive designs of particular styles and provides high quality merchandise with great value to customers thirdparty branded merchandise includes mostly watches but also includes ranges such as charm bracelets produced by pandora branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise are items that are branded and exclusive to signet within its marketplaces or that are not widely available in other specialty jewelry retailers  branded differentiated and exclusive ranges  management believes that the development of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise raises the profile of signets stores helps to drive sales and provides its well trained sales associates with a powerful selling proposition such brands may also have a slightly higher gross merchandise margin than unbranded merchandise of a similar product specification and there is significantly less exposure to competitive discounting national television advertisements for kay and jared include elements that drive brand awareness and purchase intent of these ranges management believes that signets scale and proven record of success in developing branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise attracts offers of such programs from jewelry manufacturers designers and others ahead of competing retailers and enables it to better leverage its supply chain strengths management plans to develop additional branded differentiated and exclusive ranges as appropriate and to further expand and refine those already launched  branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise includes            the leo diamond collection which is sold exclusively

by rio tinto as a select diamontaire sightholder as well as entered into other supplier agreements marking a significant development in signets longterm diamond sourcing capabilities this means that signet is able to buy rough diamonds directly and then have the stones marked cut and polished on a contract basis signets objective is to expand this activity and secure additional reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for our customers while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain  direct sourcing of polished diamonds  signet purchases loose polished diamonds on the world markets and outsources the casting assembly and finishing operations to third parties in addition signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers in combination these account for 43 of signets diamond merchandise by using these approaches the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling the us division to provide better value to the customer which helps to increase market share and achieve higher gross merchandise margins the contract manufacturing strategy also allows signets buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and in turn leverage that knowledge with regard to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products  sourcing of finished merchandise  merchandise is purchased as a finished product where the item is complex the merchandise is considered likely to have a less predictable sales pattern or where the labor cost can be reduced this method of buying inventory provides the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with the supplier thereby reducing the risk of over or underpurchasing  management believes that the divisions scale and strong balance sheet enables it to purchase merchandise at a lower price and on better terms than most of its competitors  merchandise held on consignment  merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs this minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and obsolescence and provides the flexibility to return nonperforming    14    table of contents  merchandise at february 2 2013 the us division held 2277 million january 28 2012 1410 million of merchandise on consignment which included 579 million of consignment inventory held by ultra

accounting for approximately 6 fiscal 2012 6 the us division directly transacts business with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in asia  the division benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers and damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results although management believes that alternative sources of supply are available the abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the holiday season could result in a materially adverse effect on performance therefore a regular dialogue is maintained with suppliers particularly in the present economic climate  luxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies to sell their timepieces on a store by store basis in the us signet sells its luxury watch brands primarily through jared where management believes that they help attract customers to jared and build sales in all categories  raw materials and the supply chain  the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a much lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones diamonds account for about 55 and gold about 15 of the us divisions cost of merchandise sold respectively  the ability of signet to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs varies and an inability to increase retail prices could result in lower profitability signet has over time been able to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs due to the visibility of cost increases and the turn of inventory  signet undertakes hedging for a portion of its requirement for gold through the use of options forward contracts and commodity purchasing it is not possible to hedge against fluctuations in the cost of diamonds the cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry with labor costs also being a significant factor management continues to seek ways to reduce the cost of goods sold and enhance the resilience of its supply chain  the largest product category sold by signet is diamonds and diamond jewelry the supply and price of diamonds in the principal world markets are influenced by a single entity the diamond trading company dtc a subsidiary of de beers consolidated mines limited although its market share has been decreasing changes in government policy in a number of african diamond producing countries have caused significant changes in the structure of the diamond supply chain in recent years in addition there are changes in the ownership of diamond mines and further major changes are likely  inventory management  sophisticated inventory management systems for merchandise testing assortment planning allocation and replenishment are in place thereby reducing inventory risk by enabling management to identify and respond quickly to changes in customers buying patterns the majority of merchandise is common to all us division mall stores with the remainder allocated to reflect demand in individual stores management believes that the merchandising and inventory management systems as well as improvements in the productivity of the    15    table of contents  centralized distribution center have allowed the us division to achieve consistent improvement in inventory turns the vast majority of inventory is held at stores rather than in the central distribution facility  other sales  while repair and design services represent less than 10 of sales they account for approximately 30 of transactions and have been identified by management as an important opportunity to build customers loyalty all jared stores have a highly visible jewelry repair center which is open the same hours as the store the repair centers meet the repair requirements of the store in which they are located and also provide the same service for the us divisions mall brand stores as a result nearly all customer repairs are performed inhouse unlike most other chain jewelers which do this through subcontractors the repair and design function has its own field management and training structure  the us division sells as a separate item a lifetime repair service plan for jewelry these plans cover services such as ring sizing refinishing and polishing rhodium plating white gold earring repair chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise such work is performed inhouse  us multichannel capabilities  in fiscal 2013 significant investments and initiatives were completed to drive growth across all of signets selling channels new kay and jared websites with improved functionality in product search and navigation were relaunched in october 2012 increasing product selection by ten times fully transactional enhanced mobile sites for kay and jared were also launched in october 2012 other initiatives in salesenhancing technology included digital tablets in all kay and jared stores signet made significant investments in social media as customer shopping practices require signet to provide leading technology applications kay and jared fan base and followers on facebook and twitter continue to climb and social media outlets are driving more traffic to signets ecommerce sites  virtual inventory  signets supplier relationships allow it to display suppliers inventories on the jared and kay websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers which are referred to as virtual inventory virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and instore virtual inventory reduces the divisions investment in inventory while increasing the selection available to the customer  us marketing and advertising  management believes customers confidence in our retail brands store brand name recognition and advertising of branded differentiated and exclusive ranges are important factors in determining buying decisions in the specialty jewelry sector where the majority of merchandise is unbranded therefore the us division continues to strengthen and promote its brands by delivering superior customer service and building brand name recognition the marketing channels used include television digital media radio print catalog direct mail telephone marketing point of sale signage and instore displays  while marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year the level of activity is concentrated at periods when customers are expected to be most receptive to marketing messages which is ahead of christmas day valentines day and mothers day a significant majority of the expenditure is spent on national television advertising which is used to promote the kay and jared store brands within such advertisements signet also promotes certain merchandise ranges in particular its branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise and other branded products during fiscal 2013 the us division continued to have the leading share of relevant marketing messages share of voice within the us jewelry sector    16

customer loyalty and strengthen the relationship with customers through mail telephone and email communications the program targets current customers with special savings and merchandise offers during key sales periods in addition invitations to special instore promotional events are extended throughout the year  given the size of the marketing budgets for kay and jared management believes this has increased the us divisions competitive marketing advantage the ability to advertise branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise on national television is of growing importance the us divisions

the customer provides a significant advantage to the retailer and that managing the process inhouse is a competitive strength of signets us division the us division            establishes credit policies that take into account the overall impact on the business in particular the us divisions objective is to facilitate the sale of jewelry and to collect the outstanding credit balance as quickly as possible minimizing risk and enabling the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using the credit facility in contrast management believes that many financial institutions focus on earning interest by maximizing the outstanding credit balance            utilizes proprietary authorization and collection models which consider information on the behavior of the divisions customers            allows management to establish and implement service standards appropriate for the business            provides a database of regular customers and their spending patterns            facilitates investment in systems and management of credit offerings appropriate for the business and            maximizes cost effectiveness by utilizing inhouse capability    17    table of contents the various customer finance programs assist in establishing and enhancing customer loyalty and complement the marketing strategy by enabling a greater number of purchases higher units per transaction and greater value sales  in addition to interestbearing transactions that involve the use of inhouse customer finance a portion of credit sales are made using interestfree financing for one year subject to certain conditions in most us states customers are offered optional thirdparty credit insurance  the customer financing operation is centralized and fully integrated into the management of the us division and is not a separate operating division nor does it report separate results all assets and liabilities relating to customer financing are shown on the balance sheet and there are no associated offbalance sheet arrangements signets balance sheet and access to liquidity do not constrain the us divisions ability to grant credit which is a further competitive strength in the current economic environment the us divisions customer finance facility may only be used for purchases from the us division  allowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of goods sold in the income statement the allowance is calculated using factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analyses are required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio  each individual application for credit is evaluated centrally against set lending criteria the risks associated with the granting of credit to particular groups of customers with similar characteristics are balanced against the gross merchandise margin earned by the proposed sales to those customers management believes that the primary drivers of the net bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary customer credit models used when granting customer credit the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances credit sales as a percentage to total us sales and the rate of change in the level of unemployment in the us economy cash flows associated with the granting of credit to customers of the individual store are included in the projections used when
