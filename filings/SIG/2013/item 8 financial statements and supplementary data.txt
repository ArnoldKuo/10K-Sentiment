ended january 29 2011 fiscal 2011 intercompany balances have been eliminated on consolidation  b use of estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of receivables inventory and deferred revenue fair value of derivatives depreciation and asset impairment the valuation of employee benefits income taxes and contingencies  c foreign currency translation  the results of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not us dollars are translated into us dollars at the weighted average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets are translated at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date the average exchange rate is calculated using the weekly exchange rates weighted by the level of sales within the relevant period exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries into us dollars and matched foreign currency borrowings are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income transaction gains and losses are also recognized in arriving at operating income  d revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when            there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement            delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered            the sellers price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and            collectability is reasonably assured    86    table of contents signets revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below  merchandise sales  store sales are recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the store with cash inhouse customer finance or credit card for online sales sales are recognized at the estimated time the customer has received the merchandise amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are reflected in sales and the related costs are reflected in cost of sales  revenue on the sale of merchandise is reported net of anticipated returns and sales tax collected returns are estimated based on previous return rates experienced  any deposits received from a customer for merchandise are deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer receives the merchandise  certain of signets merchandise sales are derived from providing replacement merchandise on behalf of insurance organizations to their customers who have experienced a loss of their property in these cases the sales price is established by contract with the insurance organization and revenue on the sale is recognized upon receipt of the merchandise by the customer  merchandise repairs  revenue on repair of merchandise is recognized when the service is complete and the customer collects the merchandise at the store  extended service plans and lifetime warranty agreements  the us division sells extended service plans where it is obliged subject to certain conditions to perform repair work over the lifetime of the product revenue from the sale of extended service plans is deferred over 14 years revenue is recognized in relation to the costs expected to be incurred in performing these services with approximately 46 of revenue recognized within the first two years the deferral period is determined from patterns of claims costs including estimates of future claims costs expected to be incurred management reviews the trends in claims to assess whether changes are required to the revenue and cost recognition rates used all direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized and disclosed as either other current assets or other assets  the us division provides a product lifetime diamond and color gemstone guarantee as long as sixmonth inspections are performed and certified by an authorized store representative provided the customer has complied with the six month inspection policy signet will replace

and the costs of such claims inclusive of labor and material  signet also sells warranty agreements in the capacity of an agent on behalf of a thirdparty the commission that signet receives from the thirdparty is recognized at the time of the sale less an estimate of cancellations based on historical experience  sale vouchers  in connection with certain promotions the company gives customers making a purchase a voucher granting the customers a discount on a future purchase redeemable within a stated time frame the company accounts for such vouchers by allocating the fair value of the voucher between the initial purchase and the future purchase    87    table of contents  the fair value of the voucher is determined based on the average sales transactions in which the vouchers were issued and the estimated average sales transactions when the vouchers are expected to be redeemed combined with the estimated voucher redemption rate the fair value allocated to the future purchase is recorded as deferred revenue  sale of consignment inventory  sales of consignment inventory are accounted for on a gross sales basis this reflects that the company is the primary obligor providing independent advice guidance and after sales service to customers the products sold from consignment inventory are indistinguishable to the customer from other products that are sold from purchased inventory they are sold on the same terms and are not separately identified as consignment items in the stores the company selects the products and suppliers at its own discretion and is responsible for determining the selling price and the physical security of the products making it liable for any inventory loss it also takes the credit risk of a sale to the customer  e cost of sales and selling

cost less accumulated depreciation amortization and impairment losses maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows           buildings   30 to 40 years when land is owned or the remaining term of lease not to exceed 30 to 40 years   leasehold improvements   remaining term of lease not to exceed 10 years   furniture and fixtures   ranging from 3  10 years   equipment including software   ranging from 3  5 years    88    table of contents equipment which includes computer software purchased or developed for internal use is stated at cost less accumulated amortization signets policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software in addition signet also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer projects amortization is charged on a straightline basis over periods from three to five years  property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable potentially impaired assets or asset groups are identified by reviewing the cash flows of individual stores recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the undiscounted cash flow is less than the assets carrying amount the impairment charge recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value property and equipment at stores planned for closure are depreciated over a revised estimate of their useful lives  i goodwill and other intangibles  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the companys interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired goodwill recorded by the companys two reporting units us and uk based on the acquisitions made by each division goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually as of the last day of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value  the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value if a qualitative assessment is not performed or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value then the reporting units fair value is compared to its carrying value fair value is determined through the income approach using discounted cash flow models or marketbased methodologies significant estimates used in these discounted cash flow models include the weighted average cost of capital longterm growth rates expected changes to selling prices direct costs and profitability of the business and working capital requirements management estimates discount rates using posttax rates that reflect assessments of the time value of money and companyspecific risks if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the company determines the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value the company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference  see note 14 for additional discussion of the goodwill recorded by the company during fiscal 2013 there have been no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the fiscal periods presented in the consolidated income statements if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required the balance is recorded in other assets and was 246 million as of february 2 2013 and 0 as of january 28 2012 see note 12  j inventories  inventories primarily represent goods held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using average cost and includes costs directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition these include relevant warehousing distribution and certain buying security and data processing costs market value is defined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing selling and distribution inventory writedowns are made for obsolete slow moving or defective items and shrinkage the writedown is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates future demand management strategy and market conditions shrinkage is estimated and recorded based on historical physical inventory    89    table of contents  results expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and distribution centers  k vendor contributions  contributions are received from vendors through various programs and arrangements including cooperative advertising where vendor contributions related to identifiable promotional events are received these are matched against the costs of these promotions vendor contributions which are received as general contributions and not related to specific promotional events are recognized as a reduction of inventory costs  l inhouse customer finance programs  signets us division operates customer inhouse finance programs that allow customers to finance merchandise purchases from the us divisions stores signet recognizes finance charges in accordance with the contractual agreements gross interest earned is recorded as other operating income in the income statement see note 3 in addition to interestbearing accounts a significant proportion of credit sales are made using interestfree financing for one year or less subject to certain conditions  accrual of interest is suspended when accounts become more than 90 days aged upon suspension of the accrual of interest interest income is subsequently recognized to the extent cash payments are received accrual of interest is resumed when receivables are removed from nonaccrual status  m accounts receivable  accounts receivable are stated at their nominal amounts and include account balances outstanding from signets inhouse customer finance programs and other accounts receivable the finance receivables from the inhouse customer finance programs are comprised of a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance the initial acceptance of customer finance arrangements is based on proprietary consumer credit scores subsequent to the initial finance purchase signet monitors the credit quality of its customer finance receivable portfolio based on payment activity that drives the aging of receivables this credit quality indicator is assessed on a realtime basis by signet  accounts receivable under the customer finance programs are shown net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts see note 10 this allowance is an estimate of the losses as of the balance sheet date and is calculated using a proprietary model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those amounts 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance the calculation is reviewed by management to assess whether based on economic events additional analyses are required to appropriately estimate losses inherent in the portfolio  allowances for uncollectible amounts are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the income statement receivables are charged off to the allowance when amounts become more than 120 days aged on the recency method and more than 240 days aged on the contractual method see note 10  n leases  assets held under capital leases relate to leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have passed to signet all other leases are defined as operating leases where operating leases include predetermined rent increases those rents are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term including any construction period or other rental holiday other rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred premiums paid to acquire shortterm leasehold properties and inducements to enter into a lease are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term    90    table of contents certain leases provide for contingent rentals that are not measurable at inception these contingent rentals are primarily based on a percentage of sales in excess of a predetermined level these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable  o income taxes  income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  at any point in time various tax years are subject to or are in the process of audit by various taxing authorities to the extent that managements estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made  p employee benefits  signet operates a defined benefit pension plan in the uk the uk plan which ceased to admit new employees from april 2004 during fiscal 2013 and 2012 participating eligible employees were members of the uk plan which provides benefits based on members salaries at retirement the uk plans assets are held by the uk plan trustees and are completely separate from signet  the net periodic cost of the uk plan is measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality the expected longterm rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee attrition gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions if such gains or losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of the employees  the net periodic pension cost is charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement  the funded status of the uk plan is recognized on the balance sheet and is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation measured at the balance sheet date any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost are recognized net of tax in the period within other comprehensive loss income  signet also operates a defined contribution pension plan in the uk and sponsors a defined contribution 401k retirement savings plan in the us contributions made by signet to these pension arrangements are charged to selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement as incurred  q derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting  signet uses derivative financial instruments for risk management or nontrading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure forward foreign currency and commodity purchase contracts are used to manage forecast exposures arising from future purchases    91    table of contents derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value of the derivatives being recognized immediately in the income statement or accumulated other comprehensive loss income depending on the timing and designated purpose of the derivative  changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting together with any hedge ineffectiveness are recognized immediately in other operating income net for the effective portion of cash flow hedges amounts previously recognized in equity are recognized in the income statement in the same period and on the same line in which the hedged item affects net income or loss  r cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand money market deposits and amounts placed with external fund managers with an original maturity of three months or less and are carried at cost which approximates to fair value in addition receivables from thirdparty credit card issuers are considered cash equivalents as they are typically converted to cash within 5 days of the original sales transaction  s borrowing costs  borrowings comprise interest bearing bank loans private placement loan notes and bank overdrafts borrowing costs are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the contractual term of the related loan  t sharebased compensation  signet measures sharebased compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost as an expense on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period of employees certain of signets share plans include a condition whereby vesting is contingent on growth exceeding a given target and therefore awards granted with this condition are considered to be performance related shares  signet measures sharebased compensation cost for awards classified as liabilities at fair value which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until the performance criteria have been satisfied and the amounts are reclassified to equity changes in the fair value that occur while the award is liability classified are recognized as a compensation cost over the requisite service period  signet estimates fair value using a blackscholes model for the omnibus plan awards and the binomial valuation model for the saving share options deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on the income tax returns of subsidiaries are recorded by signet based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the subsidiaries statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a deduction differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the subsidiaries income tax return are recorded in additional paidincapital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the income statement if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paidincapital exists from previous awards  sharebased compensation is primarily recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the income statement along with the relevant salary cost  see note 23 for a further description of signets share option plans    92    table of contents u contingent liabilities  provisions for contingent liabilities are recorded for probable losses when management is able to estimate the loss or range of loss  v common shares  when new shares are issued they are recorded in common shares at their par value the excess of the issue price over the par value is recorded in additional paidin capital  the cost of company shares purchased to satisfy the exercise of employee share options is deducted from total equity and the proceeds of their issuance are credited to total equity  w dividends  dividends are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings in the period in which they are formally approved  x recently issued accounting pronouncements  adopted during the period  presentation of comprehensive income  in june 2011 the financial accounting
