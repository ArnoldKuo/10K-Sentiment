  spending on goods that are or are perceived to be luxuries such as jewelry is discretionary and is affected by general economic conditions therefore a decline in consumer spending whether due to adverse changes in the economy changes in tax policy or other factors that reduce our customers demand for our products may unfavorably impact signets future sales and earnings  jewelry purchases are discretionary and are dependent on consumers perceptions of general economic conditions particularly as jewelry is often perceived to be a luxury purchase adverse changes in the economy and periods when discretionary spending by consumers may be under pressure could unfavorably impact sales and earnings  the success of signets operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending these include economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions by consumers consumer confidence employment the rate of change in employment the level of consumers disposable income and income available for discretionary expenditure the savings ratio business conditions interest rates consumer debt and asset values availability of credit and levels of taxation for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where it operates signets success also depends upon its reputation for integrity in sourcing its merchandise which if adversely affected could impact consumer sentiment and willingness to purchase signets merchandise  as 18 of signets sales are accounted for by its uk division and economic conditions in the eurozone including the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe have a significant impact on the uk economy even though the uk is not a member therefore developments in the eurozone could adversely impact trading in the uk division in addition developments in the eurozone could also adversely impact the us economy  more than half of us sales are made utilizing customer finance provided by signet therefore any deterioration in the consumers financial position could adversely impact sales and earnings  any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increase in consumer debt levels may inhibit consumers use of credit and decrease the consumers ability to satisfy signets requirement for access to customer finance and could in turn have an adverse effect on the us divisions sales furthermore any downturn in general or local economic conditions in particular an increase in unemployment in the markets in which the us division operates may adversely affect its collection of outstanding accounts receivable its net bad debt charge and hence earnings  changes to the regulatory requirements regarding the granting of credit to customers could adversely impact sales and operating income  about half of signets us sales utilize its inhouse customer financing programs and about a further 35 of purchases are made using third party bank cards signets ability to extend credit to customers and the terms on which it is achieved depends on many factors including compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations any of which may change from time to time and such changes in law relating to the provision of credit and associated services could adversely affect sales and income in addition other restrictions arising from applicable law could cause limitations in credit terms currently offered or a reduction in the level of credit granted by the us division or by third parties and this could adversely impact sales income or cash flow as could any reduction in the level of credit granted by the us division or by third parties as a result of the restrictions placed on fees and interest charged  the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law in july 2010 among other things the us doddfrank act creates a bureau of consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking and supervisory authority for a wide range of consumer financial services including signets customer finance programs the bureaus authority became effective in july 2011 any new regulatory initiatives by the bureau    25    table of contents  could impose additional costs andor restrictions on credit practices on the us division which could adversely affect its ability to conduct its business  signets share price may be volatile  signets share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in the actual or anticipated results and financial conditions of signet and of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other shares in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies  the concentration of a significant proportion of sales and an even larger share of profits in the fourth quarter means results are dependent on the performance during that period  signets business is highly seasonal with a significant proportion of its sales and operating profit generated during its fourth quarter which includes the holiday season management expects to continue to experience a seasonal fluctuation in its sales and earnings therefore there is limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in its operations and strategies in other quarters or to recover from any extensive disruption for example due to sudden adverse changes in consumer confidence inclement weather conditions having an impact on a significant number of stores in the last few days immediately before christmas day or disruption to warehousing and store replenishment systems a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any fiscal year would therefore be expected to have a material adverse effect on the annual results of operations disruption at lesser peaks in sales at valentines day and mothers day would impact the results to a lesser extent  signet is dependent on a variety of financing resources to fund its operations and growth which may include equity cash balances and debt financing  while signet has a strong balance sheet with significant cash balances and available lines of credit it is dependent upon the availability of equity cash balances and debt financing to fund its operations and growth if signets access to capital were to become significantly constrained its financing costs would likely increase its financial condition would be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected the changes in general credit market conditions also affect signets ability to arrange and the cost of arranging credit facilities  management prepares annual budgets medium term plans and risk models which help to identify the future capital requirements so that appropriate facilities can be put in place on a timely basis if these models are inaccurate adequate facilities may not be available  signets borrowing agreements include various financial covenants and operating restrictions a material deterioration in its financial performance could result in a covenant being breached if signet were to breach or believed it was going to breach a financial covenant it would have to renegotiate its terms with current lenders or find alternative sources of finance if current lenders required cancellation of facilities or early repayment  in addition signets reputation in the financial markets and its corporate governance practices can influence the availability of capital the cost of capital and its share price  as signet has material cash balances it is exposed to counterparty credit risks  at february 2 2013 signet had cash and cash equivalents of 3010 million january 28 2012 4868 million signet holds its cash and cash equivalents predominantly in aaa rated liquidity funds and in various bank accounts if an institution or fund in which signet invests its cash and cash equivalents were to default or become insolvent signet may be unable to recover these amounts or obtain access to them in a timely manner    26    table of contents movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates impact the results and balance sheet of signet  signet publishes its consolidated annual financial statements in us dollars it held approximately 88 of its total assets in us dollars at february 2 2013 and generated approximately 82 of its sales and 94 of its operating income in us dollars for the fiscal year then ended nearly all the remaining assets sales and operating income are in the uk pounds sterling therefore its results and balance sheet are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar accordingly any decrease in the weighted average value of the pound sterling against the us dollar would decrease reported sales and operating income  the average exchange rate is used to prepare the income statement and is calculated from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division due to seasonality signets results are particularly impacted by movements in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  where pounds sterling are held or used to fund the cash flow requirements of the business any decrease in the weighted average value of the pound sterling against the us dollar would reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and increase the amount of any pounds sterling borrowings  in addition the prices of materials and certain products bought on the international markets by the uk division are denominated in us dollars and therefore the uk division has an exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on the cost of goods sold  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities particularly polished diamonds and gold which account for the majority of signets merchandise costs could adversely impact its earnings and cash availability  the jewelry industry generally is affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds gold and to a lesser extent other precious and semiprecious metals and stones in particular diamonds account for about 45 of signets merchandise costs and gold about 16 in fiscal 2013  in fiscal 2013 polished diamond prices were less variable as compared to fiscal 2012 when the cost of diamonds increased markedly in the first half of the year reaching record levels diamond costs decreased in the second half of fiscal 2012 but remained significantly above those of fiscal 2009 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and during fiscal 2011 the price of polished diamonds purchased by signet increased but remained below fiscal 2009 levels due to the sharp global decline in demand for diamonds in the second half of fiscal 2009 and in the first six months of fiscal 2010 particularly in the us which accounts for about 40 of worldwide demand the supply chain was overstocked with polished diamonds combined with the reduced levels of credit availability the oversupply of diamonds resulted in decreases in the price of loose polished diamonds of all sizes and qualities this was particularly marked in diamonds larger and of better quality than the type that signet typically purchases  industry forecast indicates that over the medium and longer term the demand for diamonds will probably increase faster than the growth in supply particularly as a result of growing demand in countries such as china and india therefore the cost of diamonds is anticipated to rise over time although fluctuations in price are likely to continue to occur the mining production and inventory policies followed by major producers of rough diamonds can have a significant impact on diamond prices as can the inventory and buying patterns of jewelry retailers and other parties in the supply chain a major source of rough diamonds is being developed in    27    table of contents  zimbabwe and the impact of this including the availability and price of diamonds is unknown both the european union and us have sanctions that impact trading of diamonds mined in zimbabwe  while jewelry manufacturing is the major final demand for gold management believes that the cost of gold is predominantly driven by investment transactions which have resulted in a significant increase in its cost over the past seven years although the price of gold has relatively stabilized over the past three years and particularly in the last year signets cost of merchandise and potentially its earnings may be adversely impacted by investment market considerations that cause the price of gold to significantly escalate again  diamonds are the largest product category sold by signet the supply and price of diamonds in the principal world markets are influenced by a single entitythe diamond trading company dtc a subsidiary of de beers consolidated mines limited de beers the dtcs share of the diamond supply chain has decreased over recent years which may result in more volatility in rough diamond prices in 2012 anglo american plc anglo american increased its ownership from 45 to 85 in de beers it is uncertain what if any impact of this transaction may have on de beers  the availability of diamonds is significantly influenced by the political situation in diamond producing countries and by the kimberley process an intergovernmental agreement for the international trading of rough diamonds until acceptable alternative sources of diamonds can be developed any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from significant producing countries or to the trading in rough and polished diamonds which could occur as a result of disruption to the kimberley process could adversely affect signet as well as the retail jewelry market as a whole in 2012 the kimberley process chaired by the united states initiated a process to review ways to strengthen and reform the kimberley process including reviewing the definition of a conflict diamond in january 2013 south africa became the chair and the review process is expected to continue however the current kimberley process decision making procedure is dependent on reaching a consensus among member governments which can result in the protracted resolution of issues and there is little expectation of significant reform the impact of this review process on the supply of diamonds and consumers perception of the diamond supply chain is unknown in addition to the kimberley process the supply of diamonds to the us and the uk is also impacted by certain governmental trade sanctions imposed on zimbabwe  the possibility of constraints in the supply of diamonds of a size and quality signet requires to meet its merchandising requirements may result in changes in signets supply chain practices for example its rough sourcing initiative in addition signet may from time to time choose to hold more inventory to purchase raw materials at an earlier stage in the supply chain or enter into commercial agreements of a nature that it currently does not use such actions could require the investment of cash andor additional management skills such actions may not result in the expected returns and other projected benefits anticipated by management  an inability to increase retail prices to reflect higher commodity costs would result in lower profitability historically jewelry retailers have been able over time to increase prices to reflect changes in commodity costs however in general particularly sharp increases in commodity costs may result in a time lag before increased commodity costs are fully reflected in retail prices as signet uses an average cost inventory methodology volatility in its commodity costs may also result in a time lag before cost increases are reflected in retail prices there is no certainty that such price increases will be sustainable so downward pressure on gross margins and earnings may occur in addition any sustained increases in the cost of commodities could result in the need to fund a higher level of inventory or changes in the merchandise available to the customer  in august 2012 the sec pursuant to the doddfrank act issued final rules which require annual disclosure and reporting on the source and use of certain minerals including gold from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the gold supply chain is complex and while management believes that the rules will only cover less than 1 of annual worldwide gold production based upon current estimates the final rules require signet and other jewelry retailers and manufacturers that file with the sec to exercise reasonable due diligence in determining the country of origin of the statutorily designated minerals that are used in products sold by signet    28    table of contents  in the us and elsewhere signet must first report to the sec on our country of origin inquiries our due diligence measures the results of those activities and our related determinations in may 2014 compliance with the rules will likely add to signets costs but management does not expect this increase to be material there may be reputational risks with customers and other stakeholders if signet due to the complexity of the global supply chain is unable to sufficiently verify the origin for the relevant metals also if the responses of parts of signets supply chain to the verification requests are adverse it may harm signets ability to obtain merchandise and add to compliance costs the final rules also cover tungsten which is contained in a small proportion of items that are sold by signet other minerals such as diamonds could be added to those currently covered by these rules  price increases may have an adverse impact on signets performance  if significant price increases are implemented by either division across a wide range of merchandise the impact on earnings will depend on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customer to higher prices such price increases may result in lower achieved gross margin dollars and adversely impact earnings  while signets major competitors are other specialty jewelers signet also faces competition from other retailers including department stores discount stores apparel outlets and internet sellers of jewelry in addition other retail categories for example electronics and other forms of expenditure such as travel also compete for consumers discretionary expenditure this is particularly so during the christmas gift giving season therefore the price of jewelry relative to other products influences the proportion of consumers expenditure that is spent on jewelry if the relative price of jewelry increases signets sales and earnings may decline  the failure to satisfy the accounting requirements for hedge accounting or default or insolvency of a counterparty to a hedging contract could adversely impact results  signet hedges a portion of its purchases of gold for both its us and uk divisions and us dollar requirements of its uk division the failure to satisfy the requirements of the appropriate accounting requirements or a default or insolvency of a counterparty to a contract could increase the volatility of results and may impact the timing of recognition of gains and losses in the income statement  the inability of signet to obtain merchandise that customers wish to purchase particularly ahead of and during the fourth quarter would adversely impact sales  the abrupt loss or disruption of any significant supplier during the three month period august to october leading up to the fourth quarter would result in a material adverse effect on signets business  also if management misjudges expected customer demand or fails to identify changes in customer demand andor its supply chain does not respond in a timely manner it could adversely impact signets results by causing either a shortage of merchandise or an accumulation of excess inventory  signet benefits from close commercial relationships with a number of suppliers damage to or loss of any of these relationships could have a detrimental effect on results management holds regular reviews with major suppliers signets most significant supplier accounts for 6 of merchandise government requirements regarding sources of commodities such as those required by the doddfrank act could result in signet choosing to terminate relationships with a limited number of suppliers  luxury and prestige watch manufacturers and distributors normally grant agencies to sell their ranges on a store by store basis and most of the leading brands have been steadily reducing the number of agencies in the us and the uk over recent years the watch brands sold by ernest jones and to a lesser extent jared help attract customers and build sales in all categories therefore an inability to obtain or retain watch agencies for a location could harm the performance of that particular store in the case of ernest jones the inability to gain additional    29    table of contents  prestige watch agencies is an important factor in and does reduce the likelihood of opening new stores which could adversely impact sales growth  the growth in importance of branded merchandise within the jewelry market may adversely impact signets sales and earnings if it is unable to obtain supplies of branded merchandise that the customer wishes to purchase in addition if signet loses the distribution rights to an important branded jewelry range it could adversely impact sales and earnings  signet has had success in recent years in the development of branded merchandise that is exclusive to its stores if signet is not able to further develop such branded merchandise or is unable to successfully develop further such initiatives it may adversely impact sales and earnings  an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earnings  in specialty jewelry retailing the level and quality of customer service is a key competitive factor as nearly every instore transaction involves the sales associate taking a piece of jewelry or a watch out of a display case and presenting it to the potential customer competition for suitable individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs therefore an inability to recruit train motivate and retain suitably qualified sales associates could adversely impact sales and earnings  loss of confidence by consumers in signets brand names poor execution of marketing programs and reduced marketing expenditure could have a detrimental impact on sales  primary factors in determining customer buying decisions in the jewelry sector include customer confidence in the retailer and in the brands it sells together with the level and quality of customer service the ability to differentiate signets stores and merchandise from competitors by its branding marketing and advertising programs is an important factor in attracting consumers if these programs are poorly executed or the level of support for them is reduced or the customer loses confidence in any of signets brands for whatever reason it could unfavorably impact sales and earnings  in the past the dtc has promoted unbranded diamonds and diamond jewelry in the us the level of support provided by the dtc and the success of the promotions influenced the size of the total jewelry market in the us as the dtcs market share of rough diamond sales has decreased it has refocused its worldwide marketing efforts on its own brand and substantially decreased the dtcs marketing support for unbranded diamonds and diamond jewelry in the us the impact of these actions is unknown and could unfavorably impact the overall market for diamonds and diamond jewelry and adversely impact signets sales and earnings  longterm changes in consumer attitudes to jewelry could be unfavorable and harm jewelry sales  consumer attitudes to diamonds gold and other precious metals and gemstones also influence the level of signets sales attitudes could be affected by a variety of issues including concern over the source of raw materials the impact of mining and refining of minerals on the environment the local community and the political stability of the producing country labor conditions in the supply chain and the availability and consumer attitudes to substitute products such as cubic zirconia moissanite and of laboratory created diamonds a negative change in consumer attitudes to jewelry could adversely impact sales and earnings  the retail jewelry industry is highly fragmented and competitive aggressive discounting or going out of business sales by competitors may adversely impact signets performance in the short term  the retail jewelry industry is competitive if signets competitive position deteriorates operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected    30    table of contents aggressive discounting by competitors particularly those holding going out of business sales may adversely impact signets performance in the short term this is particularly the case for easily comparable pieces of jewelry of similar quality sold through stores that are situated near to those that signet operates  as a result of the growth of jared and the development of kay outside of its enclosed mall base the us division is increasingly competing with independent specialty jewelry retailers that are able to adjust their competitive stance for example on pricing to local market conditions this can put individual signet stores at a competitive disadvantage as the us division has a national pricing strategy  the inability to rent stores that satisfy managements operational and financial criteria could harm sales as could changes in locations where customers shop  signets results are dependent on a number of factors relating to its stores these include the availability of desirable property the demographic characteristics of the area around the store the design and maintenance of the stores the availability of attractive locations within the shopping center that also meet the operational and financial criteria of management the terms of leases and signets relationship with major landlords the us division leases 18 of its store locations from simon property group signet has no other relationship with any lessor relating to 10 or more of its store locations if signet is unable to rent stores that satisfy its operational and financial criteria or if there is a disruption in its relationship with its major landlords sales could be adversely affected  given the length of property leases that signet enters into it is dependent upon the continued popularity of particular retail locations as signet tests and develops new types of store locations and designs there is no certainty as to their success the majority of longterm space growth opportunities in the us are in new developments and therefore future store space is largely dependent on the investment by real estate developers on new projects currently there is limited new real estate development taking place making it challenging to identify and secure suitable new store locations the uk division has a more diverse range of store locations than in the us including some exposure to smaller retail centers which do not justify the investment required to refurbish the site to the current store format consequently the uk division is gradually closing stores in such locations as leases expire or satisfactory property transactions can be executed however the ability to secure such property transactions is not certain as the uk division is already represented in nearly all major retail centers a small annual decrease in store space is expected in the medium term which will adversely impact sales growth  the rate of new store development is dependent on a number of factors including obtaining suitable real estate the capital resources of signet the availability of appropriate staff and management and the level of the financial return on investment required by management  signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders whose behavior may be affected by its management of social ethical and environmental risks  social ethical and environmental matters influence signets reputation demand for merchandise by consumers the ability to recruit staff relations with suppliers and standing in the financial markets signets success is dependent on the strength and effectiveness of its relationships with its various stakeholders customers shareholders employees and suppliers in recent years stakeholder expectations have increased and signets success and reputation will depend on its ability to meet these higher expectations  inadequacies in and disruption to internal controls and systems could result in lower sales and increased costs or adversely impact the reporting and control procedures  signet is dependent on the suitability reliability and durability of its systems and procedures including its accounting information technology data protection warehousing and distribution systems if support ceased for a critical externally supplied software package or system management would have to implement an alternative    31    table of contents  software package or system or begin supporting the software internally disruption to parts of the business could result in lower sales and increased costs  security breaches and other disruptions to signets information technology infrastructure and databases could interfere with signets operations and could compromise signets and its customers and suppliers information exposing signet to liability which would cause signets business and reputation to suffer  signet operates in multiple channels and in the us division maintains its own customer finance operation signet is also increasingly using mobile devices social networks and other online activities to connect with customers staff and other stakeholders therefore in the ordinary course of business signet relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain merchandise distribution customer invoicing and collection of payments signet uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally signet collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of signets customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to signets business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans signets information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise signets networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage signets reputation which could adversely affect signets business in addition it could harm signets ability to execute its business and adversely impact sales costs and earnings  an adverse decision in legal proceedings andor tax matters could reduce earnings  in march 2008 private plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit for an unspecified amount against sterling jewelers inc sterling a subsidiary of signet in us district court for the southern district of new york which has been referred to private arbitration in september 2008 the us equal employment opportunities commission filed a lawsuit against sterling in us district court for the western district of new york sterling denies the allegations from both parties and has been defending these cases vigorously if however it is unsuccessful in either defense sterling could be required to pay substantial damages at this point no outcome or amount of loss is able to be estimated see note 22 in item 8  at any point in time various tax years are subject to or are in the process of audit by various taxing authorities to the extent that managements estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact income tax in the period in which such determinations are made  failure to comply with labor regulations could harm the business  failure by signet to comply with labor regulations could result in fines and legal actions in addition the ability to recruit and retain staff could be harmed    32    table of contents failure to comply with changes in law and regulations could adversely affect the business  signets policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations changing legal and regulatory requirements have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment in which the business operates and the cost of compliance failure to comply with the various regulatory requirements may result in damage to signets reputation civil and criminal liability fines and penalties and further increase the cost of regulatory compliance changes in tax legislation for example the elimination of lifo for us tax accounting purposes could adversely impact cash flow  investors may face difficulties in enforcing proceedings against signet jewelers limited as it is domiciled in bermuda  it is doubtful whether courts in bermuda would enforce judgments obtained by investors in other jurisdictions including the us and the uk against the parent company or its directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in bermuda against the parent company or its directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions  any difficulty executing an acquisition a business combination or a major business initiative may result in expected returns and other projected benefits from such an exercise not being realized  any difficulty in executing an acquisition a business combination or a major business initiative including its direct diamond sourcing capabilities may result in expected returns and other projected benefits from such an exercise not being realized the acquisition of companies with operating margins lower than that of signet may cause an overall lower operating margin for signet a significant transaction could also disrupt the operation of its current activities signets current borrowing agreements place certain limited constraints on its ability to make an acquisition or enter into a business combination and future borrowing agreements could place tighter constraints on such actions  changes in assumptions used in making accounting estimates or in accounting standards may adversely impact investor perception of the business  changes in assumptions used in making accounting estimates relating to items such as extended service plans and pensions may adversely affect signets financial results and balance sheet changes in accounting standards such as those currently being considered relating to leases could materially impact the presentation of signets results and balance sheet investors reaction to any such change in presentation is unknown such changes could also impact the way that the business is managed and access to the credit markets  loss of one or more key executive officers or employees could adversely impact performance as could the appointment of an inappropriate successor or successors  signets future success will partly depend upon the ability of senior management and other key employees to implement an appropriate business strategy while signet has entered into employment contracts with such key personnel the retention of their services cannot be guaranteed and the loss of such services or the inability to attract and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on signets ability to conduct its business in addition any new executives may wish subject to board approval to change the strategy of signet the appointment of new executives may therefore adversely impact performance
