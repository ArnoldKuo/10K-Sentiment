such nongaap measures in isolation from or in substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap  exchange translation impact  the average exchange rate is used to prepare the income statement and is calculated from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division this means that results are particularly impacted by movements in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year with the exchange rate in the first four weeks of december having the largest effect on the average exchange rate used a movement in the year to date exchange rate from that in the prior quarter in a particular fiscal year will result in that quarters results being impacted by adjustments to sales and costs in prior quarters to reflect the changed year to date exchange rate this can have a particularly noticeable impact on signets results for the third quarter as the results for the third quarter are close to breakeven in addition as the uk divisions selling administrative and general expenses are spread more evenly between quarters than its sales these expenses can be particularly impacted in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2014 it is anticipated a one cent movement in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would impact income before income tax by approximately 03 million    49    table of contents fiscal 2013 overview  similar to many other retailers signet follows the retail 454 reporting calendar which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the 53rd week the 53rd week added 564 million in net sales and decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately 002 for both the quarter and fiscal 2013 the 53rd week is not included in samestore sales calculations  the fiscal 2013 results were led by a same store sales increase of 33 compared to an increase of 90 in fiscal 2012 total sales were up by 62 to 39834 million compared to 37492 million in fiscal 2012 and operating margin improved by 60 basis points to 141 compared to 135 in fiscal 2012 operating income and diluted earnings per share increased to 5605 million compared to 5074 million in fiscal 2012 and 435 per share compared to 373 in fiscal 2012 up by 105 and 166 respectively  at february 2 2013 and january 28 2012 signet had no longterm debt and cash and cash equivalents of 3010 and 4868 million respectively signet repurchased 64 million shares at an average cost of 4470 per share which represented 74 of the shares outstanding at the start of fiscal 2013 as compared to 03 million shares at an average cost of 4957 in fiscal 2012  drivers of operating profitability  the key drivers of operating profitability are            sales performance            gross margin            level of selling general and administrative expenses            balance between the change in same store sales and sales from new store space and            movements in the us dollar to pound sterling exchange rate as 18 of signets sales and approximately 6 of operating income including unallocated costs were generated in the uk in fiscal 2013 and signet reports its results in us dollars  these and other drivers are discussed more fully below  sales  sales performance in both the us and uk divisions is driven by the change in same store sales and net store space same store sales growth is calculated by comparison of sales in stores that were open in both the current and the prior fiscal year sales from stores that have been open for less than 12 months including acquisitions are excluded from the comparison until their 12month anniversary sales from the 12month anniversary onwards are compared against the equivalent prior period sales within the comparable store sales comparison stores closed in the current financial period are included up to the date of closure and the comparative period is correspondingly adjusted stores that have been relocated or expanded but remain within the same local geographic market are included within the comparison with no adjustment to either the current or comparative period stores that have been refurbished are also included within the comparison except for the period when the refurbishment was taking place when those stores are excluded from the comparison both for the current year and for the comparative period sales to employees are also excluded comparisons at divisional level are made in local currency and consolidated comparisons are made at constant exchange rates and exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the weighted average exchange rate for the current period ecommerce sales are included in the calculation of sales for the period and the comparative figures from the anniversary of the launch of the relevant website same store sales exclude the 53rd week in the fiscal year in which it occurs management considers same store sales useful as it is a major benchmark used by investors to judge performance within the retail industry    50    table of contents a new us store typically has sales ranging from 70 to 75 of a five year old store and will only contribute to sales for part of the fiscal year in which it is opened store openings are usually planned to occur in the third quarter and store closures in january although this does not always occur when investing in new space management has stringent operating and financial criteria us net space increased 11 in fiscal 2013 of which 7 related to the ultra acquisition and increased by 1 in fiscal 2012 in the uk there has typically been a decline in space as the division has exited from retail markets where operation no longer meets the economic criteria established by management due to growth in regional malls the uk

sales includes merchandise costs net of discounts and allowances freight processing and distribution costs of moving merchandise from suppliers to the distribution center and to stores inventory shrinkage store operating and occupancy costs net bad debt expense and charges for late payments under the us customer finance program store operating and occupancy costs include utilities rent real estate taxes common area maintenance charges and depreciation as the classification of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have inhouse customer finance programs signets gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers  the gross merchandise margin is the difference between the selling price achieved and the cost of merchandise sold expressed as a percentage of the sales price gross merchandise margin dollars is the difference expressed in monetary terms the trend in gross merchandise margin depends on signets pricing policy movements in the cost of merchandise sold changes in sales mix and the direct cost of providing services such as repairs  important factors that impact gross margin are the cost of diamonds and gold and our ability to adjust prices to offset such costs in the us division about 55 of the cost of merchandise sold is accounted for by polished diamonds and about 15 is accounted for by gold in the uk division diamonds and gold account for about 10 and about 15 respectively of the cost of merchandise sold and watches for about 45 the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate also has a material impact as a significant proportion of the merchandise sold in the uk is purchased in us dollars signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate but is not able to do so for diamonds for gold and currencies the hedging period can extend to 24 months although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of 12 months    51    table of contents the price of diamonds varies depending on their size cut color and clarity during fiscal 2011 polished diamond prices increased from prior levels fluctuated during fiscal 2012 and were less variable during fiscal 2013 demand for diamonds is primarily driven by the manufacture and sale of diamond jewelry and their future price is uncertain  the cost of gold while volatile had steadily increased during fiscal years 2009 through 2012 primarily reflecting increased investment demand rather than changes in the usage for jewelry manufacture during fiscal 2013 although the cost of gold remained volatile the overall cost of gold was little changed from fiscal 2012 with an average cost of 1671 per troy ounce in january 2013 compared to an average cost of 1657 per troy ounce in january 2012 the future price of gold is uncertain  signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and as jewelry inventory turns slowly the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes time to be fully reflected in the gross margin as inventory turn is faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters changes in the cost of merchandise are more quickly reflected in the gross margin in that quarter furthermore signets hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin an increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross margin  account receivables comprise a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance the net us bad debt expense includes an estimate of the allowance for losses as of the balance sheet date the allowance is calculated using a proprietary model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates a 100 allowance is made for any amount that is more than 90 days aged on a recency basis and any amount associated with an account the owner of which has filed for bankruptcy as well as an allowance for those 90 days aged and under based on historical loss information and payment performance management believes that the primary drivers of the net us bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary consumer credit scores used when granting customer finance the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances us credit sales as a percentage of total us sales and the rate of change in the level of unemployment in the us economy  selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and administrative expenses include store staff and store administrative costs centralized administrative expenses including information technology credit and ecommerce advertising and promotional costs and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statements  the primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees employed and the level of compensation taxes and other benefits paid management varies on a store by store basis the hours worked based on the expected level of selling activity subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store nonstore staffing levels are less variable a significant element of compensation is performance based and is primarily dependent on sales or operating profit  the level of advertising expenditure can vary the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by managements judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media  other operating income  other operating income is predominantly interest income arising from inhouse customer finance provided to signets customers by the us division its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged the credit program selected by the customer and the level of outstanding balances the level of outstanding balances is dependent on the sales of the us division the proportion of sales that use the inhouse customer finance and the monthly collection rate    52    table of contents operating income  to maintain operating income signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin any increase in operating costs the impact of any immature selling space and any adverse changes in other operating income same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income when foreseen such as through the us divisions cost saving measures implemented in fiscal 2010 signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions the acquisition of companies with operating margins lower than that of signet may cause an overall lower operating margin for signet  the impact on operating income of a sharp unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance can be significant this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business in the medium term there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level but the time it takes varies depending on the type of cost an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter it is even more difficult to reduce base lease costs in the short or medium term as leases in us malls are typically for ten years jared sites for 20 years and in the uk for five plus years  operating income may also be impacted by significant unusual and nonrecurring items for example in fiscal 2011 the impact of amendments to the truth in lending act had an estimated net direct adverse impact on operating income of 119 million primarily by reducing other operating income in fiscal 2010 the vacation entitlement policy in the us division was changed which resulted in the selling general and administrative costs being reduced while operating income increased by 134 million other line items may also be impacted by significant unusual and nonrecurring items for example in fiscal 2011 signet made a make whole payment of 475 million reflected as an increase to interest expense as a result of the prepayment in full of private placement notes in november 2010  results of operations                        fiscal2013     fiscal2012     fiscal2011    in millions

overview  managements objective is to maintain a strong balance sheet as it regards financial flexibility as a competitive strength  operating activities provide the primary source of cash and are influenced by a number of factors such as            net income which is primarily influenced by sales and operating income margins            changes in the level of inventory            proportion of us sales made using inhouse customer financing programs and the average monthly collection rate of the credit balances            seasonal pattern of sales and            working capital movements associated with changes in store space  other sources of cash would be borrowings or the issuance of common shares for cash    66    table of contents net cash provided by operating activities  as a retail business signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card in the us division if the customer makes use of financing provided by signet the cash is received over a period of time in fiscal 2013 569 of the us divisions sales were made using customer financing provided by signet as compared to 561 in fiscal 2012 the average monthly collection rate from the us customer inhouse finance receivables was 124 as compared to 127 in fiscal 2012  signet typically pays for merchandise about 30 days after receipt due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately 12 months before it is sold in addition signet holds consignment inventory nearly all of which is in the us which at february 2 2013 amounted to 2277 million as compared to 1410 million at january 28 2012 with the increase largely due to 579 million of consignment inventory held by ultra the principal terms of the consignment agreements which can generally be terminated by either party are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties when signet sells consignment inventory it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies item 8  signets largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits these are typically paid on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis with annual bonus payments also being made operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the us division and on a quarterly basis by the uk division payment for advertising on television radio or in newspapers is usually made between 30 and 60 days after the advertisement appears other expenses none of which are material have various payment terms  signets working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales and movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to late november the peak level of working capital is typically 100 million to 150 million above the typical january to august level and can be accentuated by new store openings the working capital position then reverses over the holiday season  the change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales changes in the sourcing practices commodity costs and merchandise mix of the business can also result in changes in inventory the value of inventory in the uk division is also impacted by movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate the change in us customer inhouse finance receivables proportionately reflect changes in sales if credit participation levels remain the same and receivable collection rates were unaltered changes in credit participation and the collection rate also impact the level of receivables movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of us sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales therefore if sales increase working capital would be expected to increase similarly a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capital  investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital as well as fixed capital investment due to the inventory turn and the additional investment required to fund sales in the us utilizing inhouse customer finance of the total investment required to open a new store in the us between 50 and 60 is typically accounted for by working capital new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact in addition the integration and conversion of ultra stores to kay jewelers outlets will require investments in working and fixed capital    67    table of contents in fiscal

the inventory turn accounts payable decreased by 396 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to an increase of 572 million in fiscal 2012 related to accelerated strategic inventory purchases that occurred in fiscal 2012 other movements in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2013 primarily reflect increased income taxes payable reflecting signets performance  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013

rate of space expansion in the us            investment in existing stores reflecting the level of investment in salesenhancing technology and the number of store refurbishments and relocations carried out            investment in divisional head offices and systems which include the us and uk distribution facilities and            purchases of intangible assets primarily of information technology software  when evaluating new store investment management uses an investment hurdle rate of a 20 internal rate of return on a pretax basis over a five year period assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years capital expenditure accounts for about 45 of the investment in a new store in the us division the balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing signet typically carries out a major refurbishment of its stores every ten years but does have some discretion as to the timing of such expenditure a major store refurbishment is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store minor store redecorations are typically carried out every five years in addition to major store refurbishments signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full refurbishment this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal where possible the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities    68    table of contents in fiscal 2013 net cash used in investing activities was

future purchase redeemable within a stated time frame signet accounts for such vouchers by allocating the fair value of the voucher between the initial purchase and the future purchase  the fair value of the voucher is determined based on the average sales transactions in which the vouchers were issued and the estimated average sales transactions when the vouchers are expected to be redeemed

benefits  the expected liabilities of signets defined benefit pension plan the uk plan are calculated based primarily on assumptions regarding salary and pension increases inflation rates discount rates projected life expectancy and the longterm rate of return expected on the uk plans assets a full actuarial valuation was completed as of april 5 2012 and the uk plan valuation is updated at each year end the discount rate assumption of 45 applied for fiscal 2013 is based on the yield at the balance sheet date of long term aa rated corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the uk plans liabilities a 01 increase in this discount rate would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost of 32 million in fiscal 2013 by 03 million the value of the assets of the uk plan is measured as of the balance sheet date which is particularly dependent on the value of equity investments held at that date the overall impact on the consolidated balance sheet is significantly mitigated as the members of the uk plan are only in the uk and account for about 7 of uk employees the uk plan ceased to admit new employees as of april 2004 in addition if net accumulated actuarial gains and losses exceed 10 of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities signet amortizes those gains or losses that exceed this 10 over the average remaining service period of the employees the funded status of
