building on our european presence to further extend the geographical reach of our clearing services we offer clearing services on overthecounter commodity derivative products including energy agriculture freight and precious metals through cme clearing europe and we continue to expand the range of eligible products next steps include the clearing of interest rate swaps in september 2012 we applied to the fsa for approval to create a londonbased exchange that will initially offer trading of foreign exchange futures products and ultimately expand into other products we believe establishing an exchange in the united kingdom will leverage the central counterparty model of cme clearing europe and will allow us to more closely align with our regional customers in both listed

strengthened the capabilities of our overthecounter product offering with the launch of portfolio margining of interest rate swaps and futures positions for all market participants we continue to collaborate with buy and sellside customers to provide the innovative products and services they need to manage their risk effectively in a continuously evolving marketplace in 2012 we cleared

information products and index services and enhancing our intellectual property portfolio  we offer a variety of market data services for the futures equities and the overthecounter markets in june 2012 we established a new joint venture in which mcgrawhill contributed its sampp indices business and we contributed a portion of our cme group index services business to create samppdji a global leader in index services this new venture creates a leading index provider wellpositioned to serve global institutional and retail customers and will allow us to continue to be innovative with product development and cobranding across asset classes as part of the agreement we acquired a longterm ownershiplinked exclusive license to list futures and options on futures based on the sampp indices our

exclusive arrangements with standard amp poors sampp the nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq and dow jones and nonexclusive arrangements with the other third parties in connection with our joint venture with mcgrawhill we entered into a new license agreement with sampp sampp license agreement which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sampp license agreement the joint venture granted cme a license to use certain sampp stock indexes and the related trade names trademarks and service marks in connection

current renewal term  provided that if any open interest arises during such sixmonth period the agreement shall automatically renew our nasdaq license is exclusive through 2019 copies of our sampp dow jones and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements following the wellpublicized issues relating to the credibility of the london interbank offered rate libor numerous investigations were undertaken by regulators and an official study of the benchmark was commissioned to evaluate potential reforms we currently have a licensing and membership agreement with bba enterprises limited and the british bankers association collectively bba for the use of libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract for the license we paid an upfront fee and pay an annual fee based on the ongoing review of libor we expect libor to be reformed rather than replaced and to continue as a regulated benchmark depending upon the outcome of the reform efforts we may need to enter into a new license agreement with bba or the organization appointed to administer the benchmark we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sampp dow jones and nasdaq or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sampp dow jones or nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 9table of contentsseasonality generally we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality may also be impacted by general market conditions or other events during 2012 27 of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 27 in the second quarter 23 in the third quarter and 23 in the fourth quarter working capital we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial conditionliquidity and capital resources beginning on page 50 which section is incorporated herein by reference customer base our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments our customers can access our cme globex trading platform across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges or a permit holder at kcbt rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member or permit holder of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access trading rights and privileges are exchange specific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members and permit holders membership on one of our futures exchanges or ownership of a kcbt permit also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our memberspermit holders have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membershippermit holder benefit protections in 2012 79 of our contract volume was conducted by our members and permit holders the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers two firms each represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2012 in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange in 2011 one of our largest clearing firms was placed into bankruptcy and we transferred all of their more than 30000 customer accounts to other futures commission merchants competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank gives the cftc authority to require certain swaps to be cleared by central clearing houses and to require certain of those swaps mandated for clearing to be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges and less regulated trading platforms have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and productswe encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others competition in our derivatives business we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others depth and liquidity of markets transaction costs breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs transparency reliability and anonymity in transaction processing connectivity accessibility and distribution 10table of contentstechnological capability and innovation efficient and secure settlement clearing and support services regulatory environment and reputation we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and adopt additional customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers our principal competitors include other exchanges such as nyse euronext nyse intercontinentalexchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited hkex and eurex group in addition recent industry developments and alliances such as the electronic liquidity exchange elx have resulted in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment for example in december 2012 nyse and ice entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which ice would acquire nyse hkex completed its acquisition of the london metal exchange in 2012we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange lookalike contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts as well as from spot markets exchangetraded funds contracts for difference and other substitutes for our products development of swap execution facilities and the mandated clearing requirement for certain products may create platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our privately negotiated and exchangetraded products we primarily face competition from the lchclearnet group in interest rate swaps and ice in credit default swaps competition in our transaction processing business in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the implementation of doddfrank which requires the mandatory central clearing of standardized overthecounter products ice has its own clearing operations which are comprised of regulated clearing houses across the united states europe and canada the options clearing corporation clears uslisted options and clears futures on a number of underlying financial assets including common stocks currencies and stock indexes new york portfolio clearing a clearing house created by nyse and the depository trust amp clearing corporation dtcc clears interest rate futures contracts and crossmargins eligible positions against us treasury and agency securities and repurchase agreements cleared by dtccs subsidiary fixed income clearing corporation we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services especially in light of doddfranks clearing mandate we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the fees charged for the services provided quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies competition in our market data business technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data or trading software systems these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 11table of contentsregulatory matters our operation of futures exchanges is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under a principlesbased approach which requires that our exchange subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house but also as a result of recent regulations under a highly prescriptive regulatory regime the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years and is scheduled for reconsideration in 2013 in light of widespread financial and economic difficulties in the us and abroad particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there were calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets doddfrank which was signed into law in 2010 is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded doddfrank reinforces the core tenets of our markets price transparency liquid markets to minimize transaction costmarket integritycustomer protection and the safety and soundness of central counterparty clearing servicessince the adoption of doddfrank the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in the evolving global financial markets over the past two years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting the definition of agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets while we continue to believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to make the necessary changes to our business to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations stemming from these events our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are changes to the core principles for designated contract markets including any changes to the rules implementing the competitive execution requirements of core principle 9 rules promulgated under this provision may require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps after a specified compliance periodchanges to the selfregulatory model which if modified could alter the manner in which we currently oversee our marketplace we believe that we are best positioned to continue to conduct financial and market surveillance of our clearing firms the implementation of the position limit rules which could have a significant impact on our commodities business relative to such markets abroad given that it does not appear that foreign jurisdictions will impose position limits rules as stringent as those adopted by the cftc although the cftc adopted new position limits they were subsequently vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia and remanded back to the cftc concerns regarding the one size fits all rules for capital charges implementing basel iii as well as whether we will be deemed a qualified central counterparty and the risk that these new standards may impose overly burdensome capital requirements on our clearing members and customers which may eliminate the incentives to trade liquid exchangetraded derivatives instead of other derivatives products with higher risk profilesthe potential elimination of the 6040 tax treatment of certain of our derivatives contracts which would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to our market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity the implementation of mechanisms to further protect customer funds at the futures commission merchant level and to restore confidence in the derivatives markets 12table of contentspursuant to doddfrank in july 2012 the financial stability oversight council designated cme due its operation of our us clearing house as a systemically important financial market utility which carries with it additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities in 2012 we began operating a registered swap data repository service that is subject to the oversight of the cftc and we must comply with certain core principles under the commodity exchange act as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business the financial services industry outside of the united states is also undergoing similar significant change particularly in europe for example in the united kingdom the government has proposed to reorganize its regulatory framework which would include the dissolution of the fsa with oversight to be transitioned in april 2013 to the bank of england the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority depending upon the status of the regulated entity as a result in the united kingdom our operations could be subject to multiple regulators cme clearing europe limited our uk clearing house would be regulated by the bank of england cme europe limited our proposed uk exchange would be regulated by the financial conduct authority and cme our us clearing house would be regulated by the european securities and markets authority esma as an overseas clearing house the european union is also undergoing similar change with multiple supervisory authorities such as esma established in 2011 in addition to the national regulators esma has a supervisory and oversight role over european clearing houses noneuropean clearing houses noneuropean exchanges european trade repositories and noneuropean trade repositories providing services in europe multiple legislations such as the european market infrastructure regulation the markets in financial instruments directive the capital requirements directive iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank compliance with these new regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization in 2012 notifications from one of our market data distributors made in accordance with the requirements of our market data license agreement included disclosures that such distributor had disseminated our market data to the government trading corporation gtc and to a european subsidiary of the national iranian oil company nioc in 2012 the gross revenues attributable to these indirect subscriptions made through the distributor were 3150 the terms and conditions on which the market data was disseminated by the distributor to gtc and nioc are the same as would be provided to any other indirect subscriber other than the execution of a uniform subscriber addendum that is made available to all of our distributors for use with their subscribers we do not have any contractual or other relationship with gtc or nioc we believe that the distribution of our market data which is otherwise publicly available in other forms on our web site on a realtime and delayed basis is exempt from applicable us sanctions programs pursuant to a statutory and regulatory exemption for exports of information and informational materials nevertheless we are in the process of requesting that our market data distributors refrain from providing our market data to their subscribers that are located in sanctioned countries or identified on the us treasury departments specially designated nationals and blocked persons list the distribution of our market data to gtc and nioc is subject to disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshr act and section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act which requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction disclosure is required whether or not the activities are sanctionable under us law in connection with these disclosures we will be required to separately file concurrently with this annual report a notice that such activities have been disclosed in this report which notice must also contain the information required by section 13r of the exchange act there continues to be significant focus among the cftc sec and foreign regulators relating to perceived risks level playing field considerations and potential market abuses associated with algorithmic trading and high frequency trading following recent highly publicized technical problems including the 2010 flash crash and the significant losses incurred by knight capital although not clearly defined high frequency trading typically refers to professional traders acting in a proprietary capacity that engage in strategies that generate a large number of trades on a daily basis the cftc has formed a subcommittee to define high frequency trading within the context of automated trading systems determine the appropriateness 13table of contentsof creating multiple categories for high frequency traders conduct an analysis of the oversight surveillance and economic aspects and identify potential market disruptions that could be provoked by such traders and possible mitigations we believe and there is considerable supporting evidence that high frequency traders play an important role in the marketplace by increasing liquidity narrowing spreads and enhancing the efficiency of markets at this time however it is unclear whether these inquires will result in restrictions on the use of high frequency trading in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our contract volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition to andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to our market participants

geographic location beginning in september 2011 we began tracking trading volume based on the country of origin of the transaction as disclosed to us by the customer prior to september 2011 we tracked trading volume based on the time of the execution of the trade and whether it occurred during traditional us trading hours or through our international telecommunication hubs in 2012 we estimate that approximately 21 of our electronic trading volume originated from outside of the united states the following table shows the percentage of our total contract volume on our globex electronic trading

this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks that we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business risks relating to our industry our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including economic political and geopolitical market conditions volatile weather patterns droughts natural disasters and other catastrophes broad trends in industry and finance changes in price levels contract volumes and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying equity foreign exchange interest rate and commodity markets changes in global or regional demand or supply shifts in commodities underlying our products legislative and regulatory changes including any direct or indirect restrictions on or increased costs associated with trading in our markets competition changes in government monetary policies especially central bank decisions related to quantitative easing availability of capital to our market participants and their appetite for risktakinglevels of assets under management andconsolidation in our customer base and within our industryany one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of heightened uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our performance in recent years in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital during 2012 the us economy remained constrained due to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election the pending fiscal cliff and fears of global recession europe also continues to face uncertainty with some eurozone countries in recession as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful the shifts in market trading patterns experienced since the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not persist and they will be affected by future economic uncertainties including the pending decisions regarding us spending central bank asset purchase activity and currency management policies around the world all of these uncertainties as well as new surprises may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating resultswe operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and such environment is currently undergoing significant reform our business has been extensively regulated by the cftc in response to the economic crisis the doddfrank act was signed into law in 2010 this legislation is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded in accordance with doddfrank the cftcs authority has been significantly expanded to include overthecounter derivatives since the adoption of doddfrank the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in our evolving global financial markets over the 17table of contentspast two years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting the definition of agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets while we continue to believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business including changes to core principle 9 the implementation of basel iii and its one size fits all rules for capital charges as well as greater capital charges that will apply if we are not deemed a qualified central counterparty may impose overly burdensome capital requirements on our bankaffiliated clearing members and customers which could eliminate the incentives to trade liquid exchangetraded derivatives instead of other derivatives products with higher risk profiles the local rules implementing these international standards have not been finalized we will comply with cftc regulations that will be issued and therefore we expect to be deemed a qualified central counterparty when those regulations are effective however to the extent that we are not deemed a qualified central counterparty during the interim period or thereafter it could result in increased costs to our bankaffiliated clearing members and result in them electing to clear their business at another qualified central counterparty or imposing increased costs on customers that prefer to clear at cmeadditionally the futures industry its selfregulatory model and the segregation and customer protection regime are under scrutiny by the cftc and congress several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds our operation of a registered swap data repository also subjects us to additional oversight of the cftc and we must comply with additional core principles relating to the operation of this newly formed regulated business as a global company with operations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by any of these regulatory agencies our subsidiaries cme clearing europe cme marketing europe and cme europe limited subject to obtaining fsa approval are also subject to the supervision and oversight of the fsa and in the future by the bank of england and the financial conduct authority which will replace the fsa the regulatory environment in the united kingdom and the european union is undergoing significant reforms in connection with the oversight of the financial services industry in response to the economic crisis a number of financial service legislations covering issues similar to those included in doddfrank have also been proposed in europe as we continue to expand our operations in the united kingdom with our uk clearing house and proposed uk exchange changes in the european including the uk regulatory environment will have a greater impact on our business compliance with these new regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is a discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our contract volumes revenues and profits and also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to our market participants who are responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets 18table of contentssome of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits could be adversely affected we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank gives the cftc authority to require certain swaps to be cleared by central clearing houses and to require certain of those swaps mandated for clearing to be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for clearing while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges and less regulated trading platforms have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others our principal competitors include other exchanges such as nyse ice hkex and eurex group in addition recent industry developments and alliances such as elx have resulted in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment for example in december 2012 nyse and ice entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which ice would acquire nyse hkex completed its acquisition of the london metal exchange in 2012other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may respond more quickly to competitive pressures including responses based upon their corporate governance structures which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure develop products that are preferred by our customers develop risk transfer products that compete with our products price their products and services more competitively develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently utilize better more userfriendly and more reliable technology 19table of contentstake greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities more effectively market promote and sell their products and services better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services and exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business modelif our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability changes in regulations as a result of implementation of the doddfrank act and other restructuring of the regulation of the global financial markets or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete especially on a global basis our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies including lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity paymentsrebates they provide as an incentive for providers of liquidity in certain markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms if we are unable to effectively compete we could experience decreased volumes the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers two firms each represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2012 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected the shortfall in customer segregated funds at mf global and the misappropriation of customer property at peregrine financial group inc pfg may have an impact on the overall confidence in the futures markets which could have a negative impact on contract volume furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide for example we served as the designated self regulatory organization for mf global there are ongoing investigations by the department of justice the fbi the cftc and the sec into the events surrounding the mf global bankruptcy including determining which individuals and entities may have civil or criminal liability for the shortfall we continue to believe that we acted appropriately and that our actions do not give rise to liability we have been named as a party to a number of lawsuits in connection with the mf global matter which have been consolidated there is no guarantee that we will not become the subject of additional litigation relating to the matter or that we will be successful in defending against these claims or any other action relating to mf global or any matter brought in the future we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 20table of contentsour role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk than other companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems recently groups have targeted the financial services industry as part of their protest against the perceived lack of regulation of the financial sector and economic inequality including calls to their supporters to launch cyber attacks on numerous financial institutions which in some cases have resulted in brief outages to their external corporate web sites our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security risks additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group plead guilty to theft of our trade secrets while we do not believe that any customer information trade data or required regulatory information was compromised in this incident and we have no evidence that the trade secrets were distributed in connection with this matter we cannot assure you that we will not be the subject of future malfeasance other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operationsalthough we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security breaches such as computer viruses and similar information technology violations that are typical for a company of our size that operates in the global financial marketplace as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against such cyber attacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower contract volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results risks relating to our business the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to provide reliable and costeffective services to our customers develop in a timely manner the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities 21table of contentsattract independent software vendors to write frontend software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors and generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platformif we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers slower response times delays in our customers trade execution failed settlement of trades incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades financial losses security breaches litigation or other customer claims loss of customers and regulatory sanctions we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market for example our colocation facility hosts a significant portion of our customers infrastructure while we have undertaken measures to secure such facility and to implement disaster recovery measures if we were to experience an outage at such location it could have a significant impact on our revenues and reputationfrom time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without 22table of contentsfailure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us our clearing house operations expose us to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers over the last few years the global financial markets have experienced significant uncertainty and negative conditions as a result of the continued financial crisis that began in 2008 as a result many of our customers have encountered credit limitations losses resulting from lower asset values consolidations legislative changes and reduced liquidity we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one of our clearing firms as part of our overall growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including products offered for clearing through cme clearport and our credit default swap and interest rate swap clearing initiatives the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures and options on futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our other financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect market participants from the unique risks of these products or ensure that our financial safeguards will suffice to cover clearing member defaults in extreme circumstances in 2011 cme clearing europe was launched while we have hired experienced management to oversee the operations of cme clearing europe as an organization we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a 100 million fund designed to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry 23table of contentsparticipants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances when their clearing firm member becomes insolvent the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements with our clearing house as collateral for its trading activity we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue recent regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from third party price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation following the wellpublicized issues relating to the credibility of libor there has been heightened scrutiny surrounding the integrity and potential manipulation of libor and other benchmarks which are derived from price reporting agencies our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenuesour market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenues we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions excluding our index market data offerings revenues from our market data and information services represented 12 and 10 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively a decrease in overall contract volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example in both 2012 and 2011 we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions investments or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other assets classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be 24table of contentsable to operate profitably under the new legislation for example provisions within doddfrank include changes to the cftcs core principles specifically core principal 9 which could require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including ices offering for credit default swaps we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful we intend to continue to explore acquisitions investments and other strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we may also be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively impact our stock price expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including through cme clearing europe our proposed uk exchange directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight tariffs and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries and potentially adverse tax consequencesin addition as a result of our expanding global operations we are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities including the fsa in connection with cme clearing europe our marketing efforts in europe and our proposed uk exchange these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk 25table of contentsof significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in february 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our initial review of the complaint we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures to generate liquidity could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group plead guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 26table of contentsrisks relating to an investment in our class a common stock our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 29 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 18 billion our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund capital expenditures to pursue acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitorsthe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our exchanges and clearing house are also required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc at least equal to six months of their applicable operating expenses any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in february 2012 sampp lowered our rating to aa with a negative outlook from aa with a negative outlook the ratings action stemmed from the newly provided protection we extended to trading customers of defaulted clearing member firms the continued negative outlook reflects sampps view of the potential legal and reputational fallout from the mf global bankruptcy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital our investment in bmampfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk we own an interest in bmampfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares which had a fair value of 6906 million as of december 31 2012 as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its contract volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk there is no guarantee that our investment in bmampfbovespa will be profitable any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash writedowns and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity in connection with our acquisitions and investments including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in the past we have recorded impairment charges in connection with some of our investments including our investment in bmampfbovespa we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 27table of contentsour average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically than for trades executed on the trading floor in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected eighteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business eighteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2012 79 of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any our members and permit holders have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges and in connection with our agreement to acquire kcbt our members and permit holders have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including

potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year the annual variable dividend for 2013 was accelerated

50 billion and our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividendsfor example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders equity as of september 30 2012 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2012

competitive environment our industry is highly competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of

derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 doddfrank is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted we continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage pursuant to doddfrank in july 2012 the financial stability oversight council has designated cme as a systemically important financial market utility because it is operating as a us clearing house this designation creates additional regulatory oversight over our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe is also undergoing similar regulatory reform which could result in additional regulation over our european operations business

partners andrevenuesclearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues rate structureproduct mixvenue andthe percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customersrate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading and clearing platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floormembernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 37table of

changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities stockbased

in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be 39table of contentscritical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value level 1inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include us treasury securities equity securities listed in active markets and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market priceslevel 2inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds assetbacked securities us government agency securities and certain derivativeslevel 3inputs are unobservable and reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability generally assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs include certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require managements judgmentfor further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trendsintangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests40table of contentsincome taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or

generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended userecent accounting pronouncementsin december 2011 and january 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued updates to existing rules over balance sheet offsetting disclosure the updates require entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain financial

nonoperating income increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily as a result of the net gain from the contribution of the dji asset group to samppdji and the sale of cma in addition we began recognizing our proportionate share of net income from our venture with mcgraw in july 2012 the decrease in nonoperating expense in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the 4205 million term loan in january 2011 and the maturity of the 3000 million floating rate notes in august 2010in 2011 we reduced our income tax provision due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in state tax apportionment this revaluation contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 and a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 when compared with 2010 the increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 was also due to the establishment of deferred tax liabilities associated

the longterm interest rate products including the eurodollar back 32 futures and the treasury bond futures and options contracts was attributable to periods of higher longterm interest rate volatility

higher volatility in early 2012in 2011 when compared with 2010 the overall increase in interest rate contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by a change in market expectations regarding shortterm and longterm interest rates tied to the federal reserves announcement in 2011 that it intended to maintain its zero interest rate policy through 2013 in addition volatility caused by the

due to the continued zero interest rate policywe also believe that overall us treasury futures and options contract volume increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to institutional portfolio adjustments caused by the downgrade of the united states credit rating many institutional portfolios are required to maintain an average minimum overall credit rating when the us treasury credit rating was downgraded the institutional portfolios had to sell investments with lower credit ratings and buy more us treasuries in order to increase their average minimum overall credit rating in addition the growth in overall us treasury futures and options contract volume was attributable to increased demand for us treasury securities as a safe haven investment during the european credit

market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index the decline in volatility was the result of few new developments in the macroeconomic environment within the united states and european markets we believe a decline in assets under management also contributed to a decrease in volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 in 2011 when compared with 2010 an overall increase in volatility contributed to higher equity contract volume we believe the periods of high volatility within the equity markets during the third quarter of 2011were attributable to the downgrade of the united states

contract volume we believe trading activity in euro contracts was impacted by the lack of a directional trend due to uncertainty related to the health of the european union and concern regarding additional economic stimulus provided by the federal reserve the lack of a trend has reduced trading in euro contracts among customers who trade based on medium to longterm expectations we believe th uncertainty with the european union also contributed to a decline in british pound contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 because the british economy is closely tied to the european union we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate beginning in mid2011 through 2012 caused market participants to reduce their trading in japanese yen contracts and to focus on higher yielding currencies such as the australian and canadian dollarsin 2011 when compared with 2010 foreign exchange contract volume remained at a consistent level we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate and uncertainty about the euro as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis caused the market to move to safe haven currencies such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar as a result euro and japanese yen contract volume decreased while australian dollar volume increased44table of

attributable to higher volatility resulting from severe drought conditions in the midwest in the second and third quarters of 2012 we believe the increased volatility was the result of supply constraint concerns for soybean and wheat supplies corn volumes declined slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 early market expectations of excess supply in 2012 dampened corn price volatility in early 2012 which resulted in the decline in volumewe believe that the increase in contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to a decline in supply due to various weather events including flooding drought and excessive heat the change in supply resulted in increased volatility and higher grain prices we also believe that the increase in volume resulted from increased demand

slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 a decline in crude oil contract volume resulting from lower price volatility contributed to an overall decrease in energy products volume political unrest in the middle east in the first quarter of 2011 resulted in changes in global supply which contributed to higher price volatility in early 2011 relative to 2012 additionally lower crude oil contract volume in 2012 was partially attributable to oversupply in cushing oklahoma we believe that the reversal of the seaway pipeline in the second quarter of 2012 and ongoing capacity increases in the pipeline will continue to relieve oversupply and provide needed infrastructure for ongoing expected north american crude oil supply increases however uncertainty remains over the timing and extent of the impact the reversal will have on the overall crude oil market the decrease in crude oil contract volume was partially offset by an increase in natural gas contract volume the increase in natural gas contract volume resulted largely from volatility around production shifts in the early part of 2012 refined products growth is due to increased volatility caused by a growing us export market as global oil markets adapt to increased supply of north american crude oil despite refinery shutdownsin 2011 when compared with 2010 we believe the increase in energy contract volume was attributable to increased price volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2011 we also believe that increased volatility caused by weatherrelated events led to an increase in natural gas

precious metals markets in 2012 when compared with 2011 we believe the august 2011 announcement of the federal reserves intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy and deepening eurozone worries which caused high volatility within other financial markets in 2011 resulted in an increased interest in precious metals as an asset class this increased interest in 2011 resulted in relative decreases in gold and silver contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume for copper contracts as a result of economic growth in asia as well as global supply constraintsthe overall increase in metal contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to the increased investment in precious metals as an asset class due to high volatility and uncertainty within the financial markets we believe that there was an increase in silver contract volume due to the greater use of silver as an alternative investmentaverage rate per contractthe average rate per contract increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2012 agricultural commodity and energy product volumes when

fees compared with interest rate products and equity productsin 2011 when compared with 2010 the average rate per contract decreased due to an increase in member contract volume which increased faster

services and cma in the second quarter of 2012 the dji asset group including assets which generated market data and information services revenue was contributed to the mcgraw venture and cma was sold to mcgraw in addition the decrease in revenue was due to a decline in the basic device count in 2012 due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms the decrease in market data and information

addition revenues from index services increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to growth in assets under management which was driven by underlying index market performance the overall increase in
