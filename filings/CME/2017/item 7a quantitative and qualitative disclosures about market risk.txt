manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our cme globex electronic trading platform from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access us trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our us futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our us exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2016 82 of our contract volume was conducted by our members the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13 and another firm represented 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2016 in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse directive basel iii and various other laws and regulationsplease also refer to the discussion below and in the risk factors section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 9table of contentscompetition in our derivatives business we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others brand and reputationefficient and secure settlement clearing and support servicesdepth and liquidity of markets breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development and innovative services ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs efficient and seamless customer experiencetransparency reliability and anonymity in transaction processing regulatory environmentconnectivity accessibility and distribution technological capability and innovation andtransaction costs we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business for example the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain cleared swaps and privately negotiated products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our exchangetraded and privately negotiated productsadditionally we face competition from substitute offerings these substitutes can take the form of swaps contracts identical or similar to our listed futures contracts or risksimilar products on spot and cash markets securities and securities options exchanges exchange traded funds and other instruments and other venues and mechanisms that can serve to offset economic risks competition in our transaction processing business in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank basel iii and other various laws and regulations our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchclearnet ltd the options clearing corporation depository trust amp clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services we believe competition in transaction processing and business services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services providedcompetition in our market data business technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products  10table of contentsalthough we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable productregulatory matters we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens please also refer to the discussion below and in the risk factors section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertaintiesregulation in the united statesour operation of us futures exchanges and our clearing houses is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires that our regulated subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing houses cme clearing europe registered with the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization in november 2016 the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations over the past five years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore in november 2016 the united states held elections which resulted in the republican presidential candidate donald trump being elected as the 45th president of the united states and the republican party maintaining control of both houses of the us congress at this time we cannot predict the effect the result of the election will have on current or pending us regulations relating to the financial services industry our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc regulation in the united kingdom and the european unionin the united kingdom our operations are subject to multiple regulators the bank of england the fca and esma cme clearing our us clearing house is subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma in the european union we also are subject to several supervisory authorities for financial services including esma multiple directives and regulations such as mifid ii and changes to the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the capital requirements regulations iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed and in certain circumstances implemented with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which uk voters voted in favor of withdrawal from the european union brexit the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european unionkey areas of focuswe actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are the adoption and implementation of position limit rules which could have a significant impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent limitations  11table of contentsrules respecting capital charges under basel iii with respect to clearing members of central counterparties there is a risk that these new standards may impose overly burdensome capital requirements on our clearing members and customers additional risks could arise through inconsistent adoption of the basel iii capital charges globally potentially leading to disparate impacts on our customersthe potential impact of the eu equivalence and recognition regime on noneuropean union clearinghouses and exchanges with customers based in europe the potential for further regulation stemming from industry performance disruptions and residual concerns around electronic trading activity and in particular high frequency tradingthe potential elimination of the 6040 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts which would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity the implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the united states or european union which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdictionregulations implementing the core principles for designated contract markets including any changes to the rules implementing the competitive execution requirements of core principle 9 rules promulgated under this provision may require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps after a specified compliance periodthe implementation of legislation in the european union impacting how benchmark index prices are formed including new requirements for price submitters price aggregators and markets that list contracts that reference index prices concerns that legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts the implementation of rules resulting in negative treatment of the liquidity profile of us treasury securities including as qualifying liquidity resources or any potential limitation on the use of us treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs

of contentsitem 1a risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business risks relating to our industry our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including economic political and geopolitical market conditions legislative and regulatory changes including any direct or indirect restrictions on or increased costs associated with trading in our markets broad trends in the industry and financial markets changes in price levels contract volumes and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying equity foreign exchange interest rate and commodity markets shifts in global or regional demand or supply in commodities underlying our products competition changes in government monetary policies especially central bank decisions related to quantitative easing availability of capital to our market participants and their appetite for risktakinglevels of assets under management volatile weather patterns droughts natural disasters and other catastrophes pandemics affecting our customer base or our ability to operate our markets andconsolidation in our customer base and within our industryany one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating resultswe operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business moreover in the aftermath of the 2016 us presidential election the us government has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulation while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1  business  regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the  14table of contentsextensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other reforms could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do our competitors may respond more quickly to competitive pressures including responses based upon their corporate governance structures which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure develop products that are preferred by our customers develop risk transfer products that compete with our products price their products and services more competitively develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently utilize better more userfriendly and more reliable technology take greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities more effectively market promote and sell their products and services better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services and exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business modelif our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability please see item 1  business  competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13 and another firm represented 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2016 should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely  15table of contentstransfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attackwe regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other information security threats we experience cyberattacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by regulators in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costsadditionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property and persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use or steal our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations in the past we have been the victim of trade secret theft by an employee as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our technology infrastructure and employees against such cyberattacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilitiesas a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on the ability to bring private causes of actions in cases where we have not acted in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impairing our profitability some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions  16table of contentsestablished on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options on futures from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results risks relating to our business damage to our reputation could damage our businessmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from trading disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations third party suppliers misconduct and ineffective risk management the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers in 2016 88 of our overall volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to provide reliable and costeffective services to our customers develop in a timely manner the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets maintain the competitiveness of our fee structure attract independent software vendors to write frontend software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors and generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform 17table of contentsif we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers slower response times and delays in our customers trade execution and processing failed settlement of trades incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades financial losses security breaches litigation or other customer claims loss of customers and regulatory sanctions we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing  18table of contentsvolume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from third party price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenuesour market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11 and 12 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively a  19table of contentsdecrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2016 and 2015 we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results we plan to continue to expand our global operations directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries and potentially adverse tax consequenceswe cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations and to our european expansion is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united  20table of contentskingdom and the european union brexit may result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the withdrawal process progresses this could increase legal compliance and operational costsour compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in the past misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in the past a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry  21table of contentsin general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 22 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 23 billion our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund capital expenditures to pursue acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitorsthe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states subject us to currency risk since we conduct business outside of the united states primarily in the united kingdom portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currenciesour average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially  22table of contentsour cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected thirteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business thirteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2016 82 of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to

houses clear settle and guarantee futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies in addition cme serves as a swap execution facility which is a regulated platform for swap trading and serves as a swap data repository which provides public data on swap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes  29table of contentsbusiness trendseconomic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management changes in the us presidential administration as well as the federal reserve banks interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment competitive environment our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development our ability to position and expand upon existing products transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers regulatory environment exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over the last several years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have passed laws and regulations that apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability our us futures exchanges and our clearing houses are subject to extensive regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last five years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized we believe that the regulations provide opportunities for our business our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service is also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations in november 2016 the united states held elections which resulted in the republican presidential candidate donald trump being elected as the 45th president of the united states and the republican party maintaining control of both houses of the us congress at this time we cannot predict the effect the result of the election will have on current or pending us regulations relating to the financial services industry as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now overseen by several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities market authority esma in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters decided in favor of withdrawal from the european union the ultimate impact of this referendum in regards to the laws and regulations applicable to our european operations remains unclear and is contingent on the terms of the withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe as well as the effects of this referendum business strategyour strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7  30table of contentsrevenuesclearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue rate structureproduct mixvenue andthe percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customersrate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate and credit default swap contracts rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through cme clearport and exchange for related positions efrpsmembernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and

operationscritical accounting policiesthe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value level 1inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date level 2inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active level 3inputs are unobservable and reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at level 3 fair value generally include assets and liabilities with inputs that require managements judgmentfor further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 18 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given  33table of contentsthe information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trendsintangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows only if there are indicators of a change in circumstances if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requestsincome taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended userecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous industryspecific requirements and converges us accounting standards with international financial reporting standards the new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards the new standard also

retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption the modified retrospective approach we are on course to comply with the guidance by the effective date we are currently in the contract review phase which is expected to be completed by mid2017 we expect to reach a conclusion on whether there will be changes in revenue recognition which method of adoption will be used and the impact the guidance will have on policies process and controls towards the end of 2017 in january 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that will change how entities measure certain equity investments it does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans under the new guidance entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements in february 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases the guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current us gaap under the new guidance a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months consistent with current us gaap the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements in march 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that will change certain aspects of accounting for sharebased payments to employees the guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled it will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employees shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we will implement this standards update in the first quarter of 2017 and update our disclosure according to the new requirementsin june 2016 the fasb issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments the standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset this forwardlooking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses the standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time the standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 the standards provisions must be applied as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning in 2019 we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statementsin november 2016 the fasb issued a standards update aimed at promoting consistency in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows previously there was diversity in practice as to whether the change in restricted cash was included in the reconciliation of beginningofperiod and endofperiod total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents as well as amounts described as restricted cash on the balance sheet this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the amendments must be applied using a retrospective

regarding the federal reserves interest rate policy and the anticipation of the united kingdoms european union membership referendum contributed to considerable volatility in the second half of 2016 volume across most of our products lines spiked in the fourth quarter as the us presidential and congressional elections injected considerable uncertainty into the markets following the election there was a shift in expectations regarding future corporate income tax rates infrastructure spending national debt levels and inflation concerns the anticipation of the federal open market committee meetings in the fourth quarter of 2016 in which the federal funds rate was raised by 25 basis points contributed to further volatility in the second half of 2016crude oil volumes continued to grow throughout 2016 as crude oil market volatility remained high throughout the year the crude oil markets continued to show considerable uncertainty in early 2016 regarding the direction of future oil prices as global supplies continued to remain high which resulted in significant contract volume increases in the energy market in the fourth quarter of 2016 the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec decided to cut oil production which led to a sharp increase in oil pricesoverall futures and options contract volume increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by an increase in energy contract volume the fall in crude oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through 2015 and resulted in several periods of high volatility throughout 2015 volatility was heavily influenced by the increase in global crude oil supplies which outpaced demand 37table of contentsinterest rate productsthe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key

compared with 2015 largely due to periods of high interest rate volatility throughout the year particularly within the first and fourth quarter of 2016 we believe the high volatility resulted from the continued uncertainty throughout early 2016 around changes to the federal reserves interest rate policy in the nearterm interest rate volatility also remained high throughout the fourth quarter of 2016 due to market uncertainty resulting from the us presidential and congressional elections in november and the increase in the federal funds rate following the federal open market committees meeting in december in addition electronic eurodollar options volumes increased in 2016 due to our continued investment in system enhancements and increased client adoption of electronic options tradingin 2015 when compared with 2014 overall interest rate volumes decreased due to a decline in longerdated interest rate contract volume as market participants anticipated a potential change in interest rates in the near term in 2015 we believe these participants shifted their focus from back 32 eurodollar futures and longerdated us treasury futures and options to shorter term products including the 2year us treasury futures and options while interest rate volatility remained high in early 2015 changes in macroeconomic factors and a shift from the first quarters expectations regarding the federal reserve interest rate policy change lowered interest rate volatility throughout the remainder of 2015 equity productsthe following table summarizes average daily contract volume

271 272 312  13we believe the increase in overall equity contract volume in 2016 when compared with 2015 resulted from periods of high market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index throughout 2016 during 2016 the equity markets experienced periods of higher volatility due to the continued ambiguity surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy uncertainty surrounding the united kingdoms european union membership referendum and declining global crude oil prices the results of the us presidential and congressional elections injected new uncertainty into the markets in the fourth quarter of 2016 which we believe led to additional volatility overall equity contract volume remained flat in 2015 when compared with 2014 because volatility remained high in both periods global economic events led by a deceleration of the chinese economy in the second half of 2015 resulted in high market volatility in 2015 in 2014 high volatility resulted from geopolitical events in russia ukraine and the middle east the emini nasdaq contract volumes from 2014 through 2016 did not benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent as the emini sampp 500 because the emini nasdaq contract generally hedges different market risks compared with the market risks hedged by the emini sampp 500 contracts 38table of contentsforeign exchange

volume remained relatively flat the decline in euro contract volume resulted from low volatility which we believe resulted from a lack of global macroeconomic drivers meaningfully affecting the euro in 2016 the decline in euro contract volume was partially offset by an increase in british pound contract volume which we believe was caused by volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom european union membership referendum in mid2016foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase in euro contract volume caused by quantitative easing and debt concerns in europe global economic uncertainty geopolitical events as well as a strengthening us dollar throughout 2015 we believe these factors led to increases in

contracts in 2016 2015 and 2014 clearing and transaction fees generated from these contracts were 620 million 670 million and 595 million respectively the decrease in revenue in 2016 when compared with 2015 was largely attributable to a reduction in client activity after the first quarter of 2015 as we believe some customers chose alternative products and venues to manage risk the increase in revenue in 2015 compared with 2014 was largely attributable to increased sales efforts centered around customer education concentration of revenuewe bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one

represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm other sources of revenuemarket data and information services beginning in 2016 the partial fee waivers that existed in 2015 ended contributing to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2016

effective tax rate in 2016 when compared with 2015 was due to an implementation of strategies to realize additional income tax benefits from the investment in bmampfbovespa stock the overall decrease

of 2016the effective tax rate in 2015 was relatively flat compared with the effective tax rate in 2014 because the deferred income tax benefit resulting from remeasurement of the deferred income tax
