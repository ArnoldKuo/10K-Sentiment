members the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2014 in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange  9table of contentscompetition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse directive basel iii and various other laws and regulationsplease also refer to the discussion below and in the risk factors section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertaintiescompetition in our derivatives business we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others reputationefficient and secure settlement clearing and support servicesdepth and liquidity of markets breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs transparency reliability and anonymity in transaction processing regulatory environmentconnectivity accessibility and distribution technological capability and innovation andtransaction costs we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business for example the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain cleared swaps and privately negotiated products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our exchangetraded and privately negotiated productsadditionally we face competition from substitute markets these substitutes can take the form of swaps contracts identical or similar to our listed futures contracts or risksimilar products on spot and cash markets securities exchanges exchange traded funds and other instruments and other venues and mechanisms that can serve to offset economic risks competition in our transaction processing business in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the continued implementation of and compliance with doddfrank our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchswapclear the options clearing corporation depository trust amp clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of doddfranks clearing mandate and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 10table of contentscompetition in our market data business technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities which could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable productregulatory matters we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens please also refer to the discussion below and in the risk factors section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertaintiesregulation in the united statesour operation of us futures exchanges and our us clearing house is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc which requires that our regulated subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations over the past four years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore however portions of doddfrank remain subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc regulation in the united kingdom and the european unionin the united kingdom the government approved a reorganization of its regulatory framework under which the financial services authority was dissolved and its oversight responsibilities were transitioned in 2013 primarily to the bank of england and the fca as a result in the united kingdom our operations are subject to multiple regulators the bank of england the fca and esma cme clearing our us clearing house is subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma the european union also is undergoing similar change establishing multiple supervisory authorities for financial services including esma multiple directives and regulations such as mifid ii and changes to the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the capital requirements regulations iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank key areas of focuswe actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are regulations implementing the core principles for designated contract markets including any changes to the rules implementing the competitive execution requirements of core principle 9 rules promulgated under this provision may require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps after a specified compliance period 11table of contentsthe adoption and implementation of position limit rules which could have a significant impact on our commodities business if comparable trading venues in foreign jurisdictions are not subject to equivalent limitations rules respecting capital charges under basel iii with respect to clearing members of central counterparties there is a risk that these new standards may impose overly burdensome capital requirements on our clearing members and customersthe criteria necessary to be deemed a qualifying central counterparty qccp a failure of our us clearing house to be deemed a qccp by banking regulators in the united states european union or otherwise may result in our clearing members and customers being subject to more stringent capital requirements thus creating a disincentive to use our markets the potential impact of mifid ii and mifir on noneu clearing houses with customers based in europe the potential elimination of the 6040 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts which would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity the implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the united states or european union which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdictionthe implementation of measures to further protect customer funds at the futures commission merchant level and to ensure confidence in the derivatives markets the potential for further regulation stemming from industry performance disruptions and residual concerns around electronic trading activity and in particular high frequency trading the implementation of legislation in the european union impacting how benchmark index prices are formed including new requirements for price submitters price aggregators and markets that list contracts that reference index prices concerns that legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts the implementation of rules regarding enhanced liquidity management standards for systemically important derivatives clearing organizations and any potential limitation on the use of us treasury securities as collateral significant limitations on the use of us treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs to us and our clearing firms employees as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 2680 employees we

risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business risks relating to our industry our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including economic political and geopolitical market conditions legislative and regulatory changes including any direct or indirect restrictions on or increased costs associated with trading in our markets broad trends in the industry and financial markets changes in price levels contract volumes and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying equity foreign exchange interest rate and commodity markets  14table of contentsshifts in global or regional demand or supply in commodities underlying our products competition changes in government monetary policies especially central bank decisions related to quantitative easing availability of capital to our market participants and their appetite for risktakinglevels of assets under management volatile weather patterns droughts natural disasters and other catastrophes pandemics affecting our customer base or our ability to operate our markets andconsolidation in our customer base and within our industryany one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating resultswe operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1  business  regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected  15table of contentswe face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other portions of doddfrank and the regulatory structure being implemented could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do our competitors may respond more quickly to competitive pressures including responses based upon their corporate governance structures which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure develop products that are preferred by our customers develop risk transfer products that compete with our products price their products and services more competitively develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently utilize better more userfriendly and more reliable technology take greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities more effectively market promote and sell their products and services better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services and exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business modelif our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability please see item 1  business  competition beginning on page 10 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2014 should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in  16table of contentscontract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems groups have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security risks from time to time we experienced cyber security events including malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size additionally in 2013 we were the victim of a cyber intrusion although we maintain sophisticated systems teams and processes to prevent such incidents and took significant actions to address this incident we learned that certain customer information was compromised we incurred expenses of 160 million related to our response to the 2013 event any future alleged incidents could result in substantial costs and liability to us and diversions of our resources may distract the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and could result in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by the regulators additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our environment and infrastructure against such cyber attacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilities we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  17table of contentsrisks relating to our business the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to provide reliable and costeffective services to our customers develop in a timely manner the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets match fees of our competitors attract independent software vendors to write frontend software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors and generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platformif we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers slower response times delays in our customers trade execution failed settlement of trades incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades financial losses security breaches litigation or other customer claims loss of customers and regulatory sanctions we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market  18table of contentsfrom time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers firms in the financial industry have experienced significant uncertainty and negative conditions as a result of the continued fallout from the financial crisis of 2008 we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms as part of our growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to swaps in addition to standard futures and options on futures products the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for cleared swaps differs from our historical practices although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and establishing financial safeguards for cleared swaps there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect the clearing house in the event of a clearing member default during extreme market conditions  19table of contentsa substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenuesour market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11 of our total revenues during both the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 a decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2014 and 2013 we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals in 2014 we implemented a series of policy changes and price increases effective over 2014 and 2015 we cannot guarantee that the changes or increased cost to our customers will not result in a reduction of the total number of paid subscriptions as users review their business needs for our services we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth there is no guarantee that our cleared swaps initiatives will be successful our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the marketplace for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses we offer clearing services for cleared swaps including interest rate credit default foreign exchange and commodity swaps our strategy also includes extending our services into other asset classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our offerings the current regulatory  20table of contentsenvironment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the new legislation also numerous capital changes and provisions in basel iii may result in uncleared bilaterally executed derivatives being less expensive than cleared derivatives in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including new swap execution facilities we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results we plan to continue to expand our global operations including through cme clearing europe cme europe and our global repository services directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries and potentially adverse tax consequenceswe cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex  21table of contentsand two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  22table of contentsrisks relating to an investment in our class a common stock our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 21 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 18 billion our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund capital expenditures to pursue acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitorsthe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states could subject us to currency risk since we conduct business outside of the united states primarily in the united kingdom portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currenciesadditionally we have invested in businesses outside of the united states including our investment in bmampfbovespa which had a fair value of 4108 million as of december 31 2014 a decrease in value of the currencies in the foreign jurisdictions where we have investments would decrease the value of our investments and may have a negative impact on our financial statementsour quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in  23table of contentseach of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected

affect our profitability our futures exchanges and our us clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last four years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various new procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations as a global company with operations and locations

reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now overseen by several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities

development and cobranding across asset classesrevenuesclearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues rate structureproduct mixvenue andthe percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customersrate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and credit default rates are varied by product in

vary directly with overall contract volume compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for

policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value level 1inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include us treasury securities and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market priceslevel 2inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include assetbacked securities and certain derivativeslevel 3inputs are unobservable and reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at level 3 fair value generally include assets and liabilities with inputs that require managements judgmentfor further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trendsintangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of  35table of contentsthe amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requestsincome taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended userecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous industryspecific requirements and converges us accounting with international financial reporting standards the new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards the new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract the new standard will become effective in the first annual period beginning after december 15 2016 this guidance may be adopted using one of two

options contracts particularly with shortterm contracts we believe the growth was a result of increased volatility driven by changing expectations regarding nearterm federal reserve actions in addition we believe the growth in eurodollar options volume was attributable to increased sales efforts despite overall increases in interest rate volumes treasury bond volumes decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 us treasury volumes were high in the first half  38table of contentsof 2013 due to short periods of high volatility created by the federal reserves activities with respect to its quantitative easing program in 2013 when compared with 2012 overall interest rate contract volume increased largely due to an increase in volume for the eurodollar back 32 futures as well as the 5year and 10year us treasury contracts the increase in volume resulted from periods of high volatility in 2013 particularly in mid and longterm interest rates we believe the periods of mid and longterm interest rate volatility were attributable to changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit its quantitative easing strategy and to outline an exit strategy from its plan as well as a change in expectations regarding the federal reserves continued zero interest rate policy shortterm interest rate volatility remained low in 2013 compared with prior periods due to the federal reserves ongoing zero interest rate policy the federal reserves announcement in may 2013 that tapering might have occurred in 2013 resulted in an increase in shortterm interest rate volatility which contributed to a slight increase in eurodollar front 8 and eurodollar options contracts in 2013 compared with 2012 the federal reserves announcement had little effect on the 2year treasury volumes as market participants continued to focus primarily on midterm contracts such as the 5year and 10year treasury contracts equity productsthe following table summarizes average daily

futures and options 312 239 254 30 6we believe the increase in overall equity contract volume resulted from geopolitical events in russia and ukraine as well as the middle east that led to periods of relatively high volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index in the third quarter of 2014 we believe the increase in volume was also due to a more gradual increase in broad market volatility during the second half of 2014 caused by uncertainty surrounding interest rates and other geopolitical uncertainty the increase in the emini nasdaq100 contract volume was due to market participants shifting attention to the nasdaq100 index which had slightly higher volatility than the sampp 500 throughout most of the year equity contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to periods of higher volatility in early 2013 we believe higher volatility resulted from changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit its quantitative easing strategy we also believe the increase in equity contract volume in 2013 was due to a greater need for equity index futures and options contracts resulting from an increase in assets under management in equitybased funds the emini nasdaq contracts did not benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent as the emini sampp 500 because the emini nasdaq

believe subdued expectations regarding interest rate changes across european countries and japan led to a decrease in exchange rate volatility throughout these regions additionally we believe allegations regarding possible collusion by certain foreign exchange market participants in other marketplaces had a continued negative impact on overall global foreign exchange product trading during 2014 despite the overall decline in volume for the year volume did improve during the second half of 2014 largely due to volatility created by global economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk  39table of contentsthe overall increase in foreign exchange contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to an increase in japanese yen and british pound contract volumes the increase in japanese yen contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was largely due to higher volatility resulting from reduced efforts by the japanese central bank to control yen exchange rates in early 2013 in addition we believe increased volatility and economic uncertainty within great britain in 2013 contributed to an overall increase in british pound contract volumes in 2013 when compared with 2012 as a result of a decrease in demand for commodity resources in china because of an economic slowdown in the chinese market demand decreased for currencies from countries that heavily depend on raw material exports such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we believe the decrease in demand for these currencies resulted in a decrease in volume for the austrian dollar and canadian dollar contracts additionally euro contract volume decreased due to lower volatility when compared with 2012 as a result of concerns related to the european credit crisis in

wheat products the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012agricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to higher wheat contract volume in 2014 which we believe was caused by geopolitical concerns in russia and ukraine substantial increases in the production of corn and soybeans in 2014 encouraged hedgers to more aggressively seek protection against falling prices which we believe resulted in an increase in volumewe believe the overall decline in total agricultural commodity contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to fewer weatherrelated events in 2013 which resulted in higher grain supplies and movement toward a more normal historical supply and demand environment the overall decrease in agricultural commodity volume was partially offset by incremental wheat contract volume from the addition of kcbts hard red winter wheat contract to our product lineenergy

believe was attributable to low overall price levels resulting from increasing us energy production crude oil volume increased in 2014 particularly in the fourth quarter due to a shift in supply and demand which resulted in high volatility within the oil markets overall energy contract volumes remained flat in 2013 when compared with 2012 we believe crude oil contract volume increased due to improvements in distribution infrastructure we believe that revisions to our trading volume incentives program also contributed to an increase in crude oil contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 the decline in natural gas contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to lower volatility due to an increase in domestic supplies above forecasted amounts additionally natural gas contract volume declined in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to lower volatility caused by fewer weatherrelated events in early 2013 the decline in refined products contract volume in 2013

in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to lower price volatility prices remained stable due to a strengthening us dollar and the expectation of an increase in us interest rates in addition demand for gold continued to slow due to lower economic growth rates in india and china which are both large consumers of gold total metal contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 we believe the increase in metal contract volume was driven by periods of high price volatility caused by significant changes in macroeconomic market conditions and market sentiment toward gold and silver products improving economic conditions in the us the federal reserves stimulus policy as well as a change in demand in the asian markets contributed to an increase in copper contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012average rate per contractthe average rate per contract decreased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume interest rate product volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 4 percentage points in 2014 while all other product lines decreased interest rate contracts have a lower average rate per contract compared with other product lines in addition an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts also resulted in a decrease in the average rate per contract in 2014 when compared with 2013 the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2013 interest rate product volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 5 percentage points while agricultural commodity product volume decreased by 2 percentage points and equity and energy product volumes decreased by 1 percentage point each when compared with 2012 in addition the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 resulted from an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contractsconcentration of revenuewe bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014 one firm represented 11 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2013 two firms each represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2012 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm other sources of revenuemarket data and information services the increase in market data and information services revenues in 2014 when compared with 2013 was attributable to a 15 fee increase per device for basic realtime market data services at the beginning of 2014 the decline in market data and information services revenue in 2013 when compared with 2012 resulted from a decrease in market data and information services revenues from the dji asset group and cma in the second quarter of 2012 the dji asset group including assets which generated market data and information services revenue was contributed to the mcgraw venture and cma was sold to mcgraw in addition declines in the basic device count from 2012 to 2014 were due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms as well as continued utilization of a legacy incentive program partially offset the increase in 2014 when compared with 2013 and contributed to the decrease in 2013 when compared with 2012 the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 44 52 and 43 of our market data and information services revenue in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 41table of contentsaccess and communication fees we launched our colocation services in january 2012 the decreases in revenues from 2012 through 2014 were attributable to a decrease in other connection charges from customers who migrated over to our colocation program the overall decrease in 2014 when compared with 2013 was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our colocation program due to existing customers migrating from other connections in 2013 when compared with 2012 revenue generated from our colocation program decreased due to modifications to space and power requirements by customers during the first contract renewal period in early 2013 other revenue in 2014 we recognized 19 million in

financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include the accounts of the company and its majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are based on historical experience where applicable and assumptions management believes are reasonable under the circumstances due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates actual results may differ cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase financial investments the company maintains shortterm and longterm investments classified as availableforsale or trading securities availableforsale investments are carried at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income trading securities held in connection with nonqualified deferred compensation plans are recorded at fair value with net realized and unrealized gains and losses and dividend income reported as investment income also the company maintains longterm investments accounted for under the cost method and equity method depending upon the degree of influence over the investee as held by the company the company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is otherthantemporary if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of the assets has occurred and is deemed to be otherthantemporary the carrying value of the investments is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding impairment is charged to earnings  61table of contentsfair value of financial instruments the company uses a threelevel classification hierarchy of fair value measurements that establishes the quality of inputs used to measure fair value the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments derivative investments the company uses derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to limit exposure to changes in interest rates derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income and any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately accounts receivable accounts receivable are comprised of trade receivables and unbilled revenue including clearing and transaction fees and market data and information services revenue all accounts receivable are stated at cost exposure to losses on receivables for clearing and transaction fees and other amounts owed by clearing firms is dependent on each clearing firms financial condition and the memberships that collateralize fees owed to the exchange the exchange retains the right to liquidate exchange memberships to satisfy a clearing firms receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical losses and managements assessment of probable future collections performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions held for clearing firms may be in the form of cash securities or other noncash deposits performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash held by cme and cmece may be invested in us government securities and certain foreign government securities acquired through and held by a brokerdealer subsidiary of a bank reverse

consolidated balance sheetsproperty equipment and leasehold improvements property equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straightline method generally over two to thirtynine years property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the respective lease to which they relate or the remaining useful life of the leasehold improvement land is reported at cost internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software generally two to four years operating leases all leases in which the company is the tenant are accounted for as operating leases landlord allowances are recorded as a reduction to rent expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination the company reviews goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable the company may test goodwill quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves significant judgments inherent in the analysis including estimating the amount of and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value of the reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds fair value impairment is recorded in certain circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value  62table of contentsthe company evaluates the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions including forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for indefinitelived intangible assets in certain circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair valueintangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value business combinations the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method the method requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date the company may use independent valuation services to assist in determining the estimated fair values employee benefit plans the company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its consolidated balance sheets changes in that funded status are recognized in the year of change in other comprehensive income

was determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with that settlement value the resulting discount rate was reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics the basis for determining the expected rate of return on plan assets for the plan is comprised of three components historical returns industry peers and forecasted return the plans total return is expected to equal the composite performance of the security markets over the long term the security markets are represented by the returns on various domestic and international stock bond and commodity indexes these returns are weighted according to the allocation of plan assets to each market and measured individually the overall objective of the plan is to achieve required longterm rates of return in order to meet future benefit payments the component of the investment policy for the plan that has the most significant impact on returns is the asset mix the asset mix has a minimum and maximum range depending on asset class the plan assets are diversified to minimize the risk of large losses by any one or more individual assets such diversification is accomplished in part through the selection of asset mix and investment management the asset allocation for the plan by asset category at december 31 was as follows 2014 2013fixed income298 314us

globex system and unquantified enhanced damages for what the plaintiff alleges is willful infringement of two patents in addition to costs expenses and attorneys fees the case was stayed pending the outcome of cmes request for reexamination by the us patent and trademark office uspto the reexaminations resulted in some claims being rejected and others being confirmed in june 2013 the court lifted the stay the validity of the patents however remains subject to further review by the uspto based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges in 2009 cme and cbot filed a complaint against howard garber in the northern district of illinois seeking a declaratory judgment that neither cme nor cbot infringed the garber patent which relates to electronic market makers and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable the technology research group trg was substituted for

certificate canceling all claims in the garber patent and indicating that the period for appeal has expired as a result the matter is resolvedthe fifth market legal matter involves an alleged infringement of intellectual property which due to its nature involves a potential liability that is uncertain difficult to quantify and involves a wide range of potential outcomes the company believes that the matter is without merit and the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the claim we expect the reexamination by the uspto in the fifth market matter including any appeals thereof to result in a determination of the validity of the patent at issue which we expect will have an impact on the merits of the matter given the uncertainty of factors which may potentially impact the resolution of the matter at this time the company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss in the unlikely event it were found to

defenses to the claim in the normal course of business the company discusses matters with its regulators raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiry and oversight these matters could result in censures fines penalties or other sanctions management believes the outcome of any resulting actions will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations however the company is unable to predict the outcome or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters or the potential fines penalties or injunctive or other equitable relief if any that may result from these matters in addition the company is a defendant in and has potential for various other legal proceedings arising from its regular business activities while the ultimate results of such proceedings against the company cannot be predicted with certainty the company believes that the resolution of any of these matters on an individual basis will not have a

measurements for disclosure purposes level 1 inputs which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value consist of quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level 2 inputs consist of observable market data other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entityspecific inputslevel 1 assets generally include us treasury securities and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices in general the company uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine the fair value of marketable securities and equity investments if quoted prices are not available to determine fair value the company uses other inputs that are directly observable assets and liabilities included in level 2 generally consist of assetbacked securities and interest rate swap contracts assetbacked securities were measured at fair value based on matrix pricing using prices of similar securities with similar inputs such as maturity dates interest rates and credit ratings the company determined the fair value of its interest rate swap contracts using standard valuation models with marketbased observable inputs including forward and spot exchange rates and interest rate curvesthe company determined the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities considered level 3 liabilities using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of future payouts the liabilities were included in level 3 because management used significant unobservable inputs including a discount rate of 20 and payout probabilities ranging from 0 to 100 significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly different fair value financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 and 2013 were classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that was
