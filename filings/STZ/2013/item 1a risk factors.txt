these acquisition activities are the beer business acquisition pursuant to our current amended and restated bridge financing we have committed financing of up to 4375 billionif the beer business acquisition is not completed for any reason the price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the market price of our common stock reflects market assumptions that the acquisition will be completed we cannot guarantee that the beer business acquisition will be completed on the agreed upon terms or at all consummation of that acquisition is subject to the following risks and uncertainties among othersabi and grupo modelo sab de cv modelo and affiliated entities of each of them may not complete their transaction due to lack of receipt of necessary regulatory approval legal challenges by private parties or otherwisealthough our bridge provides committed financing for additional debt to fund most of the purchase price there is no guarantee that the bridge lenders will fulfill their obligations to us or that we will be able to otherwise finance the beer business acquisitiondue to its unique nature if the beer business acquisition does not occur it is unlikely that a comparable transaction can be consummatedin order to complete the beer business acquisition we will incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the futurewe currently expect to finance the beer business acquisition with available cash and proceeds from a combination of debt financings including the issuance of notes additional term loans and revolver borrowings under our senior credit facility and borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to amend our current senior credit facility in order to provide for certain of this additional debt needed to fund the beer business acquisition the incurrence of the additional debt to fund the approximately 475 billion aggregate purchase price for the beer business acquisition may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future we may have to obtain financing under the bridge facility if we cannot secure some or all of the expected permanent financing the interest rates and other financial terms for debt incurred pursuant to the bridge facility would be generally less favorable than what we have contemplated under our present plans for permanent financing arrangements in addition the bridge facility imposes various covenants and restrictions upon us which would apply in the event we obtained financing under itif we fail to realize the expected benefits from the beer business acquisition it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt and our results of operations may fail to meet expectationsif the financial performance of our business as supplemented by the assets and business acquired in the beer business acquisition does not meet our expectations it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations we may not realize the expected benefits of the beer business acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges the success of the beer business acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired assets and business with our existing businesses the integration process may be complex costly and timeconsuming complications with the integration could result from the following circumstances among othersfailure to implement our business plan for the combined businessunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing logistics information communications and other systemsfailure to retain key customers and suppliersunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulationsfailure to retain key employees of crown or the brewery companiesoperating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our businessfailure to expand the brewery under the timeline imposed by the antitrust division of the united states department of justice pursuant to its proposed final judgmentunanticipated issues expenses and liabilities andunfamiliarity with operating in mexico10table of contents we may not be able to achieve the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we expect with respect to our operation of the brewery and our full ownership of crown and other acquired assets in addition we may not accomplish the integration smoothly including the expansion of the brewery successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe if we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and other potential synergies of the beer business acquisition are not realized fully or at all or take longer to realize than expected our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impactedour experience operating breweries is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the beer business acquisitionalthough we have prior experience operating breweries it is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the beer business acquisition in order to operate the brewery we will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are new to our organizationour business will become more dependent on our sales of modelo brands productsfollowing completion of the beer business acquisition sales of the modelo brands in the us will become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the modelo brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition the modelo brands are among the top imported premium beer brands in the us corona extra is the leading imported brand modelo especial is third and corona light is first among imported light beers consequently any material shift in consumer preferences away from the modelo brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the modelo brands or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value such changes in performance and taste could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationswe will become dependent on the brewery for our supply of modelo brands and eventually the brewery is expected to be our sole source of supply for the modelo brandsthe majority of crowns requirements for modelo brands are produced by the brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and our contractual arrangements with abi anticipate that eventually all of crowns supply of the modelo brands will be produced by the brewery we intend to expand the brewerys capacity over the threeyear period following consummation of the beer business acquisition and will enter into interim supply arrangements for a supply of additional modelo brands products for a period of three years following consummation of the beer business acquisition these arrangements will also provide for up to two oneyear extensions however the antitrust division of the united states department of justice will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of these interim supply arrangements beyond three years there can be no assurance that any requested extension would be grantedcrown may not be able to satisfy all its product supply requirements for modelo brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the brewery due to terrorism or other risks such as natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy the facility also if the contemplated expansion of the brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition the brewery may not be able to produce sufficient modelo brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain modelo brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at the brewery even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect the brewery a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses the brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60 of our current projected product requirements11table of contents we face risks associated with the spa

there may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of the brewery companies we will acquire under the spa abi has agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties our sole remedy from abi for any breach of those representations and warranties is an action for indemnification not to exceed 500 million under the spa damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour operation of the brewery will depend on a sufficient supply of quality water and agricultural and other raw materialswe will be dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the brewery the brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the brewerys ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansion there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future if water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available to the brewery water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of the brewery any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsthe brewery also uses a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce its products such as corn starch malt hops and water and packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products the brewery also uses a significant amount of energy in its operations the supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or do not effectively or completely hedge

employees suppliers and customerscompetition could have a material adverse effect on our businesswe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices changes in geographic or product mix a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of our products wholesaler retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by among other things the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products including their quality or pricing compared to competitors products unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing purchasing financing operational advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers state and provincial agencies and retailers which could affect their supply of or consumer demand for our products we could also experience higher than expected selling general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasonsan increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our businessthe us canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the us federal budget and individual state provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products business customers or consumers various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years many us states have considered proposals to increase and some of these states have increased state alcohol excise taxes there may be further consideration by federal state provincial local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate in addition federal state provincial local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing warehousing trade and pricing practices permitted and required labeling advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers certain federal state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationsbenefit cost increases could reduce our profitabilityour profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits in recent years employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the us these 15table of contents factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial conditionwe also sponsor a very limited number of defined benefit plans that cover a limited number of our nonus employees our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as discount rates the rates of return on the plans assets exchange rate fluctuations future governmental regulation global equity prices and our required andor voluntary contributions to the plans without sustained growth in pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans assets and depending upon the other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions we could be required to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit planswe rely on the performance of wholesale distributors major retailers and government agencies for the success of our businesslocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide in the us we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores club and discount stores package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies while in canada we sell our products principally to government agencies in the us we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our us net sales the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionthe industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels particularly in the us if we are unable to successfully adapt to this changing environment our net income market share and volume growth could be negatively affected in addition wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases accordingly wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors in the future our wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional supportour business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sellwhile over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and drivinga general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in onpremise establishments such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcoholconsumer dietary preferences favoring lighter lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks sports drinks and water productsthe increased activity of antialcohol groupsincreased federal state provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing andincreased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products16table of contents we are primarily a branded consumer products company and we rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affected other factors may also reduce consumer spending on our products including economic declines inflation a trend towards frugality even as the economy improves wars pandemics weather and natural or manmade disasters as the cost of gasoline and other petroleumbased products increases consumers may not have as much discretionary funds available to buy our productsin addition our continued success depends in part on our ability to develop new products the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch among other things can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation unsuccessful implementation or shortlived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory writeoffs and other costsvarious diseases pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapes or other agricultural raw materialsvarious diseases pests fungi viruses drought frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs andor reduce production growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supplywe generally purchase raw materials under shortterm supply contracts we are subject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and graperelated materials and we have a limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesour business is heavily dependent upon raw materials such as grapes grape juice concentrate grains alcohol and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers we could experience raw material supply production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us in the past we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectationsthe wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply in a severe oversupply environment the ability of wine producers including ourselves to raise prices is limited and in certain situations the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices further although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environmentglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business17table of contents climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business operations or financial performance and water scarcity or poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacityour business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our agricultural raw materials such as grapes decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain which may affect production operations insurance cost and coverage as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers retailers and consumerswater is essential in the production of our products the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionif we suffer a loss to our wineries production facilities or distribution system or the breweries which produce the beer we sell due to catastrophe our business operations or financial performance could be seriously harmedthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations two of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca and the mission bell winery in madera ca these two facilities produce approximately 27 million cases or 42 of our product annually much of our supply of mexican beer is produced at the brewery in piedras negras coahuila mexico additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial lossour operations subject us to risks relating to doing business globally currency rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businessin addition to our operations in the us we have operations in canada new zealand and italy our products are produced in various countries around the world and we sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world and we have announced plans to enter into certain emerging markets over time upon consummation of the pending beer business acquisition we will also have operations in mexico therefore we are subject to risks associated with potential disruptions caused by changes in political economic and social environments including civil and political unrest terrorism local labor conditions and changes in laws governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the us we are also subject to us laws affecting the activities of us companies abroad including tax laws anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights our success will 18table of contents depend in part on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting us companies with global operations although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations including anticorruption laws there can be no assurance that our employees business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable us or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties interruptions of business terminations of necessary licenses and permits and other legal and equitable sanctions we are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks we could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes these currency economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition especially to the extent these matters or the decisions policies or economic strength of our suppliers affect our global operations we have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and if we are required to writedown any of these intangible assets it could materially reduce our net incomefor the years ended

financial condition or results of operations this risk should be eliminated if the beer business acquisition is consummatedclass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse the misuse of alcohol product liability or marketing or sales practices could adversely affect our businessthere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol including drinking and driving underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol we also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that results from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business19table of contents any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operationmaintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers and we also audit our suppliers compliance with our standards it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements if any of our products becomes unfit for consumption is misbranded or causes injury we may have to engage in a product recall andor be subject to liability and incur additional costs a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity our reputation could be impacted negatively by public

consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands20table of contents an increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affect our profitabilitywe have experienced increases in energy costs and energy costs could continue to rise which would result in higher transportation freight and other operating costs we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance including fees licenses and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases we cannot guarantee
