predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer the allowance for doubtful accounts was 19 million and 15 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelyfair value of financial instruments the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available when quoted market prices are not available the company uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments such as forwards options swaps etc which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows see note 5derivative instruments as a multinational company the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates diesel fuel prices and interest rates that could affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the amount of volatility realized will vary based upon the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding during a particular period of time as well as the currency fuel pricing and interest rate market movements during that same period66table of contents the company enters into derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps foreign currency forward and option contracts and diesel fuel swaps to manage interest rate foreign currency and diesel fuel pricing risks respectively in accordance with the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value see note 4 note 5 the fair values of the companys derivative instruments change with fluctuations in interest rates currency rates andor fuel prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures the companys derivative instruments are held solely to hedge economic exposures the company follows strict policies to manage interest rate foreign currency and diesel fuel pricing risks including prohibitions on derivative marketmaking or other speculative activitiesto qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement including the risk management objective hedging strategy hedged item specific risk that is being hedged the derivative instrument how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured the derivative must be highly effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows as appropriate of the risk being hedged effectiveness is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative measurescertain of the companys derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging for others the company chooses not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment these undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge the companys exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency investments primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to repatriation of those loans or investments foreign currency contracts generally less than 12 months in duration are used to hedge some of these risks the companys derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives when the derivative instrument is settled within the fiscal quarter or offsets a recognized balance sheet exposure in these circumstances the mark to fair value is reported currently through earnings in selling general and administrative expenses on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 the company had undesignated foreign currency contracts outstanding with a notional value of 3551 million and 1486 million respectively in addition the company had offsetting undesignated interest rate swap agreements with an absolute notional amount of 10 billion outstanding as of february 28 2013 see note 10 the company had no undesignated interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of february 29 2012furthermore when the company determines that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively the company also discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when i a derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriatecash flow hedgesthe company is exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases and historically third party financing arrangements the company primarily uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain of these risks in addition the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and diesel fuel swaps to manage its exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices derivatives managing the companys cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less with a maximum maturity of five years throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed all components of the companys derivative instruments gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in the event the relationship is no longer effective the company recognizes the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in conjunction with its effectiveness testing the company also evaluates ineffectiveness associated with the hedge relationship resulting ineffectiveness if any is recognized immediately on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in selling general and administrative expenses67table of contents the company records the fair value of its foreign currency contracts interest rate swap contracts and diesel fuel swap contracts qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting treatment on its consolidated balance sheets with the effective portion of the related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders equity as a component of aoci these deferred gains or losses are recognized on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the same period in which the underlying hedged items are recognized and on the same line item as the underlying hedged items however to the extent that any derivative instrument is not considered to be highly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item the hedging relationship is terminated and the amount related to the ineffective portion of such derivative instrument is immediately recognized on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in selling general and administrative expensesas of february

value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test would be unnecessary if an entity concludes otherwise the entity would be required to complete

a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the fair value measurement guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly and level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liabilitythe following table presents the
