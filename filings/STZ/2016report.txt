in total we intend to expand the nava brewerys capacity to 275 million hectoliters with the subsequent nava brewery expansions from 20 million hectoliters to 275 million hectoliters targeted to be completed by early calendar 2018to meet our beer supply requirements above the current nava brewery capacity we entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with anheuserbusch inbev sanv abi in june 2013 this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting through the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj has a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three yearswhile we remain on track with the nava brewery expansion activity we have extended the interim supply agreement through june 2017 in order to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacityadditionally the initial construction of the mexicali brewery to provide 10 million hectoliters of production capacity is targeted to be completed by calendar yearend 2020 with the first 5 million hectoliters targeted to be completed by calendar yearend 2019we currently operate four facilities in the greater san diego california area that produce our ballast point brand including miramar which serves as

principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate eight wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy and in march through may in new zealand6table of contentsour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our craft and mexican beer brands include water agricultural products such as malt hops yeast and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboardfor our mexican beer brands packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2016 the package format mix of our mexican beer volume sold in the us was 74 glass bottles 24 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe nava brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the nava brewerys ongoing and future requirements after completing the nava brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of materials needed to produce and package beer for varying periods up to 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and independent supply arrangements for the beer business operations have essentially been completedas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has one operational glass furnace and the joint venture intends to scale it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018 when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 50 of our glass requirements for the nava brewery we also entered into longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producers during fiscal 2015the principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 960 independent growers in the us and approximately 220 independent growers located primarily in canada and new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 29 2016 we owned or leased approximately 21700 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time7table of contentswe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a range of laws and

beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category as a result in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases our beer sales are typically

tightening of credit and capital markets unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations unemployment tax increases governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products these could also create or exacerbate credit issues cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers distributors retailers and consumers the inability of suppliers distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund those funds would not be available to usglobal

contentsinadequate levels of compliance with applicable antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andother challenges caused by distance language and cultural differencesour success will depend in part on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting us companies with global operations although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations including anticorruption laws there can be no assurance that our employees business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable us or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties interruptions of business terminations of necessary licenses and permits and other legal and equitable sanctionswe are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations unstable governments unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes these currency economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition especially to the extent these matters or the decisions policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors affect our global operationscompetitionwe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors includingour inability to maintain or increase pricesnew entrants in our market or categoriesa general decline in beverage alcohol consumption orthe decision of wholesalers or consumers to purchase a competitors product instead of oursunit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing purchasing financing operational advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers state and provincial agencies and retailers which could affect their supply of or consumer demand for our products we could also experience higher than expected selling general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasonsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssince the beer business acquisition sales of the mexican beer brands in the us have become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our nava brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through june 2017 although we are in the process of 12table of contentsconstructing an additional brewery in mexicali baja california mexico with the first phase targeted for completion in calendar 2019 our nava brewery may for a period of time become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60 of our current product requirements and before the end of calendar 2016 its capacity is expected to increase to allow it to fill approximately 80 of our projected product requirements we are in the process of further expanding the nava brewerys capacity over a threeyear period the first phase which was intended to make us selfsufficient is targeted to be complete in calendar 2016 the second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2017 and the third phase to support additional growth of the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2018 in 2013 we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years the term of this interim supply agreement has been extended for one additional year as to a select number of products to ensure additional supply beyond the initial nava expansion to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity the interim supply agreement will now expire in june 2017 there can be no assurance that any additional requested extension would be grantedour nava brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery the mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility by early calendar 2018 in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated initial expansion of our nava brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition and the additional incremental expansions of the nava brewery and construction of the mexicali brewery to support further growth of our business are not completed by their targeted completion dates we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at our nava brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint ventures mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable lossessupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materials certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fieldswe have substantial wine operations in the state of california which has endured an extended period of drought and has instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries continued or more severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions our nava brewery 13table of contentsand the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansions there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the futureif water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to our breweries our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour breweries the glass plant our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the nava brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt hops yeast and water as well as corn sugars spices and fruits the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water our breweries our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities including the glass plant also use a significant amount of energy in their operations including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities the supply and price of raw materials packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors including supply of goods and energy affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations approximately 80 of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 36 million cases or approximately 70 of our us production which is approximately 55 of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries our lodi distribution center in lodi ca and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may 14table of contentsbe at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial lossexpansion issues construction issues and operational disruptionswe are currently expanding our nava brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owensillinois is expanding the glass plant while these multimillion dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns our supply of mexican beer brands would be negatively impacted if a serious delay in these expansion or construction activities were to occur leading to a negative impact upon our results of operation and financial conditionexpansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatory and developmental risks including but not limited to i our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us ii potential changes in federal state and local statutes and regulations including environmental requirements that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project iii inability to acquire rightsofway or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us and iv inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies including electricity natural gas and diesel fuelmany of our production facilities such as our breweries wineries and distillery and the mexican glass plant held by the joint venture with owensillinois are asset intensive our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges unexpected capital spending or product supply constraintsacquisition divestiture and joint venture strategywe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may from time to time acquire additional businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business recently these have included the meiomi wine brand the ballast point craft beer business and our agreement to acquire the prisoner wine company brand portfolio we may also divest ourselves of businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations our overall internal control over financial reporting processes and our financial operations and information systems if the financial performance of our business as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired does not meet our expectations it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectationswe cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures such as revenue earnings or operating efficiency and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes complications with ongoing integration of any acquisition or joint venture including our beer business acquisition or the acquisition of a mexican glass plant by our joint venture with owensillinois could result from the following circumstances among othersfailure to implement our business plan for the combined businessunanticipated issues in integrating migrating or changing manufacturing logistics information communications financial internal control and other systemsfailure to retain key customers and suppliersunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulationsfailure to retain key employeesoperating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our businessunanticipated issues expenses and liabilitiesfailure to realize fully anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and other potential synergies andunfamiliarity with operating new locations15table of contentsthe integration of the beer business acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstancesmexican brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization our ability to

of our beer business andfailure to expand the nava brewery under the timeline imposed by the doj pursuant to the final judgmentour joint venture with owensillinois to operate a glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility will be utilized to support our mexican beer business and the production at our nava brewery the integration of the mexican glass plant acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstanceswe share control of the joint venture with owensillinois and while owensillinois has deep

the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constantwe have entered into joint ventures such as our mexican glass plant joint venture with owensillinois and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other

interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies similarly in 2016 we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an initial public offering of a portion of our canadian wine business our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us among other matters to pay certain costs to make capital investments to fulfill alone our joint venture partners obligations or to purchase other parties interests even though we share control of our mexican glass plant joint venture the financial results of that joint venture are consolidated into our financial results our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investmentswe cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition divestiture joint venture or investment activities will be accurateindebtednessin recent years we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our

glass plant held through the mexican glass plant joint venture we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements to pay dividends and to fund our general corporate and capital requirementsour ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance we do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions levels of interest rates and financial business and other factorsour current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences these consequences include or may include the followingour ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limitedour funds available for operations expansions dividends or other distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtednessour ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants andour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and thus our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limitedrestrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions incur debt encumber or sell assets pay dividends engage in mergers and consolidations enter into transactions with affiliates make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements it additionally contains certain financial covenants including a net debt coverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless among other things limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into saleleaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assetsthese agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which if triggered may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements we could be in default under such agreements which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain crossacceleration or crossdefault provisionspotential decline in the consumption of products we sellwe rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands including our mexican beer brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affectedwhile over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving17table of contentsa general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in onpremise establishments such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcoholconsumer dietary preferences favoring lighter lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks sports drinks

alcohol advertising and marketingincreased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise taxinflation andwars pandemics weather and natural or manmade disastersin addition our continued success depends in part on our ability to develop new products the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch among other things can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation unsuccessful implementation or shortlived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory writeoffs and other costsreliance on wholesale distributors major retailers and government agencieslocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide within our primary market in the us we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer craft beer branded wine and spirits categories with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolios and our wine and spirits portfolio in the us we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores club and discount stores package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies while in canada we sell our products principally to government agencies in the us we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our us wine and spirits sales the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longerterm sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels particularly in the us if we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment our net income market share and volume growth could be negatively affected in addition wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space promotional support and consumer purchases accordingly wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitorsreliance upon complex information systems and third party global networkswe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build

of our floating libor rate debt interest payments on longterm debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements which represent approximately 06 of our total longterm debt as amounts are not material2 other longterm liabilities include 178 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of february 29 2016 06 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period the payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters other longterm liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of 126 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in addition other longterm liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material for a detailed discussion of these items refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements3 total purchase obligations consist primarily of 54127 million for contracts to

revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investorscapital expendituresduring fiscal 2016 we incurred 8913 million for capital expenditures including 8003 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer expansion projects management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs we plan to spend from 125 billion to 135 billion for capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 including from 115 billion to 125 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer expansion projects the remaining amounts consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment andor buildings in total over the next five fiscal year periods we expect to spend approximately 3 billion for capital expenditures associated with the mexico beer expansion projects upon completion the total spend from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2021 for the mexico beer expansion projects is estimated to approximate 45 billioneffects of inflation and changing pricesour results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices subject to normal 45table of contentscompetitive conditions there can be no assurances however that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices in addition we continue to identify ongoing cost savings initiativescritical accounting estimatesour significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements however certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying those policies management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business our critical accounting estimates includegoodwill and other intangible assets  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the twostep impairment test in the first step the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill our reporting units include the beer segment and us canada new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis of all of our reporting units the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits us reporting unit by approximately 43 in fiscal 2015 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we concluded that there were no indications of 46table of contentsimpairment for any of our reporting units in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 2787 million in connection with the wine and spirits canadian reporting unitthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections as of january 1 2016 if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its estimated fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyour other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2015 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 222 million in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian businessthe most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual revenue projections as of january 1 2016 if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value accounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations 47table of contentsregarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for income taxes  we estimate our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies we are subject to income taxes in canada luxembourg mexico new zealand the us and other jurisdictions we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations if necessary we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized we believe that all tax positions are fully supported however we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates if significant could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting guidance not yet

exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate when we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in aoci and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs when it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur any remaining gain or loss in aoci is recognized immediately in our results of operationswe expect 276 million of net losses net of income tax effect to be reclassified from aoci to our results of operations within the next 12 months68table of contentsundesignated hedges certain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for others we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment these undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency investments primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments and commodity prices primarily consisting of heating oil diesel fuel corn aluminum and natural gas prices foreign currency contracts generally less than 12 months in duration and commodity derivative contracts generally less than 36 months in duration with a maximum maturity of five years are used to hedge some of these risks our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior managementcredit risk we are exposed to creditrelated losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default this credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts to manage this risk we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investmentgrade credit ratings and with whom we have standard international swaps and derivatives association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts we have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored because of these safeguards we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterialin addition our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements as of february 29 2016 the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was 1124 million if we were required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on february 29 2016 we would

fair value measurements for financial instruments this guidance emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability it establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy includes three levelslevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly andlevel 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liabilityfair value methodology and assumptions the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instrumentsforeign currency and commodity derivative contracts  our foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts and our commodity derivative contracts consist of swap contracts the fair value is estimated using marketbased inputs obtained from independent pricing services into valuation models these valuation models require various inputs including contractual terms market foreign exchange prices market commodity prices interestrate yield curves and currency volatilities as applicable level 2 fair value measurement71table of contentsinterest rate swap contracts  the fair value is

reporting unit which when combined with changes in strategy within the canadian business indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit might be below its carrying value these trends included a reduction in market growth rates for certain portions of the domestic canadian wine industry as well as the identification that certain improvement initiatives had not materialized in parts of the canadian business such as refreshments and wine kits in addition imported brands had been experiencing market growth within the canadian market and certain of our noncanadian branded wine products imported into canada provided higher margin to us on a consolidated basis accordingly we modified our strategy to capitalize on this trend and shift focus from certain portions of the domestic business to imported brands the canadian reporting unit realizes only a piece of the overall profit attributable to imported brands whereas it realizes all of the profit attributable to the domestic business therefore we evaluated our goodwill for impairment using the twostep processin the first step the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was compared to its carrying value including goodwill the estimate of fair value was determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows as the estimated 73table of contentsfair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step was performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the estimated fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we considered estimates of future operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit discounted using market based discount rates the estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from updated longterm financial forecasts which were developed as part of the change in strategy for the canadian business the decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment loss was primarily driven by the updated longterm financial forecasts which showed lower estimated future operating results primarily due to the change in strategy for the canadian business the implied fair value of the canadian reporting units goodwill of 1596 million compared to its carrying value of 4339 million resulted in the recognition of an impairment of 2787 milliontrademarksfor the three months ended august 31 2013 prior to the goodwill impairment analysis discussed above we performed a review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment we determined that certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profits associated with the related products included in the updated longterm financial forecasts developed as part of the change in strategy for the canadian business accordingly trademarks with a carrying value of 902 million were written down to their estimated fair value of 683 million resulting in an impairment of 222 millionwe measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values the estimated fair value was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method which assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of trademark assets the cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair values of our trademarks involve several assumptions including i projected revenue growth rates ii estimated royalty rates iii aftertax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks and iv discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademarks8 goodwillthe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows beer wine and spirits consolidatedin millions     balance february 28 201437146
