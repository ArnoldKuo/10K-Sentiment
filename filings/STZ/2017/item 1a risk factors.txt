approximately 10 miles from the california border will initially be built to provide 5 million hectoliters production capacity with the ability to scale to 20 million hectoliters production capacity in the future5table of contentspreviously to meet our beer supply requirements above the original 10 million hectoliter nava brewery production capacity we entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with modelo in june 2013 this agreement was initially extended for one additional year to june 2017 however the purchase of the obregon brewery enabled us to become fully independent from this interim supply agreement which was terminated at the time of this acquisitionwe currently operate five facilities in the greater san diego california area for the production of our ballast point brand including miramar which serves as the primary production site for the brand this facility was built in 2014 and may be expanded to accommodate future growth additionally we are building a ballast point brewery in daleville virginiain the us we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us and italy and in march through may in new zealandour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta we currently operate two facilities in the us for the production of our high west whiskey brand the requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various supplierscertain of our wines and spirits must be aged for more than one year up to multiple years therefore our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businessessources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our craft and mexican beer brands include water agricultural products such as yeast and grains and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboardfor our mexican beer brands packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2017 the package format mix of our mexican beer volume sold in the us was 72 glass bottles 26 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe nava brewery and the obregon brewery receive water originating from aquifers we believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries ongoing requirements as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion and optimization activitiesas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has two operational glass furnaces and the joint venture intends to increase it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018 when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 50 of our glass requirements for the nava brewery we also have longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producersthe principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 950 independent growers in the us and approximately 125 6table of contentsindependent growers located primarily in new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 28 2017 we owned or leased approximately 20900 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present timewe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate where

the disruption volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations unemployment tax increases governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products these could also create or exacerbate credit issues cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers distributors retailers and consumers the inability of suppliers distributors and retailers to

not be available to us11table of contentsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssales of our mexican beer brands in the us are a significant portion of our business accordingly a decline in the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us could adversely affect our business further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our nava brewery located in nava coahuila mexico and our obregon brewery located in obregon sonora mexico although we are in the process of optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing an additional brewery in mexicali baja california mexico our nava brewery and our obregon brewery are currently our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 80 of our current product requirements with the balance able to be filled by our obregon breweryour supply of mexican beer brands is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired and is expanding the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or the obregon brewery also if the contemplated nava brewery and glass plant expansions obregon brewery optimization and mexicali brewery construction activities are not completed by their targeted completion dates we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at our nava brewery or our obregon brewery even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable lossesexpansion issues construction issues and operational disruptionswe are currently expanding our nava brewery optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owensillinois is expanding the glass plant while these multimillion dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overrunsexpansion and optimization of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks including but not limited to i our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us ii potential changes in federal state and local statutes and regulations including environmental requirements that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project iii inability to acquire rightsofway or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us and iv inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel any of these events could delay the expansion construction or optimization of our production facilities12table of contentsmany of our production facilities such as our breweries wineries distilleries and the glass plant are asset intensive our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges unexpected capital spending or product supply constraintssupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materials certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries our wineries and our distilleries as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fieldswe have substantial wine operations in the state of california although certain areas in california have recently experienced flooding the state had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries a recurrence of severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions our nava brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer our obregon brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our mexicali brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated optimization and expansions there is no guarantee that the water available to them our expectations as to the source of water methods of water delivery or their water requirements will not change materially in the futuregrowing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to our breweries our wineries our distilleries and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supply any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour breweries the glass plant our wineries and our distilleries also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the nava brewery and the obregon brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt hops yeast and water as well as corn sugars spices and fruits the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distilleries use large amounts of grain and water our breweries our wineries and our distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities including the glass plant also use a significant amount of energy in their operations including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities the supply and price of raw materials packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors including supply of goods and energy affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted13table of contentsglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us wine and spirits operations and a different supplier supplies our glass bottles for our craft beer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations approximately 80 of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny and the mission bell winery in madera ca these three facilities produce approximately 406 million cases or approximately 75 of our us production which is approximately 60 of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally currently our entire mexican beer brands product supply is produced at our breweries in nava coahuila mexico and obregon sonora mexicoadditionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries our lodi distribution center in lodi ca certain of our ballast point operations and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or
