results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results upon settlement the net gain loss from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting

undistributed earnings than class b convertible common stock in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stocknet income per common share  basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the twoclass method net income per common share  diluted for class a common stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock net income per common share  diluted for class a common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the ifconverted

are designated as cash flow hedges we are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks in addition we utilize interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less with a maximum maturity of five yearsto qualify for hedge accounting treatment the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement including the risk management objective hedging strategy hedged item specific risk that is being hedged the derivative instrument how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured the derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures all components of our derivative instruments gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness resulting ineffectiveness if any is recognized immediately in our results of operationswhen we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively in the event the relationship is no longer effective we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of operations we also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when i a derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate when we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in aoci and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs when it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur any remaining gain or loss in aoci is recognized immediately in our results of operationswe expect 171

instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for others we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment these undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency investments primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments and commodity prices primarily consisting of heating oil diesel fuel aluminum natural gas and corn prices we primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts generally less than 12 months in duration and commodity derivative contracts generally less than 36 months in duration with a maximum maturity of five years to hedge some of these risks our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior managementcredit risk we are exposed to creditrelated losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default this credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts to manage this risk we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investmentgrade credit ratings and with whom we have standard international swaps and derivatives association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts we have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored because of these safeguards we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterialin addition our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements as of february 28 2017 the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in

requires disclosures about fair value measurements for financial instruments this guidance emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability it establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy includes three levelslevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly andlevel 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liabilityfair value methodology and assumptions the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instrumentsforeign currency and commodity derivative contracts  our foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts and our commodity derivative contracts consist of swap contracts the fair value is estimated using marketbased inputs obtained from independent pricing services into valuation models these valuation models require various inputs including contractual terms market foreign exchange prices market commodity prices interestrate yield curves and currency volatilities as applicable level 2 fair value measurementinterest rate swap contracts  the fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interestrate yield curves

trademarks were associated with certain us brands within our wine and spirits portfolio sold exclusively through the canadian wine business for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiturewe measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values the estimated fair value was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method which assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of trademark assets the cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair values of our trademarks involve several assumptions including i projected revenue growth rates ii estimated royalty rates iii aftertax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks and iv discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademarks8 goodwillthe changes

issued guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers under this guidance an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services a five step process will be utilized to recognize revenue as follows i identify the contract with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation additionally this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we are required to adopt this guidance for our annual and interim periods beginning march 1 2018 utilizing one of two methods retrospective restatement for each reporting period presented at time of adoption or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying this guidance recognized at the date of initial applicationwe intend to implement this guidance under the retrospective approach based on our preliminary review we expect that the broad definition of variable consideration under this guidance will require us to estimate and record certain variable payments resulting from various sales incentives earlier than we currently record them we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we are currently preparing to implement changes to our accounting policies systems and controls to support the new revenue recognition and disclosure requirements103table of contentsleases in february 2016 the fasb issued guidance for the accounting for leases under this guidance a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for most leases but will recognize expense similar to current lease accounting guidance for leases with a term of 12 months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities we are required to adopt this guidance for our annual and interim periods beginning march 1 2019 using a modified retrospective approach we are currently assessing the financial impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statementsstock compensation in march 2016 the fasb issued guidance which amends among other items the accounting for income taxes related to sharebased compensation and the related classification in the statement of cash flows this guidance requires the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from an increase or decrease in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or settlement date in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur through february 28 2017 these amounts were recognized in additional paidin capital at the time of vesting or settlement in addition these amounts will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity where they are currently recorded this guidance will also impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method as excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from sharebased compensation are no longer included in the assumed proceeds calculationfor the years ended february 28 2017 february 29 2016 and february 28 2015 we recognized excess tax benefits of 1314 million 2034 million and 780 million respectively in additional paidin capital these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of the amended standard as any excess tax benefits recognized will be dependent upon future stock prices employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates we adopted this guidance on march 1 2017 on a prospective basis22 selected quarterly financial information unauditeda summary of selected quarterly financial information is as
