hectoliters production capacity additionally the construction of the mexicali brewery which will also be located in mexico approximately 10 miles from the california border will initially be built to provide 5 million hectoliters production capacity with the ability to scale to 20 million hectoliters production capacity in the future5table of contentspreviously to meet our beer supply requirements above the original 10 million hectoliter nava brewery production capacity we entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with modelo in june 2013 this agreement was initially extended for one additional year to june 2017 however the purchase of the obregon brewery enabled us to become fully independent from this interim supply agreement which was terminated at the time of this acquisitionwe currently operate five facilities in the greater san diego california area for the production of our ballast point brand including miramar which serves as the primary production site for the brand this facility was built in 2014 and may be expanded to accommodate future growth additionally we are building a ballast point brewery in daleville virginiain the us we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us and italy and in march through may in new zealandour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta we currently operate two facilities in the us for the production of our high west whiskey brand the requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various supplierscertain of our wines and spirits must be aged for more than one year up to multiple years therefore our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businessessources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our craft and mexican beer brands include water agricultural products such as yeast and grains and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboardfor our mexican beer brands packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2017 the package format mix of our mexican beer volume sold in the us was 72 glass bottles 26 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe nava brewery and the obregon brewery receive water originating from aquifers we believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries ongoing requirements as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion and optimization activitiesas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has two operational glass furnaces and the joint venture intends to increase it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018 when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 50 of our glass requirements for the nava brewery we also have longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producersthe principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 950 independent growers in the us and approximately 125 6table of contentsindependent growers located primarily in new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 28 2017 we owned or leased approximately 20900 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present timewe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be

presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periodsinternational operations currency rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertaintyour products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world we have employees in various countries throughout the world and we have production facilities currently in the us mexico new zealand italy and canadarisks associated with international operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations includechanges in local political economic social and labor conditionspotential disruption

governmental regulations and policies in the us and in many countries outside the us including changes in tax laws and regulationsimport and export requirementscurrency exchange rate fluctuationsa less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issueslaws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights10table of contentsinadequate levels of compliance with applicable antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andother challenges caused by distance language and cultural differencesour success will depend in part on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting us companies with international operations although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations including anticorruption and privacy laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable us or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties interruptions of business terminations of necessary licenses and permits and other legal and equitable sanctionswe are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations unstable governments unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes these currency economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition especially to the extent these matters or the decisions policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors affect our international operationscompetitionwe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors includingour inability to maintain or increase prices particularly in our beer businessnew entrants in our market or categoriesa general decline in beverage alcohol consumption orthe decision of wholesalers retailers or consumers to purchase a competitors product instead of oursunit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing purchasing financing operational advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers state and provincial agencies and retailers which could affect their supply of or consumer demand for our products we could also experience higher than expected selling general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasonsworldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditionswe are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions including economic slowdown inflation and the disruption volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations unemployment tax increases governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products these could also create or exacerbate credit issues cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers distributors retailers and consumers the inability of suppliers distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund those funds would not be available to us11table of contentsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssales of our mexican beer brands in the us are a significant portion of our business accordingly a decline in the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us could adversely affect our business further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our nava brewery located in nava coahuila mexico and our obregon brewery located in obregon sonora mexico although we are in the process of optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing an additional brewery in mexicali baja california mexico our nava brewery and our obregon brewery are currently our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 80 of our current product requirements with the balance able to be filled by our obregon breweryour supply of mexican beer brands is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired and is expanding the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or the obregon brewery also if the contemplated nava brewery and glass plant expansions obregon brewery optimization and mexicali brewery construction activities are not completed by their targeted completion dates we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at our nava brewery or our obregon brewery even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable lossesexpansion issues construction issues and operational disruptionswe are currently expanding our nava brewery optimizing our obregon brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owensillinois is expanding the glass plant while these multimillion dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overrunsexpansion and optimization of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks including but not limited to i our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us ii potential changes in federal state and local statutes and regulations including environmental requirements that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project iii inability to acquire rightsofway or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us and iv inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel any of these events could delay the expansion construction or optimization of our production facilities12table of contentsmany of our production facilities such as our breweries wineries distilleries and the glass plant are asset intensive our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges unexpected capital spending or product supply constraintssupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materials certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries our wineries and our distilleries as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fieldswe have substantial wine operations in the state of california although certain areas in california have recently experienced flooding the state had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries a recurrence of severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions our nava brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer our obregon brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our mexicali brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated optimization and expansions there is no guarantee that the water available to them our expectations as to the source of water methods of water delivery or their water requirements will not change materially in the futuregrowing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to our breweries our wineries our distilleries and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supply any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour breweries the glass plant our wineries and our distilleries also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the nava brewery and the obregon brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt hops yeast and water as well as corn sugars spices and fruits the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distilleries use large amounts of grain and water our breweries our wineries and our distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities including the glass plant also use a significant amount of energy in their operations including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities the supply and price of raw materials packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors including supply of goods and energy affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted13table of contentsglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us wine and spirits operations and a different supplier supplies our glass bottles for our craft beer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations approximately 80 of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny and the mission bell winery in madera ca these three facilities produce approximately 406 million cases or approximately 75 of our us production which is approximately 60 of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally currently our entire mexican beer brands product supply is produced at our breweries in nava coahuila mexico and obregon sonora mexicoadditionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries our lodi distribution center in lodi ca certain of our ballast point operations and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial losschanges to international trade agreements and tariffs changes to accounting standards elections or assertions changes to tax laws changes to import and excise duties or other taxes or other governmental rules and regulations including significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations in the marketing or sale of our products and accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputesthe us and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties tariffs and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the us federal budget and individual state provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products business customers or consumers various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years many us states have considered proposals to increase and some of these states have increased state alcohol excise taxes there may be further consideration by federal state provincial local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climatecomments made during the course of the 2016 us presidential campaign and subsequent to the election indicate that the us federal government may propose changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations the current us administration has indicated that tax reform is among its top priorities and the us congress is reviewing and may in the future review tax legislation proposals while we 14table of contentscannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items such changes could affect our business and results of operationsin addition federal state provincial local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing warehousing trade and pricing practices permitted and required labeling advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers certain federal state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects if these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations they may inhibit sales of such productswe may also make various accounting elections or assertions or change accounting elections or assertions that we have previously made our accounting elections or assertions or changes to our accounting elections or assertions are affected by various business factors which collectively may have an impact on our financial results or our effective tax rateadditionally significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards fluctuations in federal state local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results when tax matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on our operating results any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolutionindebtednessin recent years we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our acquisition of ballast point the prisoner wine company brand portfolio the charles smith wines collection high west and the obregon brewery fund the beer business acquisition expand our nava brewery and begin construction of our mexicali brewery expand the glass plant and repurchase shares of our common stock in the future we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes including the nava brewery and glass plant expansions obregon brewery optimization and mexicali brewery construction we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements to pay dividends to repurchase shares of our common stock and to fund our general corporate and capital requirementsour ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance we do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions levels of interest rates and financial business and other factorsour current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences these consequences include or may include the followingour ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limitedour funds available for operations expansions dividends or other distributions or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtednessour ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants andour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and thus our ability to withstand competitive

debt under other agreements that may contain crossacceleration or crossdefault provisionspotential decline in the consumption of products we sellwe rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands including our mexican beer brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affectedwhile over the past several years there have been modest increases in the overall consumption of beverage alcohol and fluctuations in per capita consumption within categories of beverage alcohol there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and drivinga general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in onpremise establishments such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohola decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products as a result of consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of our productsconsumer dietary preferences favoring lighter lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks sports drinks and water productsthe increased activity of antialcohol groupsincreased federal

purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffsinflation andwars pandemics weather and natural or manmade disastersin addition our continued success depends in part on our ability to develop new products the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch among other things can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation unsuccessful implementation or shortlived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory writeoffs and other costs16table of contentsacquisition divestiture and joint venture strategywe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may from time to time acquire additional businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business recently these have included the meiomi wine brand the ballast point craft beer business the prisoner wine company brand portfolio the charles smith wines collection high west and the obregon brewery as well as various minority investments by our constellation ventures function we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations our overall internal control over financial reporting processes and our financial operations and information systems if the financial performance of our business as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired does not meet our expectations it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations we may also divest ourselves of businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business for example we

much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters severe weather events such as drought or flooding in california or a prolonged cold winter in new york and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain which may affect production operations insurance cost and coverage as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers retailers and consumersvarious diseases pests and certain weather conditionsvarious diseases pests fungi viruses drought frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley hops grapes and other agricultural raw materials available decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability we

preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs andor reduce production of grapes or other cropscost of energy or environmental regulatory compliancewe have experienced increases in energy costs in the past and energy costs could rise in the future which would result in higher transportation freight and other operating costs we may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance including fees licenses and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements our future operating

lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses including a change in our assertion regarding indefinitely reinvesting earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and the tax effects of the canadian divestiture for fiscal 2016 our effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesseswe have historically provided deferred income taxes for the repatriation to the us of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 in connection with the agreement to divest the canadian wine business and the ongoing beer capacity expansion activities in mexico including the agreement to acquire the obregon brewery we changed our

prices employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates our current range for next years effective tax rate includes an estimated 3 benefit related to the adoption of this guidance since this new

refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statementsoffbalance sheet arrangementswe do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investorscapital expendituresduring fiscal 2017 we incurred 9074 million for capital expenditures including 7592 million for the beer segment primarily for the mexico beer expansion projects management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs we plan to spend from 12 billion to 13 billion for capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 including from 10 billion to 11 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the mexico beer expansion projects the remaining fiscal 2018 capital expenditures consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment andor buildings we expect to spend the remaining amounts under the previously announced mexico beer expansion projects primarily during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 upon completion the total spend from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2021 for the mexico beer expansion projects is estimated to approximate 39 billioneffects of inflation and changing pricesour results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices subject to normal 46table of contentscompetitive conditions there can be no assurances however that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices in addition we continue to identify ongoing cost savings initiativescritical accounting estimatesour significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements however certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying those policies management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business our critical accounting estimates includegoodwill and other intangible assets  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the twostep impairment test in the first step the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill our reporting units include the beer segment and us new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis of all of our reporting units the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits us reporting unit with approximately 81 excess fair value in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units47table of contentsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections as of january 1 2017 if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its estimated fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyour other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the wine and spirits us business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 376 million in connection with our decision to discontinue certain smallscale lowmargin us brands additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the wine and spirits us business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 84 million in connection with certain us brands sold exclusively through the canadian wine business for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the canadian divestiture no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual revenue projections as of january 1 2017 if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value accounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment 48table of contentspatterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for income taxes  we estimate our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies we are subject to income taxes in canada luxembourg mexico new zealand the us and other jurisdictions we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations if necessary we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized we believe that all tax positions are fully supported however we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates
