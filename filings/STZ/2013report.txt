following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periodsworldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performancealthough we believe the adverse worldwide and domestic economic conditions experienced over recent years are improving the degree and pace of recovery is uncertain and is expected to vary around the globe worldwide and domestic economies remain subject to prolongation exacerbation and expansion of adverse conditions in addition instability in global credit markets including the uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries in the european union the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions we are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions including economic slowdown inflation and the disruption volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets additionally changes in economic and financial conditions in the united states us and other countries including the outcome of negotiations surrounding the us sequester tax increases and potential spending cuts may impact consumer confidence and consumer spendingin addition unfavorable global or domestic economic situations could adversely impact our major suppliers distributors and retailers the inability of suppliers distributors or retailers to conduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund those funds would not be available to usthe timing and nature of any recovery in the financial markets continues to remain uncertain and there can be no assurance that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future a prolonged downturn worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies or return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products and create or exacerbate credit issues cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers distributors retailers and consumers depending upon their severity and duration these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations we are not able to predict the pace of recovery of the economies in the us and our other major markets outside the us nor are we able to predict the outcome of negotiations surrounding the us sequesterany failure to complete the pending beer business acquisition could materially adversely impact the market price of our common stockon june 28 2012 we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement the mipa with anheuserbusch inbev sanv abi under which we agreed that through our subsidiaries we would acquire the remaining 50 of crown imports for a purchase price of approximately 185 billion in addition on june 28 2012 we entered into an interim loan agreement the bridge to provide for fully committed bridge financing in order to complete the acquisition the bridge provided for aggregate credit facilities of 1875 billion on february 13 2013 we amended and restated the mipa entered into a share purchase agreement the spa and amended and restated the bridge and on april 19 2013 we further amended the mipa and amended the spa as a result of these activities we have agreed to acquire i the remaining 50 of crown imports for a purchase price of approximately 185 billion and ii the stock of a company that holds the piedras negras brewery located in nava coahuila mexico the brewery together with the stock of the company which provides workers for the brewery together the brewery companies and will be granted perpetual brand licenses for the mexican portfolio of crown imports currently sold in the us and certain extensions for approximately 29 billion subject to certain 9table of contents closing adjustments collectively these acquisition activities are the beer business acquisition pursuant to our current amended and restated bridge financing we have committed financing of up to 4375 billionif the beer business acquisition is not completed for any reason the price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the market price of our common stock reflects market assumptions that the acquisition will be completed we cannot guarantee that the beer business acquisition will be completed on the agreed upon terms or at all consummation of that acquisition is subject to the following risks and uncertainties among othersabi and grupo modelo sab de cv modelo and affiliated entities of each of them may not complete their transaction due to lack of receipt of necessary regulatory approval legal challenges by private parties or otherwisealthough our bridge provides committed financing for additional debt to fund most of the purchase price there is no guarantee that the bridge lenders will fulfill their obligations to us or that we will be able to otherwise finance the beer business acquisitiondue to its unique nature if the beer business acquisition does not occur it is unlikely that a comparable transaction can be consummatedin order to complete the beer business acquisition we will incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the futurewe currently expect to finance the beer business acquisition with available cash and proceeds from a combination of debt financings including the issuance of notes additional term loans and revolver borrowings under our senior credit facility and borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to amend our current senior credit facility in order to provide for certain of this additional debt needed to fund the beer business acquisition the incurrence of the additional debt to fund the approximately 475 billion aggregate purchase price for the beer business acquisition may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future we may have to obtain financing under the bridge facility if we cannot secure some or all of the expected permanent financing the interest rates and other financial terms for debt incurred pursuant to the bridge facility would be generally less favorable than what we have contemplated under our present plans for permanent financing arrangements in addition the bridge facility imposes various covenants and restrictions upon us which would apply in the event we obtained financing under itif we fail to realize the expected benefits from the beer business acquisition it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt and our results of operations may fail to meet expectationsif the financial performance of our business as supplemented by the assets and business acquired in the beer business acquisition does not meet our expectations it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations we may not realize the expected benefits of the beer business acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges the success of the beer business acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired assets and business with our existing businesses the integration process may be complex costly and timeconsuming complications with the integration could result from the following circumstances among othersfailure to implement our business plan for the combined businessunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing logistics information communications and other systemsfailure to retain key customers and suppliersunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulationsfailure to retain key employees of crown or the brewery companiesoperating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our businessfailure to expand the brewery under the timeline imposed by the antitrust division of the united states department of justice pursuant to its proposed final judgmentunanticipated issues expenses and liabilities andunfamiliarity with operating in mexico10table of contents we may not be able to achieve the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we expect with respect to our operation of the brewery and our full ownership of crown and other acquired assets in addition we may not accomplish the integration smoothly including the expansion of the brewery successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe if we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the anticipated cost savings growth opportunities and other potential synergies of the beer business acquisition are not realized fully or at all or take longer to realize than expected our business financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impactedour experience operating breweries is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the beer business acquisitionalthough we have prior experience operating breweries it is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the beer business acquisition in order to operate the brewery we will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are new to our organizationour business will become more dependent on our sales of modelo brands productsfollowing completion of the beer business acquisition sales of the modelo brands in the us will become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the modelo brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition the modelo brands are among the top imported premium beer brands in the us corona extra is the leading imported brand modelo especial is third and corona light is first among imported light beers consequently any material shift in consumer preferences away from the modelo brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the modelo brands or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value such changes in performance and taste could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationswe will become dependent on the brewery for our supply of modelo brands and eventually the brewery is expected to be our sole source of supply for the modelo brandsthe majority of crowns requirements for modelo brands are produced by the brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and our contractual arrangements with abi anticipate that eventually all of crowns supply of the modelo brands will be produced by the brewery we intend to expand the brewerys capacity over the threeyear period following consummation of the beer business acquisition and will enter into interim supply arrangements for a supply of additional modelo brands products for a period of three years following consummation of the beer business acquisition these arrangements will also provide for up to two oneyear extensions however the antitrust division of the united states department of justice will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of these interim supply arrangements beyond three years there can be no assurance that any requested extension would be grantedcrown may not be able to satisfy all its product supply requirements for modelo brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the brewery due to terrorism or other risks such as natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy the facility also if the contemplated expansion of the brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition the brewery may not be able to produce sufficient modelo brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain modelo brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at the brewery even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect the brewery a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses the brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60 of our current projected product requirements11table of contents we face risks associated with the spa in connection with the beer business acquisitionin connection with the beer business acquisition the companies we acquire may have liabilities that are not satisfied on or prior to the closing date there may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of the brewery companies we will acquire under the spa abi has agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties our sole remedy from abi for any breach of those representations and warranties is an action for indemnification not to exceed 500 million under the spa damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour operation of the brewery will depend on a sufficient supply of quality water and agricultural and other raw materialswe will be dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the brewery the brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the brewerys ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansion there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future if water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available to the brewery water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of the brewery any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsthe brewery also uses a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce its products such as corn starch malt hops and water and packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products the brewery also uses a significant amount of energy in its operations the supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedexpanding our operations into mexico increases risks associated with international operationswe have limited operating experience in mexico completion of the beer business acquisition will generally increase the potential risks and uncertainties associated with our doing business globally including risks relating to currency rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operation of crown and the brewery our operations in mexico will expose us to additional risks associated with international operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations includingchanges in local political economic social and labor conditionspotential disruption from socioeconomic violence including drugrelated violencerestrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the usimport and export requirementscurrency exchange rate fluctuationsa less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues compliance with applicable antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andother challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences12table of contents other risks and uncertainties which we currently face will be increased by the beer business acquisitionupon completion of the beer business acquisition some of the other risks and uncertainties we already face and which are described more fully elsewhere in this section will be increased such as risks and uncertainties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations relating tothe possibility of increases in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulationsthe possibility that benefit cost increases could occur and reduce our profitabilitythe possibility that various diseases pests and certain weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of agricultural raw materials used in production of our productsour purchase of raw materials under shortterm supply contractsthe amount of our

indebtedness to finance further acquisitions additional repurchases of shares of our stock and other general corporate purposes our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance we do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions levels of interest rates and financial business and other factors we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our general corporate capital requirementsour current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences to you these consequences include or may include the followingour ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limitedour funds available for operations expansion or distributions will be reduced because we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtednessour ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants andour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and thus our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited13table of contents

ability to make acquisitions incur debt create liens sell assets pay dividends engage in mergers and consolidations enter into transactions with affiliates make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements it additionally contains certain financial covenants including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than our senior credit facility but nevertheless among other things limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into saleleaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assetsthese agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which if triggered may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt if we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements we could be in default under such agreements which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain crossacceleration or crossdefault provisionsour acquisition divestiture and joint venture strategies may not be successfulwe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures we anticipate that we may from time to time acquire additional businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business and that we may divest ourselves of businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations our overall internal control over financial reporting processes and our financial operations and information systems we cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or realize anticipated operational synergies integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations or separating from our existing operations the operations and personnel of businesses of which we divest may result in difficulties significant expense and accounting charges disrupt our business or divert managements time and attentionwe expect to acquire the remaining 50 interest in crown imports and 100 of the interest in the brewery companies and we recently acquired the remaining 501 interest in ruffino srl and sold 801 of our australian and uk business in connection with the integration of acquired operations the separation of divested businesses or the conduct of our overall business strategies we may periodically restructure our

and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates we may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business additionally our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constantacquisitions involve numerous other risks including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business in connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the us we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments this would subject us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contractswe have also acquired or retained equity or membership interests in companies which we do not control such as our retained less than 20 interest in certain companies that comprised our australian and uk business the other parties that hold the remaining equity or membership interests in these types of companies may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of those companies the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our equity or membership interests may require us among other matters to pay certain costs or to purchase other parties interests our failure to adequately 14table of contents manage the risks associated with any acquisition or the failure of an entity in

activities will be accurate in particular risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures include among others the joint ventures ability to operate its business successfully the joint ventures ability to develop appropriate standards controls procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture and the strength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees suppliers and customerscompetition could have a material adverse effect on our businesswe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices changes in geographic or product mix a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of our products wholesaler retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by among other things the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products including their quality or pricing compared to competitors products unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing purchasing financing operational advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers state and provincial agencies and retailers which could affect their supply of or consumer demand for our products we could also experience higher than expected selling general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasonsan increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our businessthe us canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the us federal budget and individual state provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products business customers or consumers various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years many us states have considered proposals to increase and some of these states have increased state alcohol excise taxes there may be further consideration by federal state provincial local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate in addition federal state provincial local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing warehousing trade and pricing practices permitted and required labeling advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers certain federal state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationsbenefit cost increases could reduce our profitabilityour profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits in recent years employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the us these 15table of contents factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial conditionwe also sponsor a very limited number of defined benefit plans that cover a limited number of our nonus employees our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors such as discount rates the rates of return on the plans assets exchange rate fluctuations future governmental regulation global equity prices and our required andor voluntary contributions to the plans without sustained growth in pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans assets and depending upon the other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions we could be required to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit planswe rely on the performance of wholesale distributors major retailers and government agencies for the success of our businesslocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide in the us we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores club and discount stores package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies while in canada we sell our products principally to government agencies in the us we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our us net sales the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionthe industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels particularly in the us if we are unable to successfully adapt to this changing environment our net income market share and volume growth could be negatively affected in addition wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases accordingly wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors in the future our wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional supportour business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sellwhile over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and drivinga general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in onpremise establishments such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcoholconsumer dietary preferences favoring lighter lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks sports drinks and water productsthe increased activity of antialcohol groupsincreased federal state provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing andincreased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products16table of contents we are primarily a branded consumer products company and we rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affected other factors may also reduce consumer spending on our products including economic declines inflation a trend towards frugality even as the economy improves wars pandemics weather and natural or manmade disasters as the cost of gasoline and other petroleumbased products increases consumers may not have as much discretionary funds available to buy our productsin addition our continued success depends in part on our ability to develop new products the launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch among other things can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation unsuccessful implementation or shortlived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory writeoffs and other costsvarious diseases pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapes or other agricultural raw materialsvarious diseases pests fungi viruses drought frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs andor reduce production growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supplywe generally purchase raw materials under shortterm supply contracts we are subject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and graperelated materials and we have a limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesour business is heavily dependent upon raw materials such as grapes grape juice concentrate grains alcohol and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers we could experience raw material supply production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us in the past we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectationsthe wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply in a severe oversupply environment the ability of wine producers including ourselves to raise prices is limited and in certain situations the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices further although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environmentglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business17table of contents climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business operations or financial performance and water scarcity or poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacityour business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our agricultural raw materials such as grapes decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain which may affect production operations insurance cost and coverage as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers retailers and consumerswater is essential in the production of our products the quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionif we suffer a loss to our wineries production facilities or distribution system or the breweries which produce the beer we sell due to catastrophe our business operations or financial performance could be seriously harmedthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations two of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca and the mission bell winery in madera ca these two facilities produce approximately 27 million cases or 42 of our product annually much of our supply of mexican beer is produced at the brewery in piedras negras coahuila mexico additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial lossour operations subject us to risks relating to doing business globally currency rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businessin addition to our operations in the us we have operations in canada new zealand and italy our products are produced in various countries around the world and we sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world and we have announced plans to enter into certain emerging markets over time upon consummation of the pending beer business acquisition we will also have operations in mexico therefore we are subject to risks associated with potential disruptions caused by changes in political economic and social environments including civil and political unrest terrorism local labor conditions and changes in laws governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the us we are also subject to us laws affecting the activities of us companies abroad including tax laws anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights our success will 18table of contents depend in part on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting us companies with global operations although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations including anticorruption laws there can be no assurance that our employees business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable us or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties interruptions of business terminations of necessary licenses and permits and other legal and equitable sanctions we are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue

effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was 167 and 15 respectively the companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 reflects decreases in uncertain tax positions of 852 million and other tax adjustments of 425 million in connection with the completion of various income tax examinations during fiscal 2012 and a change in the method of filing certain state income tax returns the companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was driven largely by a benefit of 2070 million associated with the deduction for investments and loans related to the cwae divestiture and a decrease in uncertain tax positions of 360 million in connection with the completion of various income tax examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitation during fiscal 2011 partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances against net operating losses in the uk and australianet incomeas a result of the above factors net income decreased to 4450 million for fiscal 2012 from 5595

relied on shortterm borrowings in the us canada and italy the annual grape crush normally begins in august and runs through october in new zealand the annual grape crush normally begins in february and runs through may the company generally begins taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with the majority of payments for such grapes coming due within 90 days the companys shortterm borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended historically the company has used cash flow from operating activities to repay its shortterm borrowings and fund capital expenditures the company will continue to use its shortterm borrowings including its accounts receivable securitization facility to support its working capital requirementsthe company has maintained adequate liquidity to meet current working capital requirements fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest

associated with the required brewery expansion in connection with the pending beer business acquisitioneffects of inflation and changing pricesthe companys results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices the company intends to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices subject to normal competitive conditions there can be no assurances however that the company will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices in addition the company continues to identify ongoing cost savings initiativescritical accounting policiesthe companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the companys consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k however certain of the companys accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the companys financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the companys management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying those policies the companys management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on the companys historical experience the companys observance of trends in the industry information provided by the companys customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis the company reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in the companys business the companys critical accounting policies includeinventory valuation  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost being determined on the firstin firstout method the company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the companys forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value the company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including but not limited to historical usage future demand and market requirements reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of product sold if the future demand for the companys products is less favorable than the companys forecasts then the value of the inventories may be required to be reduced which could result in material additional expense to the company and have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements inventory writedowns to net realizable value recognized in the ordinary course of business were not material for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 inventories were 14809 million and 13745 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelygoodwill and other intangible assets  the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired the company performs annual impairment tests and reevaluates the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at its annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist the company uses a twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment the company should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the 50table of contents excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the companys reporting units include the us canada new zealand and italy in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statementsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of the companys reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections if the company used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 pursuant to the companys accounting policy the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of the companys reporting units as the fair value of each of the companys reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis the fair value of the companys italian new zealand us and canadian reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 181 31 17 and 9 respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of its annual goodwill impairment analysis the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of the companys reporting units the fair value of the italian reporting unit approximated the carrying value as the company acquired the remaining 501 equity interest in ruffino on october 5 2011 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of its annual goodwill impairment analysis the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of the companys reporting units goodwill was 27223 million and 26329 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelythe companys other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized these trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty methodology the estimated fair value of trademarks is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by the company to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future the company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statementsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual cash flow projections if the company used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that 51table of contents was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its fair value except for the trademarks associated with the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian businessin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 pursuant to the companys accounting policy the company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment no indication of impairment was noted for any of the companys indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2013 if the company used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points then the company would have recorded an impairment loss for the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 160 million if the company used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher then the company would have recorded an impairment loss for the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 50 million if the company used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower then the company would have recorded an impairment loss for the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 40 million if the company used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower then the company would have recorded an impairment loss for the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 10 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 pursuant to the companys accounting policy the company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment the company determined that trademarks associated with the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian business were impaired while the constellation wines and spirits segments overall canadian business experienced growth the growth has been largely due to new product development and expansion of the import portfolio with a negative revenue trend over the past few years in the portfolio of brands represented by the acquired trademarks in the forecast used in the annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the company included the expected revenue benefits from targeted brand building actions for the portfolio of brands represented by the acquired trademarks during fiscal 2012 the expected revenue benefits from these targeted brand building actions were less than forecasted leading the company to believe that the inherent value of the acquired trademarks would be viewed as diminished by a market participant in the forecast used in the annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the company included expected revenue benefits from planned additional brand building actions throughout fiscal 2013 that were designed to reverse the negative revenue trend and improve growth within the portfolio of brands represented by the acquired trademarks however to reflect a market participants view of a lower inherent value of the acquired trademarks in respect of the negative revenue trends and uncertainty around the effectiveness of the brand building activities the royalty rate applied to the forecasted revenue included a 100 basis point reduction in the royalty rate as compared to the prior year in addition the company also reduced the annual cash flow projections for the portfolio of brands represented by the acquired trademarks as a result of this review the company recorded an impairment loss of 381 million which is included in impairment of intangible assets on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income and of which amount 311 million is attributable to the reduction in the royalty rate and 70 million is attributable to the reduction in the annual cash flow projections if the company used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points then the impairment loss would have increased by an additional 160 million if the company used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher then the impairment loss would have increased by an additional 60 million if the company used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower then the impairment loss would have increased by an additional 40 million if the company used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower then the impairment loss would have increased by an additional 10 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment the company determined that trademarks associated with the constellation wines and spirits segments canadian business were impaired as a result of this review the company recorded an impairment loss of 167 million which is included in impairment of intangible assets on the companys consolidated statements of operations the company had previously recorded an impairment loss of 69 million during its third quarter of fiscal 2011 in connection with the companys decision to discontinue certain wine brands within its constellation wines and spirits 52table of contents segments us wine portfolio intangible assets with indefinite lives were 8145 million and 8036 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelyaccounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in the companys estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements promotional costs were 4794 million 4185 million and 6990 million for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively accrued promotion costs were 735 million and 576 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelyaccounting for stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation cost is calculated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense net of estimated prevesting forfeitures ratably over the vesting period of the award the company uses the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of its option and purchase right awards the company uses the monte carlo simulation model to calculate the grant date fair value of its performance share unit awards which contain a market condition the calculation of fair value of stockbased awards requires the input of assumptions including the expected term of the stockbased awards and the associated stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased awards represent the companys best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if factors change and the company uses different assumptions then stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future if the company used an expected term for its stockbased awards that was one year longer the fair value of stockbased awards granted during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 and for the years ended february 28 2010 fiscal 2010 and february 28 2009 fiscal 2009 would have increased by 159 million resulting in an increase of 18 million of stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2013 if the company used an expected term of the stockbased awards that was one year shorter the fair value of the stockbased awards granted during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 would have decreased by 131 million resulting in a decrease of 17 million of stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2013 the total amount of stockbased compensation recognized for fiscal 2013 was 412 million of which 371 million was expensed for fiscal 2013 and 41 million was capitalized in inventory as of february 28 2013 the total amount of stockbased compensation recognized for fiscal 2012 was 474 million of which 437 million was expensed for fiscal 2012 and 37 million was capitalized in inventory as of february 29 2012 the total amount of stockbased compensation recognized for fiscal 2011 was 470 million of which 431 million was expensed for fiscal 2011 and 39 million was capitalized in inventory as of february 28 2011accounting for income taxes  the company estimates its income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies the company is subject to income taxes in the us canada new zealand italy and other jurisdictions the company recognizes its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income if necessary the company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets if the realization of the asset appears doubtful the company believes that all tax positions are fully supported however the company records tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the companys current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change the companys current estimate of 53table of contents its tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates if significant could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial statements the annual effective tax rate was 249 167 and 15 for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectivelyaccounting for business combinations  the acquisition of businesses is an important element of the companys strategy under the acquisition method the company is required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the companys financial statements for example the companys acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets was 72 million 54 million and 55 million for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively amortizable intangible assets were 569 million and 628 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelyaccounting guidance not yet adopteddisclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december 2011 the fasb

transfer the allowance for doubtful accounts was 19 million and 15 million as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 respectivelyfair value of financial instruments the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available when quoted market prices are not available the company uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments such as forwards options swaps etc which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows see note 5derivative instruments as a multinational company the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates diesel fuel prices and interest rates that could affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the amount of volatility realized will vary based upon the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding during a particular period of time as well as the currency fuel pricing and interest rate market movements during that same period66table of contents the company enters into derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps foreign currency forward and option contracts and diesel fuel swaps to manage interest rate foreign currency and diesel fuel pricing risks respectively in accordance with the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value see note 4 note 5 the fair values of the companys derivative instruments change with fluctuations in interest rates currency rates andor fuel prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures the companys derivative instruments are held solely to hedge economic exposures the company follows strict policies to manage interest rate foreign currency and diesel fuel pricing risks including prohibitions on derivative marketmaking or other speculative activitiesto qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement including the risk management objective hedging strategy hedged item specific risk that is being hedged the derivative instrument how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured the derivative must be highly effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows as appropriate of the risk being hedged effectiveness is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative measurescertain of the companys derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging for others the company chooses not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment these undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge the companys exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency investments primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to repatriation of those loans or investments foreign currency contracts generally less than 12 months in duration are used to hedge some of these risks the companys derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives when the derivative instrument is settled within the fiscal quarter or offsets a recognized balance sheet exposure in these circumstances the mark to fair value is reported currently through earnings in selling general and administrative expenses on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 the company had undesignated foreign currency contracts outstanding with a notional value of 3551 million and 1486 million respectively in addition the company had offsetting undesignated interest rate swap agreements with an absolute notional amount of 10 billion outstanding as of february 28 2013 see note 10 the company had no undesignated interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of february 29 2012furthermore when the company determines that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively the company also discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when i a derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriatecash flow hedgesthe company is exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases and historically third party financing arrangements the company primarily uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain of these risks in addition the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and diesel fuel swaps to manage its exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices derivatives managing the companys cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less with a maximum maturity of five years throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed all components of the companys derivative instruments gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in the event the relationship is no longer effective the company recognizes the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in conjunction with its effectiveness testing the company also evaluates ineffectiveness associated with the hedge relationship resulting ineffectiveness if any is recognized immediately on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in selling general and administrative expenses67table of contents the company records the fair value of its foreign currency contracts interest rate swap contracts and diesel fuel swap contracts qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting treatment on its consolidated balance sheets with the effective portion of the related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders equity as a component of aoci these deferred gains or losses are recognized on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the same period in which the underlying hedged items are recognized and on the same line item as the underlying hedged items however to the extent that any derivative instrument is not considered to be highly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item the hedging relationship is terminated and the amount related to the ineffective portion of such derivative instrument is immediately recognized on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income in selling general and administrative expensesas of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 the company had cash flow designated foreign currency contracts outstanding with a notional value of 2203 million and 3537 million respectively in addition as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 the company had cash flow

of income tax effect to be reclassified from aoci to earnings within the next 12 monthsfair value hedgesfair value hedges are hedges that offset the risk of changes in the fair values of recorded assets and liabilities and firm commitments the company records changes in fair value of derivative instruments which are designated and deemed effective as fair value hedges in earnings offset by the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items the company did not designate any derivative instruments as fair value hedges for the years ended february 28 2013 february 29 2012 and

currency accordingly gains and losses on these instruments were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in aoci the company did not designate any derivative or nonderivative instruments

components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity in addition this amended guidance requires retrospective

the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test would be unnecessary if an entity concludes otherwise the entity would be required to complete the twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and then comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit the adoption of this amended guidance on march 1 2012 did not have a material impact on the companys

measurements this guidance emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the fair value measurement guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly and level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for
