varieties of grapes grown principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate nine wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy

production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our mexican beer brands at our brewery include water agricultural products such as malt hops and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboard packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2014 the package format mix of our beer volume sold in the us was 78 glass bottles 21 aluminum cans and 1 in stainless steel kegsthe brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the brewerys ongoing requirements and future requirements after completing the brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we have entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of glass aluminum cans can lids crowns caps cartons malt hops corn starch and yeast for a period of 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and supply arrangements for the beer business operations are ongoing and progressing we believe that abi will have adequate sources of the materials noted above to meet our sales expectationsthe principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 1040 independent growers in the us approximately 100 independent growers in canada approximately 80 independent growers in new zealand and approximately 10 independent growers in italy we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 28 2014 we owned or leased approximately 20000 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of our superpremium and fine wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time6table of contentswe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a

health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affected while over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about

also directly to government agencies while in canada we sell our products principally to government agencies in the us we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our us wine and spirits sales the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longerterm sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels particularly in the us if we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment our net income market share and volume growth could be negatively

wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitorsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssince the beer business acquisition sales of the mexican beer brands in the us have become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the

thirdparty service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed we do not ultimately control their performance their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result

beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through calendar year 2016 although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after the initial brewery expansion is completed our brewery may become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 55 of our current projected product requirements we intend to expand the brewerys capacity over a threeyear period ending in calendar year 2016 and thus we have entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years there can be no assurance that any requested extension would be grantedwe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated expansion of our brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition the brewery may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at the brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses15table of contentssupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materialsthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the brewery our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields our brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the brewerys ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansion there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available to the brewery our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsthe brewery our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water the brewery our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities also use a significant amount of energy in their operations the supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedcatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 345 million cases or approximately 529 of our global wine and spirits product annually additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries and our lodi distribution center in lodi ca are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial loss16table of contentsraw materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts and limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesour business is heavily dependent upon raw materials such as grapes grape juice concentrate grains alcohol and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers we could experience raw material supply production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us the prices for raw materials and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers fluctuate depending upon market conditions for example in the past we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectationsthe wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply in a severe oversupply environment the ability of wine producers including ourselves to raise prices is limited and in certain situations the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices further although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment substantial increases in the prices of raw materials and packaging materials including those from thirdparty suppliers to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the price of our finished products would increase our operating costs and could decrease our profitability our net sales could be impacted negatively if our customers cannot afford our productsglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently purchase from abi all of the glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businessvarious diseases pests and certain weather conditionsvarious diseases pests fungi viruses drought frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs andor reduce production of grapes or other crops growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supplyclimate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate changeour business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters severe weather events such as the recent drought in california and prolonged cold winter in new york and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products severe weather events or

taxes on our products business customers or consumers various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years many us states have considered proposals to increase and some of these states have increased state alcohol excise taxes there may be further consideration by federal state provincial local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate in addition federal state provincial local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing warehousing trade and pricing practices permitted and required labeling advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers certain federal state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage new or

these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs there

alcohol industry which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol including drinking and driving underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol we also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our businessdamage to our reputationmaintaining a good reputation is critical to

acquisitions  beer business acquisitionour business strategy in the wine and spirits segment is centered on continued focus on consumerpreferred premium wine brands complemented by premium spirits in this segment we continue to focus on growing premium product categories we have consolidated our us distribution network in markets where it was feasible which currently represents about 70 of our branded wine and spirits volume in the us in order to obtain dedicated selling resources which focus on our us wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth throughout the terms of these contracts we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors shipments to essentially equal the distributors shipments to retailers depletions in addition we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our us focus brands as they represent a majority of our us wine and spirits revenue and profitability and have strong positions in their respective price segmentswe believe the current overall supply of wine is generally in balance with demand within the us the calendar 2013 us grape harvest overall yield came in similar to the calendar 2012 us grape harvest accordingly we expect that the calendar 2013 us grape harvest may continue to provide some relief from the recent tightening of supply within certain us varietals due to relatively smaller us grape harvests in calendar 2011 and calendar 2010we remain committed to our longterm financial model of growing sales expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was substantially impacted by the benefit from additional foreign tax credits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 reflects decreases in uncertain tax positions of 852 million and other tax adjustments of 425 million in connection with the completion of various income tax examinations during fiscal 2012 and a change in the method of filing certain state income tax returnsnet incomeas a result of the above factors net income decreased to 3878 million for fiscal 2013 from 4450 million for fiscal 2012 a decrease of 572 million or 13financial liquidity and capital resourcesgeneralour principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations except during annual grape harvests when we have relied on shortterm borrowings in the us canada and italy the annual grape crush normally begins in august and runs through october in new zealand the annual grape crush normally begins in february and runs through may we generally begin taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with the majority of payments for such grapes coming due within 90 days our shortterm borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended historically we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our shortterm borrowings and fund capital expenditures we will continue to use our shortterm borrowings including our accounts receivable securitization facilities see additional discussion below under accounts receivable securitization facilities to support our working capital requirementswe have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt absent deterioration of market conditions we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities primarily shortterm borrowings will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital scheduled principal and interest payments on debt and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our shortterm and longterm capital needs35table of contentsas of april 22 2014 we had a borrowing capacity of 8352 million available under our 2013 credit agreement the member financial institutions participating in our 2013 credit agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe the member financial institutions will comply with ongoing funding requests however there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so in the future in addition the cbi

partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation expense the net cash used in the net change in our operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts payable of 493 million and an increase in inventories of 411 million partially offset by an increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities of 581 million and a decrease in accounts receivable net of 365 million the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payments the increase in inventories is primarily due to higher us wine inventory levels resulting largely from an above average calendar 2013 us grape harvest combined with unfavorable product mix in net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 partially offset by lower beer inventory levels due largely to timing as early june inventory levels from the beer business acquisition were at higher levels as compared to the end of february to support the strong summer selling season for beer the increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities is largely due to increases in income taxes payable accrued salaries and benefits and accrued advertising and promotions the increase in

connection with the beer business acquisition the total brewery expansion is estimated to be from 900 million to 11 billioneffects of inflation and changing pricesour results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices subject to normal competitive conditions there can be no assurances however that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices in addition we continue to identify ongoing cost savings initiativescritical accounting estimatesour significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements however certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying those policies management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business our critical accounting estimates includegoodwill and other intangible assets  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the twostep impairment test in the first step the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other 43table of contentsthan goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill our reporting units include the beer segment and us canada new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units as the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis of all of the wine and spirits segments reporting units the reporting unit with the lowest amount of fair value in excess of its carrying value was the canadian reporting unit by approximately 22 the fair value of the beer reporting unit approximated its carrying value as we closed the beer business acquisition on june 7 2013 we had previously recorded an impairment loss of 2787 million which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 in connection with the wine and spirits segments canadian reporting unit in both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting unitsour other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty methodology the estimated fair value of trademarks is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements44table of contentsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual cash flow projections if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its fair value except for the trademarks associated with the wine and spirits segments canadian businessin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review if we used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the wine and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 97 million if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the wine and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 17 million if we used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the wine and spirits segments canadian trademarks of approximately 06 million no impairment loss would have been recorded for the wine and spirits segments canadian trademarks if we used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower we had previously recorded an impairment loss of 222 million which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits segments canadian business no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2013 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we recorded an impairment loss of 381 million which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits segments canadian businessaccounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation cost is calculated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense net of estimated prevesting forfeitures ratably over the vesting period of the award we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the grantdate fair value of our option and purchase right awards we use the monte carlo simulation model to calculate the grantdate fair value of our performance share unit awards which contain a market condition the calculation of fair value of stockbased awards requires the input of assumptions including the expected term of the stockbased awards and the associated stock price volatility the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions then stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future if we used an expected term for our stockbased awards that was one year longer the fair value of stockbased awards granted during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 and for the years ended february 28 2011 fiscal 2011 and february 28 2010 fiscal 2010 would have increased by 89 million resulting in an increase of 14 million of stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2014 if we used an expected term of our stockbased awards that was one year shorter the fair value of our stockbased awards granted during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 would have 45table of contentsdecreased by 92 million resulting in a decrease of 18 million of stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2014accounting for income taxes  we estimate our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies we are subject to income taxes in canada luxembourg mexico new zealand the us and other jurisdictions we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income if necessary we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets if the realization of the asset appears doubtful we believe that all tax positions are fully supported however we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates if significant could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for business combinations  the acquisition of businesses is an important element of our strategy under the acquisition method we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements for example our acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurredaccounting guidance not yet adoptedaccounting guidance adopted on march 1 2014 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted refer to note
