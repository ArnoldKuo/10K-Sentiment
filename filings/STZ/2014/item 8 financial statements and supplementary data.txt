instruments such as forwards options swaps etc which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows see note 7derivative instrumentsas a multinational company the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates that could affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the amount of volatility realized will vary based upon the effectiveness and level of derivative 60table of contentsinstruments outstanding during a particular period of time as well as the currency commodity and interest rate market movements during that same periodthe company enters into derivative instruments primarily foreign currency forward and option contracts commodity pricing swaps and interest rate swaps to manage foreign currency commodity pricing and interest rate risks respectively the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value see note 6 note 7 the fair values of the companys derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates commodity prices andor interest rates and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures the companys derivative instruments are held solely to hedge economic exposures the company follows strict policies to manage foreign currency commodity pricing and interest rate risks including prohibitions on derivative marketmaking or other speculative activitiesto qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement including the risk management objective hedging strategy hedged item specific risk that is being hedged the derivative instrument how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured the derivative must be highly effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows as appropriate of the risk being hedged effectiveness is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative and qualitative measuresfurthermore when the company determines that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively the company also discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when i a derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriatecertain of the companys derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the fasb guidance for derivatives and hedging for others the company chooses not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment these undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge the companys exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables foreign currency investments primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments and commodity prices primarily consisting of diesel fuel corn and natural gas prices foreign currency contracts generally less than 12 months in duration and commodity swap contracts generally less than 36 months in duration are used to hedge some of these risks the companys derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior managementfor these undesignated instruments the mark to fair value is reported currently through earnings on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income for purposes of measuring segment operating performance the unrealized gains or losses from the mark to fair value of the companys undesignated commodity swap contracts are reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is realized in the segment operating results at that time the realized gains or losses from the mark to fair value of the undesignated commodity swap contracts are reported in the appropriate operating segment allowing the companys operating segments to realize the economic effects of the commodity swap contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility the net unrealized gain reported outside of segment operating results for the year ended february 28 2014 was not material there were no amounts reported outside of segment operating results for the years

the fasb guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and requires disclosures about fair value measurements this guidance emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the fair value measurement guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly and level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability75table of contentsthe following table presents the companys financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value

company identified certain negative trends within its wine and spirits canadian reporting unit which when combined with recent changes in strategy within the canadian business indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit might be below its carrying value these negative trends included a reduction in market growth rates for certain segments of the domestic canadian wine industry as well as the identification that certain improvement initiatives had not materialized in segments of the canadian business such as refreshments and wine kits in addition imported brands have been experiencing market growth within the canadian market and certain of the companys noncanadian branded wine products imported into canada provide higher margin to the company on a consolidated basis accordingly the company has modified its strategy to capitalize on this trend and shift focus from certain segments of the domestic business to imported brands the canadian reporting unit realizes only a portion of the overall profit attributable to imported brands whereas it realizes all of the profit attributable to the domestic business therefore the company performed the twostep process to evaluate goodwill for impairment for the wine and spirits canadian reporting unit in the first step the estimated fair value of the canadian reporting unit was compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit was determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step was performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment the company should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the estimated fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the company considered estimates of future operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit discounted using market based discount rates the estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from the companys updated longterm financial forecast which was developed as part of the companys new strategy for the canadian business the decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment loss was primarily driven by the updated longterm financial forecasts which showed lower estimated future operating results primarily due to the change in the companys strategy for the canadian business the implied fair value of the canadian reporting units goodwill of 1596 million compared to the carrying value of the canadian reporting units goodwill of 4339 million resulted in the recognition of an impairment of 2787 million this impairment is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive incometrademarksfor the three months ended august 31 2013 prior to the goodwill impairment analysis discussed above the company performed a review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment the company determined that certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits segments canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profits associated with the related products included in the updated longterm financial forecasts developed as part of the companys new strategy for the canadian business accordingly trademarks with a 77table of contentscarrying value of 902 million were written down to their estimated fair value of 683 million resulting in an impairment of 222 millionfor the year ended february 29 2012 pursuant to the companys accounting policy the company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment the company determined that certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits segments canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profitability associated with products incorporating these assets included in longterm financial forecasts developed as part of the strategic planning cycle conducted during the companys fourth quarter accordingly trademarks with a carrying value of 1344 million were written down to their estimated fair value of 960 million resulting in an impairment of 381 millionthese impairments are included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the respective periods for each period the company measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values the estimated fair value was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method which assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of trademark assets the cash flow projections the company uses to estimate the fair values of its trademarks involve several assumptions including i projected revenue growth rates ii estimated royalty rates iii calculated aftertax royalty savings expected from ownership of the subject trademarks and iv discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the estimated fair value of the trademarks8
