varieties of grapes grown principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate nine wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy

production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our mexican beer brands at our brewery include water agricultural products such as malt hops and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboard packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2014 the package format mix of our beer volume sold in the us was 78 glass bottles 21 aluminum cans and 1 in stainless steel kegsthe brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the brewerys ongoing requirements and future requirements after completing the brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we have entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of glass aluminum cans can lids crowns caps cartons malt hops corn starch and yeast for a period of 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and supply arrangements for the beer business operations are ongoing and progressing we believe that abi will have adequate sources of the materials noted above to meet our sales expectationsthe principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 1040 independent growers in the us approximately 100 independent growers in canada approximately 80 independent growers in new zealand and approximately 10 independent growers in italy we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 28 2014 we owned or leased approximately 20000 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of our superpremium and fine wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time6table of contentswe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a

in the consumption of products we sellwe rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affected while over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and drivinga general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in onpremise establishments such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcoholconsumer dietary preferences favoring lighter lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks sports drinks and water productsthe increased activity of antialcohol

ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers the launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch among other things can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation unsuccessful implementation or shortlived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory writeoffs and other costsreliance on wholesale distributors major retailers and government agencieslocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide within our primary market in the us we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer branded wine and spirits categories with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio in the us we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores club and discount stores package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies while in canada we sell our products principally to government agencies in the us we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our us wine and spirits sales the replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longerterm sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels particularly in the us if we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment our net income market share and volume growth could be negatively affected in addition wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space promotional support and consumer purchases accordingly wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitorsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssince the beer business acquisition sales of the mexican beer brands in the us have become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationsreliance upon complex information systems and third party global networkswe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach we recognize that many groups on a worldwide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity we have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats however as with all large information technology systems our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information corrupting our information disrupting our business processes or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees customers or consumers such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues litigation remediation costs damage to our reputation or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations14table of contentswe have outsourced various functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future we rely on those thirdparty service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed we do not ultimately control their performance their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations which could materially affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basisin connection with the beer business acquisition we currently receive various services pursuant to our transition services

our business financial condition operating results and cash flow and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basissupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through calendar year 2016 although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after the initial brewery expansion is completed our brewery may become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 55 of our current projected product requirements we intend to expand the brewerys capacity over a threeyear period ending in calendar year 2016 and thus we have entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years there can be no assurance that any requested extension would be grantedwe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated expansion of our brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition the brewery may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at the brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses15table of contentssupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materialsthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the brewery our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields our brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the brewerys ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansion there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future if water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available to the brewery our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsthe brewery our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water the brewery our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities also use a significant amount of energy in their operations the supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedcatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 345 million cases or approximately 529 of our global wine and spirits product annually additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries and our lodi distribution center in lodi ca are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial loss16table of contentsraw materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts and limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesour business is heavily dependent upon raw materials such as grapes grape juice concentrate grains alcohol and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers we could experience raw material supply production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us the prices for raw materials and packaging materials from thirdparty suppliers fluctuate depending upon market conditions for example in the past we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectationsthe wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply in a severe oversupply environment the ability of wine producers including ourselves to raise prices is limited and in certain situations the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices further although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment substantial increases in the prices of raw materials and packaging materials including those from thirdparty suppliers to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the price of our finished products would increase our operating costs and could decrease our profitability our net sales could be impacted negatively if our customers cannot afford our productsglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently purchase from abi all of the glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businessvarious diseases pests and certain weather conditionsvarious diseases pests fungi viruses drought frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability we cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs andor reduce production of grapes or other crops growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops which could lead to a shortage of our product supplyclimate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate changeour business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources there has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters severe weather events such as the recent drought in california and prolonged cold winter in new york and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain which may affect production operations insurance cost and coverage as well as delivery of our products to

beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change significant increases in import and 17table of contentsexcise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the us federal budget and individual state provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products business customers or consumers various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years many us states have considered proposals to increase and some of these states have increased state alcohol excise taxes there may be further consideration by federal state provincial local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate in addition federal state provincial local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing warehousing trade and pricing practices permitted and required labeling advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers certain federal state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationsbenefit cost increasesour profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits in recent years employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the us these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditionintangible assets such as goodwill and trademarkswe continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards the writedown of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net incomeclass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse the misuse of alcohol product liability or marketing or sales practices there has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol including drinking and driving underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol we also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our businessdamage to our reputationmaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality safety and integrity including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers and we also audit our suppliers compliance with our standards it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements if any of our products becomes unfit for consumption is misbranded or causes injury we may have to engage in a product recall andor be subject to liability and incur additional costs a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time which could further reduce
