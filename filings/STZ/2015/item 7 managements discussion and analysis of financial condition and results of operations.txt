entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with anheuserbusch inbev sanv abi in june 2013 this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting through the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj has a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years we intend to expand the brewerys capacity to 25 million hectoliters the initial brewery expansion from 10 to 20 million hectoliters is targeted to be completed in june 2016 and is anticipated to meet our

to be complete by the end of calendar year 20175table of contentsin the us we operate 19 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the napa sonoma monterey and san joaquin regions of california we also operate eight wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy and in march through may in new zealandour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our mexican beer brands at our brewery include water agricultural products such as malt hops and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboard packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2015 the package format mix of our beer volume sold in the us was 76 glass bottles 22 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the brewerys ongoing requirements and future requirements after completing the brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of materials needed to produce and package beer for varying periods up to 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and independent supply arrangements for the beer business operations are progressing or have occurred we believe that abi will have adequate sources of the materials noted above to meet our sales expectationsas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our brewery in nava mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has one operational glass furnace and the joint venture intends to scale it to four furnaces over the next four years when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply more than 50 of our beer glass requirements we also entered into longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producers during fiscal 2015the principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 980 independent growers in the us and approximately 240 independent growers located primarily in canada and new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 28 2015 we owned or leased approximately 20800 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supply6table of contentswe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present timewe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate where we

major category as a result in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases our imported beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year which correspond to the spring and summer periods in the us our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year primarily due to seasonal holiday

sales of the mexican beer brands in the us have become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through calendar year 2016 although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after our brewery expansions are completed our brewery may become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately half of our current projected product requirements we are in the process of expanding the brewerys capacity over a threeyear period the first phase which is intended to make us selfsufficient is targeted to be complete in calendar year 2016 the second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar year 2017 in 2013 we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years there can be no assurance that any requested extension would be grantedour brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we recently formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our brewery the mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility within the next four years in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated expansion of our brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition the brewery may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at the brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint ventures mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable lossessupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materials certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the brewery our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards and 12table of

substantial wine operations in the state of california which has endured an extended period of drought and has recently instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries continued or more severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions our brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate the brewery and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansions there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the futureif water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to the brewery our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsthe brewery the glass plant our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water the brewery our wineries and our

of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we have various suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 370 million cases or approximately 582 of our global wine and spirits product annually additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries and our lodi distribution center in lodi ca are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one 13table of contentslocation such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that

by inflation and changing prices we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices subject to normal competitive conditions there can be no assurances however that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices in addition we continue to identify ongoing cost savings initiativescritical accounting estimatesour significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements however certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty in applying those policies management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business our critical accounting estimates include43table of contentsgoodwill and other intangible assets  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the twostep impairment test in the first step the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill our reporting units include the beer segment and us canada new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis of all of our reporting units the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits us reporting unit by approximately 18 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 2787 million in connection with the wine and spirits canadian reporting unit in fiscal 2013 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting unitsthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections as of january 1 2015 if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its estimated fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyour other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized the 44table of contentsguidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 222 million in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian business no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2013the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual revenue projections as of january 1 2015 if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value except for the trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian business if we used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the wine and spirits canadian trademarks of approximately 36 million no impairment loss would have been recorded for the wine and spirits canadian trademarks if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher an expected long term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points loweraccounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations regarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for income taxes  we estimate our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies we are subject to income taxes in canada luxembourg mexico new zealand the us and other jurisdictions we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts 45table of contentsrecognized in our results of operations if necessary we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets if the realization of the asset appears doubtful we believe that all tax positions are fully supported however we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates if significant could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting guidance not yet adoptedaccounting guidance adopted on march 1 2014 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for information
