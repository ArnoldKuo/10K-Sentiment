considered among other factors market participants intentions to use the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for the acquired mexican beer brands the estimated fair values for the customer relationships and the copyrights were determined using a cost approach the estimated fair value for the distribution agreement was determined using an income approach the estimated fair value for the favorable supply contract was determined using an income approach specifically the differential method the estimated fair value for the trademarks was determined using an income approach specifically the relief from royalty methodthe intangible assets are being amortized either on a straightline basis or an economic consumption basis which is consistent with the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be utilized based upon estimated cash flows generated from such assets goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the distribution of the mexican beer brands in the us as well as complete control over the sourcing of product into the us approximately 16470 million of the goodwill recognized is expected to be

operations we also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when i a derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised ii it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or iii we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate when we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in aoci and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs when it becomes probable

instrumentsauthoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements for financial instruments this guidance emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability it establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy includes three levelslevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability either directly or indirectly andlevel 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liabilityfair value methodology and assumptions the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instrumentsforeign currency and commodity derivative contracts  our foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts and our commodity derivative contracts consist of swap contracts the fair value is estimated using marketbased inputs obtained from independent pricing services into valuation models these valuation models require various inputs including contractual terms market foreign exchange prices market commodity prices interestrate yield curves and currency volatilities as

2787trademarks  683 222   2279 3009goodwillfor the three months ended august 31 2013 we identified certain negative trends within our wine and spirits canadian reporting unit which when combined with changes in strategy within the canadian business indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit might be below its carrying value these trends included a reduction in market growth rates for certain portions of the domestic canadian wine industry as well as the identification that certain improvement initiatives had not materialized in parts of the canadian business such as refreshments and wine kits in addition imported brands had been experiencing market growth within the canadian market and certain of our noncanadian branded wine products imported into canada provided higher margin to us on a consolidated basis accordingly we modified our strategy to capitalize on this trend and shift focus from certain portions of the domestic business to imported brands the canadian reporting unit realizes only a piece of the overall profit attributable to imported brands whereas it realizes all of the profit attributable to the domestic business therefore we evaluated our goodwill for impairment using the twostep processin the first step the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was compared to its carrying value including goodwill the estimate of fair value was determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows as the estimated 73table of contentsfair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step was performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the estimated fair value of the reporting units assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit we considered estimates of future operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit discounted using market based discount rates the estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from updated longterm financial forecasts which were developed as part of the change in strategy for the canadian business the decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment loss was primarily driven by the updated longterm financial forecasts which showed lower estimated future operating results primarily due to the change in strategy for the canadian business the implied fair value of the canadian reporting units goodwill of 1596 million compared to its carrying value of 4339 million resulted in the recognition of an impairment of 2787 milliontrademarksfor the three months ended august 31 2013 prior to the goodwill impairment analysis discussed above we performed a review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment we determined that certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profits associated with the related products included in the updated longterm financial forecasts developed as part of the change in strategy for the canadian business accordingly trademarks with a carrying value of 902 million were written down to their estimated fair value of 683 million resulting in an impairment of 222 millionwe measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values the estimated fair value was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method which assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of trademark assets the cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair values of our trademarks involve several assumptions including i projected revenue growth rates ii estimated royalty rates iii aftertax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks and iv discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademarks8 goodwillthe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows beer wine and spirits consolidatedin millions     balance february 28 201437146 24322
