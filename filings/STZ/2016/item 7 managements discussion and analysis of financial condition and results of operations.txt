the current nava brewery capacity we entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with anheuserbusch inbev sanv abi in june 2013 this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting through the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj has a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three yearswhile we remain on track with the nava brewery expansion activity we have extended the interim supply agreement through june 2017 in order to support the

california we also operate eight wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy and in march through may in new zealand6table of contentsour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our craft and mexican beer brands include water agricultural products such as malt hops yeast and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboardfor our mexican beer brands packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2016 the package format mix of our mexican beer volume sold in the us was 74 glass bottles 24 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe nava brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the nava brewerys ongoing and future requirements after completing the nava brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of materials needed to produce and package beer for varying periods up to 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and independent supply arrangements for the beer business operations have essentially been completedas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has one operational glass furnace and the joint venture intends to scale it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018 when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 50 of our glass requirements for the nava brewery we also entered into longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producers during fiscal 2015the principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 960 independent growers in the us and approximately 220 independent growers located primarily in canada and new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 29 2016 we owned or leased approximately 21700 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time7table of contentswe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the

cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers distributors retailers and consumers the inability of suppliers distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products we have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us while to date we have not experienced problems with accessing

contentsinadequate levels of compliance with applicable antibribery laws including the foreign corrupt practices act andother challenges caused by distance language and cultural differencesour success will depend in part on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting us companies with global operations although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations including anticorruption laws there can be no assurance that our employees business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable us or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties interruptions of business terminations of necessary licenses and permits and other legal and equitable sanctionswe are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future we manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks we could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks we could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations unstable governments unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes these currency economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition especially to the extent these matters or the decisions policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors affect our global operationscompetitionwe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors includingour inability to maintain or increase pricesnew entrants in our market or categoriesa general decline in beverage alcohol consumption orthe decision of wholesalers or consumers to purchase a competitors product instead of oursunit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing purchasing financing operational advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers state and provincial agencies and retailers which could affect their supply of or consumer demand for our products we could also experience higher than expected selling general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasonsdependence on sales of our mexican beer brandssince the beer business acquisition sales of the mexican beer brands in the us have become a more significant portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our nava brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through june 2017 although we are in the process of 12table of contentsconstructing an additional brewery in mexicali baja california mexico with the first phase targeted for completion in calendar 2019 our nava brewery may for a period of time become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60 of our current product requirements and before the end of calendar 2016 its capacity is expected to increase to allow it to fill approximately 80 of our projected product requirements we are in the process of further expanding the nava brewerys capacity over a threeyear period the first phase which was intended to make us selfsufficient is targeted to be complete in calendar 2016 the second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2017 and the third phase to support additional growth of the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2018 in 2013 we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years the term of this interim supply agreement has been extended for one additional year as to a select number of products to ensure additional supply beyond the initial nava expansion to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity the interim supply agreement will now expire in june 2017 there can be no assurance that any additional requested extension would be grantedour nava brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery the mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility by early calendar 2018 in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated initial expansion of our nava brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition and the additional incremental expansions of the nava brewery and construction of the mexicali brewery to support further growth of our business are not completed by their targeted completion dates we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at our nava brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint ventures mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable lossessupply of quality water agricultural and other raw materials certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under shortterm supply contracts limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fieldswe have substantial wine operations in the state of california which has endured an extended period of drought and has instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries continued or more severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those operations which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions our nava brewery 13table of contentsand the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their ongoing requirements including as a result of the anticipated expansions there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the futureif water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to our breweries our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour breweries the glass plant our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the nava brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt hops yeast and water as well as corn sugars spices and fruits the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water our breweries our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities including the glass plant also use a significant amount of energy in their operations including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities the supply and price of raw materials packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including market demand global geopolitical events especially as to their impact on crude oil prices droughts and other weather conditions economic factors affecting growth decisions inflation plant diseases and theft to the extent any of the foregoing factors including supply of goods and energy affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations approximately 80 of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 36 million cases or approximately 70 of our us production which is approximately 55 of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries our lodi distribution center in lodi ca and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may 14table of contentsbe at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful if one or more significant uninsured events occur we could suffer a major financial lossexpansion issues construction issues and operational disruptionswe are currently expanding our nava brewery and constructing our mexicali brewery and our joint venture with owensillinois is expanding the glass plant while these multimillion dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns our supply of mexican beer brands would be negatively impacted if a serious delay in these expansion or construction activities were to occur leading to a negative impact upon our results of operation and financial conditionexpansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatory and developmental risks including but not limited to i our

water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us and iv inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies including electricity natural gas and diesel fuelmany of our production facilities such as our breweries wineries and distillery and the mexican glass plant held by the joint venture with owensillinois are asset intensive our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace in such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges unexpected capital spending or product supply constraintsacquisition divestiture and joint venture strategywe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may from time to time acquire additional businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business recently these have included the meiomi wine brand the ballast point craft beer business and our agreement to acquire the prisoner wine company brand portfolio we may also divest ourselves of businesses assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business we will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations our overall internal control over financial reporting processes and our financial operations and information systems if the financial performance of our business as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired does not meet our expectations it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectationswe cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures such as revenue earnings or operating efficiency and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes complications with ongoing integration of any acquisition or joint venture including our beer business acquisition or the acquisition of a mexican glass plant by our joint venture

companies similarly in 2016 we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an initial public offering of a portion of our canadian wine business our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us among other matters to pay certain costs to make capital investments to fulfill alone our joint venture partners obligations or to purchase other parties interests even though we share control of our mexican glass plant joint venture the financial results of that joint venture are consolidated into our financial results our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest could adversely

obligations and covenants could have important consequences these consequences include or may include the followingour ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or

consumption of products we sellwe rely on consumers demand for our products consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors including changes in demographic or social trends public health policies and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes if consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands including our mexican beer brands in any of our major markets our financial results might be adversely affectedwhile over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the us and other markets in which we participate a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors includinga general decline in economic or geopolitical conditionsconcern about the health consequences of

applying those policies management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience our observance of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate on an ongoing basis we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business our critical accounting estimates includegoodwill and other intangible assets  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories i intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization ii intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and iii goodwill for intangible assets with definite lives impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired we perform annual impairment tests and reevaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the twostep impairment test in the first step the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit a second step is performed to determine the amount of goodwill impairment we should record in the second step an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill our reporting units include the beer segment and us canada new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment in estimating the fair value of the reporting units management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value based on this analysis of all of our reporting units the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits us reporting unit by approximately 43 in fiscal 2015 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we concluded that there were no indications of 46table of contentsimpairment for any of our reporting units in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 2787 million in connection with the wine and spirits canadian reporting unitthe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are i the discount rate ii the expected longterm growth rate and iii the annual cash flow projections as of january 1 2016 if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting units net assets including its goodwill exceeding its estimated fair value which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment if anyour other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives the trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized the guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value in estimating the fair value of the trademarks management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans these assumptions reflect managements estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are therefore subject to change as a result of changing market conditions if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2015 in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded an impairment loss of 222 million in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits canadian businessthe most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are i the estimated royalty rate ii the discount rate iii the expected longterm growth rate and iv the annual revenue projections as of january 1 2016 if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected longterm growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accountings carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value accounting for promotional activities  sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts on single transactions volume discounts promotional and advertising allowances coupons and rebates certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered historical trends expectations 47table of contentsregarding customer and consumer participation sales and payment trends and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting for income taxes  we estimate our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including but not limited to historical pretax operating income future estimates of pretax operating income differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies we are subject to income taxes in canada luxembourg mexico new zealand the us and other jurisdictions we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations if necessary we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized we believe that all tax positions are fully supported however we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasbs guidance for income tax accounting we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities in addition changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined changes in current estimates if significant could have a material adverse impact on our financial statementsaccounting guidance not yet
