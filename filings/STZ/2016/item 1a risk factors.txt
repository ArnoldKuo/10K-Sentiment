brewerys capacity to 275 million hectoliters with the subsequent nava brewery expansions from 20 million hectoliters to 275 million hectoliters targeted to be completed by early calendar 2018to meet our beer supply requirements above the current nava brewery capacity we entered into a threeyear interim supply agreement with anheuserbusch inbev sanv abi in june 2013 this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting through the antitrust division of the united states department of justice doj has a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three yearswhile we remain on track with the nava brewery expansion activity we have extended the interim supply agreement through june

brewery to provide 10 million hectoliters of production capacity is targeted to be completed by calendar yearend 2020 with the first 5 million hectoliters targeted to be completed by calendar yearend 2019we currently operate four facilities in the greater san diego california area that produce our ballast point brand including miramar which serves as the primary production site for the brand this

regions of california we also operate eight wineries in canada four wineries in new zealand and five wineries in italy grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk the inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each years grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent years crush wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in september through november in the us canada and italy and in march through may in new zealand6table of contentsour canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our canadian distillery in lethbridge alberta our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of canadian whisky are purchased from various supplierssources and availability of production materialsthe principal components in the production of our craft and mexican beer brands include water agricultural products such as malt hops yeast and corn starch and packaging materials which include glass aluminum and cardboardfor our mexican beer brands packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials in fiscal 2016 the package format mix of our mexican beer volume sold in the us was 74 glass bottles 24 aluminum cans and 2 in stainless steel kegsthe nava brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer we believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the nava brewerys ongoing and future requirements after completing the nava brewery expansion in connection with the beer business acquisition we entered into a transition services agreement with abi for the supply of materials needed to produce and package beer for varying periods up to 36 months from the date of the acquisition investments and efforts to establish standalone procurement systems and independent supply arrangements for the beer business operations have essentially been completedas part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the longterm we formed an equallyowned joint venture with owensillinois the worlds largest glass container manufacturer the joint venture acquired a stateoftheart glass production plant that is located adjacent to our nava brewery in mexico in december 2014 the glass plant currently has one operational glass furnace and the joint venture intends to scale it to four furnaces by early calendar 2018 when fully operational with four furnaces the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 50 of our glass requirements for the nava brewery we also entered into longterm glass supply agreements with other glass producers during fiscal 2015the principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products such as grapes and grain and packaging materials primarily glassmost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each years harvest which normally begins in august and runs through october in the us canada and italy and begins in february and runs through may in new zealand we receive grapes from approximately 960 independent growers in the us and approximately 220 independent growers located primarily in canada and new zealand we enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies yeartoyear and is generally based on thencurrent market pricesas of february 29 2016 we owned or leased approximately 21700 acres of land and vineyards either fully bearing or under development primarily in the us canada new zealand and italy this acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production however most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higherend wines we continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards and additional land for vineyard plantings to supplement our grape supplywe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations however when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the worldthe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market we believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time7table of contentswe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and other materials such as caps corks capsules labels wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products after grape purchases glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold in the us and canada the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers we have traditionally obtained and continue to obtain our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under longterm supply arrangements currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion for our canadian operations supplied by another producer we have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this timegovernment regulationwe are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate where we produce

portion of our business accordingly if the growth rate amount or profitability of our sales of the mexican beer brands in the us declines our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the beer business acquisition further consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the mexican beer brands the categories in which they compete or beer generally due to among other reasons changing taste preferences demographics or perceived value consequently any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the mexican beer brands or from the categories in which they compete could have a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition and results of operationssupply of mexican beer brandsin order to fulfill our current and projected mexican beer brands product requirements we are currently dependent on our nava brewery which is a single facility located in nava coahuila mexico and an interim supply agreement for our supply of mexican beer brands through june 2017 although we are in the process of 12table of contentsconstructing an additional brewery in mexicali baja california mexico with the first phase targeted for completion in calendar 2019 our nava brewery may for a period of time become our sole source of supply for our mexican beer brands the nava brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60 of our current product requirements and before the end of calendar 2016 its capacity is expected to increase to allow it to fill approximately 80 of our projected product requirements we are in the process of further expanding the nava brewerys capacity over a threeyear period the first phase which was intended to make us selfsufficient is targeted to be complete in calendar 2016 the second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2017 and the third phase to support additional growth of the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2018 in 2013 we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional mexican beer brands products for an initial period of three years this agreement also provides for up to two oneyear extensions however the united states acting though the doj will have a right of approval in its sole discretion of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years the term of this interim supply agreement has been extended for one additional year as to a select number of products to ensure additional supply beyond the initial nava expansion to support the robust growth levels of our mexican beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity the interim supply agreement will now expire in june 2017 there can be no assurance that any additional requested extension would be grantedour nava brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles we formed the mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our nava brewery the mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility by early calendar 2018 in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our nava brewerywe may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the nava brewery or our interim suppliers breweries also if the contemplated initial expansion of our nava brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the beer business acquisition and the additional incremental expansions of the nava brewery and construction of the mexicali brewery to support further growth of our business are not completed by their targeted completion dates we may not be able to produce sufficient mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs under such circumstances we may be unable to obtain mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source if at all a significant disruption at our nava brewery or at our suppliers breweries even on a shortterm basis could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance similarly although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint ventures mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our mexican beer products to market additionally our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the mexican beer brands a major uninsured catastrophe could

group of suppliers of glass bottlesthe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints we are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries our wineries and our distillery as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations the suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fieldswe have substantial wine operations in the state of california which has endured an extended period of drought and has instituted restrictions on water usage while we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our california vineyards and wineries continued or more severe drought conditions in california could have an adverse effect upon those

or the quality of that water deteriorates we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance even if quality water is widely available including to our breweries our wineries our distillery and our vineyards water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operationsour breweries the glass plant our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products as to the nava brewery these include corn starch malt hops and water the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand the ballast point breweries use large amounts of malt hops yeast and water as well as corn sugars spices and fruits the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water our breweries our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials including glass aluminum cardboard and other paper products our production facilities including the glass plant also use a significant amount of energy in their operations including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel

completely hedge changes in commodity price risks or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impactedglass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold we currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our mexican beer brands in the us and canada glass bottles have only a small number of producers currently one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our us operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our canadian operations supplied by another producer the inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our businesscatastrophic loss to wineries production facilities or distribution systemsthroughout the years we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations approximately 80 of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the us and three of our largest wineries are the woodbridge winery in acampo ca the mission bell winery in madera ca and the canandaigua winery in canandaigua ny these three facilities produce approximately 36 million cases or approximately 70 of our us production which is approximately 55 of the total annual constellation wine and spirits product volume globally additionally many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities such as our california wineries our lodi distribution center in lodi ca and our planned mexicali brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity if any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location such as through acts of war or terrorism fires floods earthquakes hurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance if our insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may 14table of
