corporate investments   corporate investments includes hp labs certain enterpriserelated business incubation projects and venture focused minority investments among others    sales marketing and distribution   we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including    retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores    resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups   distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers   original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution   independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products   systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and   9      table of contents    advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services    the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate    manufacturing and materials   we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors   we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers   we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing  10      table of contents commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference    international   our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth   a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 64 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2015 came from outside the united states us   for a discussion of risks attendant to hps international operations see risk factorsdue to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference    research and development   innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences   hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment   expenditures for research and development were 35 billion in fiscal 2015 34 billion in fiscal 2014 and 31 billion in fiscal 2013 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position   for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factorsif we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference    patents   our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2015 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 33000 patents which represents a slight decrease over the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2014 as a result of the separation approximately 15000 patents were transferred to hewlett packard enterprise beginning november 1 2015  11      table of contents  patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments   in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property ip from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties   for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see risk factorsour financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference    backlog   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business    seasonality   general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference    competition   we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings   the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive   we have a broad technology portfolio
