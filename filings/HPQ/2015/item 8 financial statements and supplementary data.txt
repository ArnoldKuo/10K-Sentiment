 of this form 10k   because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods    risks related to our business    if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited   we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems and movement to continuous ink supply systems a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition   in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in central and eastern europe and russia and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business    we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed   we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or  18      table of contents specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products   companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affected   we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures   industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers   because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects   even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business    if we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products services and solutions our business and financial performance may suffer   our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products services and solutions to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  19      table of contents  the process of developing new hightechnology products services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnel   after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position    if we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may suffer   in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations    we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates   currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate  20      table of contents global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states   from time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of sales    recent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance   our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses   we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliersand our suppliers from their suppliersdue to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit   economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on  21      table of contents changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses    the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable   our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period    if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could suffer   we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability   our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken  22      table of contents  our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively    we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively   our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers each of which is described below     component shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delays    excess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of   23      table of contents   favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performance     contractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition    contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws    singlesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance   24      table of contents   business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses   our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain    our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable   our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected   we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control  25      table of contents   due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance   sales outside the united states made up approximately 64 of our net revenue for fiscal 2015 in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors including    ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts   longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers   trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors   local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oems    managing a geographically dispersed workforce   changes in the international national or local regulatory and legal environments   differing technology standards or customer requirements   import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions   difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and    fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments    the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture   in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation  26                  table of contents    any failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects   as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results    managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations   we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers other thirdparties or market trends   certain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by hewlettpackard company resulted and in the future any such transactions by us may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans   any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable   our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives    the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated   in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders   we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition   our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate   an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter   business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operations   27      table of contents    if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage    we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges   as part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results    integrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospects   in order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include    successfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise   convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus    persuading customers and distributors not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts    consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes   minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns   28      table of contents    persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale

shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions     we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business   we announced a restructuring plan in september 2015 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our restructuring plan including details regarding the plan announced in september 2015 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8    our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend   we rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position    our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties   some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property for example some of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties including through both proprietary and open source licenses these thirdparty software components may become obsolete  29      table of contents defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty software components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights    thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in the it industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services   thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp inc and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us   further our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving our company in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp inc levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain  30      table of contents   the allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise company hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position   in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc the intellectual property assets relevant to their businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp incs trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp inc in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation hp inc will no longer have ownership of intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets    our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly   the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following    the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances   the pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services business    some of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our services business   31      table of contents    if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies     failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations   our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could suffer    hewlettpackard companys stock price has historically fluctuated and our stock price may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hp incs stock difficult to predict   our stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are    speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general   the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors   quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or our financial outlook and variations between actual and estimated financial results   announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by our competitors and other companies in the it industry   32      table of contents    developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and   the timing and amount of our share repurchases    general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources    failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets   our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies fitch ratings moodys investor service and standard amp poors rating services downgraded hewlettpackard companys ratings in the past past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets    we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations   in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations    unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance   we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of  33      table of contents new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performance    in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us   in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations    system security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price   experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems including bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions   we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data  34      table of contents about us our clients or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant   portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price    terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price   terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars    our business is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations   we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example we are subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed  35      table of contents retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict    some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt   we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp inc deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions    authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock   limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers    specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings   requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and   controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors    these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or our management as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock   any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp inc could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock    risks related to the separation    the separation of hewlettpackard company into two independent publiclytraded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits   on november 1 2015 we completed the separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses from its personal systems and printing businesses the process of completing the separation has involved significant costs and expenses uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships or cause them to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects   we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as an independent publiclytraded company we are a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect its business financial condition and results of operations  36      table of contents   the separation could result in substantial tax liability   we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that for us federal income tax purposes the separation qualified for both the company and our stockholders as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368d1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgement but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge notwithstanding the foregoing we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax expenses resulting from the separation in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separation which may be material if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor hewlett packard enterprise could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities    hewlett packard enterprise or hp inc may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation   in connection with the separation hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc entered into several agreements including among others a transition services agreement a separation and distribution agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a real estate matters agreement a commercial agreement and an it service agreement the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the separation the separation and distribution agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship between hewlett packard enterprise and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use incorporation and bundling in oem products and services resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities the it service agreement provides for the performance by one of hewlett packard enterprises subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and it infrastructure services for us we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if hewlett packard enterprise is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

separation transaction   on november 1 2015 the distribution date we completed the separation of hewlett packard enterprise hewlettpackard companys former enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses the separation in connection with the separation hewlettpackard company changed its name to hp inc   on november 1 2015 each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on october 21 2015 the record date received one share of hewlett packard enterprise common stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the record date we distributed a total of approximately 18 billion shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock to our stockholders   hewlett packard enterprise is now an independent public company trading on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol hpe after the separation we do not beneficially own any shares of hewlett packard enterprise common stock  43      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   the process of completing the separation was highly complex and involved significant costs and expenses accordingly we incurred separation costs and foreign tax expenses associated with separating into two companies in fiscal 2015 we recorded nonrecurring separation costs and net foreign tax expenses of 16 billion which were primarily related to thirdparty consulting contractor fees and other incremental costs directly associated with the separation process we expect total separation charges and net foreign tax expenses to be approximately 180 million in fiscal 2016 additionally the separation into two independent companies is expected to result in total dissynergies of approximately 400 million to 450 million annually which costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance legal it real estate and human resources such dissynergies are expected to be divided approximately equally between hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise   we recorded a deferred tax asset on these costs and expenses as they were incurred through fiscal 2015 we expect a portion of these deferred tax assets associated with separation costs and expenses will be eliminated given that some will be nondeductible at the time the separation is executed furthermore we concluded on the legal form of the separation and in may 2015 announced that hewlett packard enterprise will be the spinnee company in the united states us accordingly we implemented certain internal reorganizations of and transactions among our whollyowned subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the legal form of separation as a result we recognized gross incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities of approximately 300 million and foreign tax credits of approximately 100 million in fiscal 2015 with additional tax credit amounts expected over several years as of october 31 2015 we also expect separationrelated capital expenditures of approximately 30 million in fiscal 2016   in connection with the separation we and hewlett packard enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties going forward including among others a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a transition service agreement a real estate matters agreement a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we transferred substantially all of the assets liabilities and operations of enterprise technology infrastructure software services and financing businesses to hewlett

consolidated net revenue declined 73 decreased 21 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the leading contributors to the net revenue decline were unfavorable currency impacts across all major segments key account runoff and soft demand in infrastructure technology outsourcing ito in es lower desktop sales in personal systems and lower sales of printers and supplies partially offsetting these declines was growth within the eg segment from sales of iss servers gross margin was 240 248 billion and 239 266 billion for fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the 01 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in es partially offsetting the gross margin increase was the impact from a higher mix of iss products in eg competitive pricing pressures in printing and the impact from the sale of intellectual property ip in the prioryear period we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio hps operating margin decreased by 11 percentage points in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014

approximately 22 billion from the october 31 2014 balance of 155 billion the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the following factors cash received from operating cash flows of 65 billion and cash received for net issuances and repayments of debt of 50 billion partially offset by investments in property plant and equipment and business acquisitions net of divestitures of 32 billion and 24 billion respectively cash utilization for share repurchases of common stock of 29 billion and dividend payments to stockholders of 12 billion   we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloudbased offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution   the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below     in personal systems we are witnessing soft demand in the personal computer pc market as customers hold onto their pcs longer thereby extending pc refresh cycles demand for pcs is being impacted by weaker macroeconomic conditions and currency devaluations in certain asian and european markets additionally industry wide pc channels in some regions are working through excess channel inventory which is impacting sell in as such we see continued market headwinds for the next several quarters however we are optimistic and see opportunity in the market long term given our strength in commercial and the launch of windows 10 combined with intels skylake processor family transition which may represent a catalyst for demand through introduction of breakthrough form factors in personal systems we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multioperating systems multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes additionally hp is investing significantly in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks detachable notebooks and commercial tablets in order to meet customer preference for mobile thinner and lighter devices    in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets we are also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment due to aggressive pricing from our japanese competitors given the weakness of the japanese yen to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers in the consumer market our ink in the office products are driving unit volume due to our officejet pro product lines the ink in the office   46      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued    initiative also targets shifting ink into smbs through our officejet pro x printers which leverage our pagewide array technology in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offers a positive annuity of toner and ink and accelerating growth in graphics we are accomplishing this in several growth areas in multifunction and enterprise ink printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand in managed print services which presents a strong aftermarket supplies opportunity and in graphics with product innovation such as our indigo product line we plan to continue this focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to more valueadded units and expanding our innovative ink laser and graphics programs     in eg we are experiencing challenges due to multiple market trends including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment in addition demand for our business critical systems bcs products continues to weaken as has the overall market for unix products the effect of lower bcs and traditional storage revenue along with a higher mix of iss density optimized server products and midrange converged storage solutions is impacting support attach opportunities in technology services ts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and gotomarket execution challenges while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking storage blade servers and wireless networking   in es we are facing challenges including managing the revenue runoff from several large contracts pressured public sector spending a competitive pricing environment and market pressures from a mixed economic recovery in europe the middle east and africa emea we are also experiencing commoditization in the it infrastructure services market that is placing pressure on traditional ito pricing and cost structures there is also an industrywide shift to highly automated assetlight delivery of it infrastructure and applications leading to headcount consolidation to be successful in addressing these challenges we must execute on the es multiyear turnaround plan which includes a cost reduction initiative to align our costs to our revenue trajectory a focus on new logo wins and strategic enterprise services ses and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability contracting practices and pricing   in software we are facing challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud big data and security    to address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities  47      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference    critical accounting policies and estimates    general   the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows   a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements    revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance   we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements   we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with  48      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract   we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement   we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive   for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale   for the various software products we sell eg big data analytics and applications application delivery management enterprise security and it operations management we assess whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable   we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract customer support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided  49      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  on a whenandifavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered   for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements we consider the rights provided to the customer eg whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software in determining whether the arrangement includes the sale of a software license in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied   we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method   outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales    warranty   we accrue the estimated

actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that

description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference    retirement and postretirement benefits   our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as result of interim remeasurement   our major assumptions vary

the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year   we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse   we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located   our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2026 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate   we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 105 other

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference    inventory   we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues    business combinations   we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including inprocess research and development iprampd liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date iprampd is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when the iprampd project is complete it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life if an iprampd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to the consolidated statement of earnings in the period it is abandoned the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill   when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available    goodwill   we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units goodwill is tested for impairment at the  53

units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 2 except for es which includes two reporting units mphasis limited and the remainder of es   in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value   in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units   estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit   if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss   our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 19 to approximately 2600 of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 19  54                 table of contents   hp inc and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 7 to approximately 2400 of the carrying amounts with the software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 7 the fair value of the software reporting unit is estimated using equal weighting of both the income and market approaches our software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the software reporting unit the fair value of the software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publiclytraded companies changes in managements business strategy or significant and sustained declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment    intangible assets   we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach    fair value of derivative instruments   we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2015 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 526 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 11 billion and 05 billion respectively as of october 31 2015   fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value

employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the

exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below   actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure     foreign currency exchange rate risk    we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 79 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2015 were the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone   we use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 72 million and 62 million at october 31 2015 and october 31 2014 respectively    interest rate risk   we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables   we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense  83      table of contents the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial   in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2015 and 2014 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2015 and 2014 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 119 million at october 31 2015 and 80 million at october 31 2014  84

methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value there have been no changes in the methodologies used during the reporting period   investments in publiclytraded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded for corporate government and assetbacked debt securities fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate and government debt securities traded on active exchanges fair value is based on observable quoted prices the valuation of alternative investments such as limited partnerships and joint ventures may require significant management judgment for alternative investments valuation is based on net asset value nav as reported by the asset manager and adjusted for cash flows if necessary in making such an assessment a variety of factors  122      table of contents  hp inc and subsidiaries   notes to consolidated financial

global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business as part of its risk management strategy hp uses derivative instruments primarily forward contracts interest rate swaps total return swaps and at times option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency interest rate and to a lesser extent equity exposures hps objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities hp does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes hp may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedges additionally for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments hp categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives hp recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets hp classifies cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the consolidated statements of cash flows   as a result of its use of derivative instruments hp is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations to mitigate counterparty credit risk hp has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors and hp maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institutions credit rating and other factors hps established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties master netting agreements further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting hp to net amounts due from hp to counterparty against amounts due to hp from the same counterparty under certain conditions   to further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties hp has collateral security agreements that allow hp to hold collateral from or require hp to post collateral to counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of hp and its counterparties if hps or the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified credit rating either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives net liability  153      table of contents  hp inc and

derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was 173 million and 38 million at october 31 2015 and 2014 respectively all of which were fully collateralized within two business days   under hps derivative contracts the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting hp that results in the surviving entity being

principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts alternatively hp may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial   when investing in fixedrate instruments hp may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges   for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges hp recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item in interest and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings in the period of change     cash flow hedges    hp uses forward contracts and at times option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar hps foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months however hedges related to longer term procurement arrangements extend several years and forward contracts associated with salestype and directfinancing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term which typically range from two to five years   for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges hp initially records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings hp reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same

offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item in interest and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings in the period of change     hedge effectiveness    for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges hp measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative for foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges hp measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item both of which are based on forward rates hp recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge in the consolidated statements of earnings in the same period in which
