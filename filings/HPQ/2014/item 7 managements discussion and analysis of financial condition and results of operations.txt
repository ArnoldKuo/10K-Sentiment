restructuring charges and acquisitionrelated charges 2nm represents not meaningful    hp net revenue declined 08 decreased 04 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the leading contributors to the hp net revenue decline were key account runoff in es and lower printing supplies volume partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in personal systems from commercial personal computers pcs which experienced growth across all product categories along with growth in consumer notebooks hps gross margin increased by 08 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in es and favorable currency impacts from the japanese yen and continued cost structure improvements in printing we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio hps operating margin was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the gross margin increase improved business performance primarily in printing es and personal systems and lower intangible asset amortization offset by higher restructuring charges investments in research and development rampd and higher selling general and administrative sgampa expenses the increase in sgampa expenses was partially offset by gains from sales of real estate   our business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations generating 123 billion in fiscal 2014 additionally we invested 30 billion in property plant and equipment net of proceeds from sales repurchased 27 billion of common stock and paid dividends of 12 billion to stockholders as of october 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents and short and longterm investments were 155 billion representing an increase of approximately 30 billion from october 31 2013   we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and  44      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below     in personal systems we have been negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility products which has reduced the demand for pcs particularly consumer notebooks if benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize we will continue to be negatively impacted by this trend however the pace of the market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization and hp is gaining market share in personal systems we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to multios multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes in fiscal 2014 personal systems experienced revenue growth in commercial pcs with growth across all product categories particularly notebooks along with growth in consumer notebooks the increase in demand was due in part to customers migrating from the windows xp operating system benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle and new product introductions   in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets as well as an overall competitive pricing environment to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers in fiscal 2014 printing experienced a revenue decline and an increase in operating profit as we continued our print strategies with a focus on driving high value printer unit placements in the consumer market our ink in the office products are driving unit volume due to demand for our officejet pro product lines particularly our officejet pro x printers which leverage our pagewide array technology the ink in the office initiative targets shifting ink into smbs more profitably in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offer a positive annuity of toner we are accomplishing this in two growth areas in multifunction printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand and in managed print services which presents a strong aftermarket supplies opportunity we plan to continue this focus on replenishing the installed base with valueadded units and expanding our innovative ink and laser programs   in eg we are experiencing revenue challenges due to multiple market trends including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment in addition demand for our business critical systems bcs products continues to weaken along with the overall market for unix products and the effect of lower bcs revenue is impacting technology services ts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and gotomarket execution challenges and continue to pursue new product innovation in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking storage blade servers and wireless networking in fiscal 2014 eg experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit due to the previously mentioned challenging market environment in particular weak market demand in bcs and market shifts impacting storage elsewhere in eg we experienced areas of   45      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and

uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   critical accounting policies and estimates   general   the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows  46      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured as well as other revenue recognition principles including industry specific revenue recognition guidance   we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements   we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract   we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical  47      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement   we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive   for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale   for the various software products we sell eg operating system software network enabling software it and management software and enterprise security software we assess whether the software products were sold standalone or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable   we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on an ifandwhenavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered   for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied in hosting arrangements that include software licenses we consider the rights provided to the customer eg ownership of a license contract termination provisions and feasibility of the customer to operate the software in determining when to recognize revenue for the licenses   we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such  48      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method   outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales   warranty   we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 27 and 29 of annual net product revenue respectively   restructuring   we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference   retirement and postretirement benefits   our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan as a result of a historical study of the us plans in fiscal 2014 hp adopted a new mortality rate table which incorporated newly released mortality rates published by the society of actuaries this resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately 870 million for the us defined benefit plans the  49      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year   our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2014                      change in percentage points    change in net periodic benefit cost in millions       assumptions                  discount rate     25     83      expected increase in compensation levels     25      20      expected longterm return on plan assets     25     68        taxes on earnings   we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year   we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse   we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located  50      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate   we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 105 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference   inventory   we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues   goodwill   we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units   goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we changed our reporting units in connection with continued operational synergies and interdependencies between the enterprise servers storage and networking reporting unit and the ts reporting unit within the eg segment we combined these reporting units to create the eg reporting unit as of october 31 2014 our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified  51      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  in note 2 except for es which includes two reporting units mphasis limited and the remainder of es   in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value   in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units   estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit   if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss   our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 18 to approximately 12000 of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 18  52                  table of contents   hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 6 to approximately 10000 of the carrying amounts with the software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 6 the fair value of the software reporting unit is estimated using a weighting of both the income and market approaches our software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the software reporting unit the fair value of the software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publiclytraded companies changes in managements business strategy or significant declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment   intangible assets   we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach   fair value of derivative instruments   we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2014 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 547 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 980 million and 405 million respectively as of october 31 2014   fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices  53      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and

liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the

interest and other net expense increased by 7 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was due primarily to higher currency transaction losses partially offset by lower interest expense from a lower average debt balance   interest and other net expense decreased by 255 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven primarily by lower currency transaction losses coupled with lower interest expense

generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore netherlands china and ireland we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the us and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings   in addition to the above factors the effective
