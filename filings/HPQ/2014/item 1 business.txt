hp labs and certain cloudrelated business incubation projects among others   sales marketing and distribution   we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including    retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores    resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups   distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers   original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution   independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products   systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and   advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services    the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate   manufacturing and materials   we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors  9                  table of contents   we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers   we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   international   our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth   a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 65 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2014 came from outside the united states us   for a discussion of risks attendant to hps international operations see risk factorsdue to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference  10      table of contents  research and development   innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences   hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment   expenditures for research and development were 34 billion in fiscal 2014 31 billion in fiscal 2013 and 34 billion in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position   for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factorsif we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   patents   our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2014 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 34000 patents which represents a decrease over the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 this decrease is attributable in part to the sale of a portfolio of mobile computing intellectual property ip in january 2014   patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments   in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license ip from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties   for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see risk factorsour revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the ip rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their ip rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   backlog   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business  11      table of contents  seasonality   general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   competition   we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings   the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive   we have a

enterprise securityrisk intelligence solutions that compete with products from emc ibm cisco and intel as customers are becoming increasingly comfortable with newer delivery mechanisms such as saas we are facing competition from smaller less traditional competitors particularly for customers with smaller it organizations our differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage   hp financial services in our financing solution business our competitors are captive financing companies mainly ibm global financing as well as banks

various federal state local and foreign laws concerning the environment including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances

use including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products some of our products also are or

future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use and their energy efficiency including requirements relating to climate change we are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods including computers and printers financially responsible for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products sometimes referred to as product takeback legislation in the event our products become noncompliant with these laws our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions including fines   our operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal state local and foreign laws regulations and international treaties relating to climate change as these laws regulations treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines however we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to
