declined 67 decreased 55 on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to revenue declines of approximately 10 8 5 and 3 in our personal systems es eg and printing segments respectively these revenue declines reflect a series of revenue growth challenges that impacted each of our segments to varying degrees the primary challenges included a significant contraction in the overall pc market which impacted personal systems weak public sector spending and enterprise it demand particularly in europe which impacted the es and eg segments competitive pricing pressures in the enterprise and pc markets which impacted both the eg and personal systems segments and unfavorable currency impacts and volume declines in supplies which impacted the printing segment gross margin decreased by 01 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the gross margin decline was due primarily to competitive pricing environments in the markets for eg and personal systems products and decreased revenue and contractual price declines for es partially offsetting these negative impacts was a gross margin increase in printing due primarily to improvements in toner and higher average selling prices for highervalue consumer printers operating margin increased by 156 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to the absence of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2013 additionally total research and development rampd and selling general and administrative sgampa expenses decreased 29 due primarily to rampd activity streamlining in eg particularly in business critical systems bcs and cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts that impacted all expense categories  41      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   our business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations generating 116 billion in fiscal 2013 during the year we repaid 57 billion of debt returned 11 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 15 billion worth of common stock in addition we purchased 32 billion in capital assets we ended fiscal 2013 with an investment portfolio of 125 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments which was an increase of approximately 800 million from the end of fiscal 2012   we entered fiscal 2013 having experienced a multiquarter decline in revenue and operating margins that decline in financial performance reflected a series of challenges that were facing our business some of those challenges related to structural and execution issues such as aligning costs to our revenue trajectory addressing the need to rationalize our rampd investments and reinvest in it systems and rebuilding our channel partner relationships other challenges related to dynamic market trends such as the growth of mobility the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure the shift to softwareasaservice saas the transition towards cloud computing and aggressive pricing conditions we also confronted a series of significant macroeconomic challenges in fiscal 2013 such as a shift in consumer spending weak demand in the smb and enterprise sectors in europe and declining growth in some emerging markets   during fiscal 2013 we continued to address these challenges by driving innovation across the company improving operations aligning our cost structure and rebuilding our balance sheet as a result of these efforts revenue declines have begun to moderate as we reap the early benefits of our investments in product innovation as decreasing costs driven by our restructuring efforts have begun to align to our revenue trajectory as our enterprise services business has begun to become more predictable and as our business performance has begun to improve in our printing business due to our focus on key initiatives such as ink in the office managed print services and ink advantage in addition we made investments targeted at our channel partner relationships through improvements in sales force and channel partner deal pricing tools and reporting infrastructure our strong cash flows from operations in fiscal 2013 also have allowed us to further reduce our debt   as we enter fiscal 2014 we continue to experience challenges that represent trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in saas business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in europe the middle east and africa emea china and other highgrowth markets a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below    in personal systems we continue to be negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility which has reduced the demand for consumer and notebook products if benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize we will continue to be negatively impacted by this trend personal systems is also being impacted by consumer demand weakness particularly in emea and a competitive pricing environment   42      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued    in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility weak consumer demand weak demand in emea and a competitive pricing environment to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers  in eg we are experiencing revenue declines due to multiple market trends and a highly competitive pricing environment including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products and the transition to cloud computing in addition the market for our bcs products continues to weaken as the overall market for unix products contracts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model and gotomarket execution challenges including improved channel execution and continue to pursue new product innovation such as hp moonshot servers 3par storage and the hp cloudsystem and in the areas of softwaredefined networking blade servers and wireless networking   in es we are facing market and macroeconomic pressures a competitive pricing environment internal execution challenges and weak public sector spending to be successful in addressing these challenges we must execute on our multiyear turnaround plan which includes a cost reduction initiative to align our costs to our revenue trajectory and initiatives targeted at improved execution in the areas of sales performance and accountability contracting practices and pricing   in software we are facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges to be successful in addressing these challenges we must improve our gotomarket execution with integrated customer solutions more aligned to customer demand and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on the important market opportunities in the areas of cloud big data security and mobility    to address these challenges we need to continue to pursue new product innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand industry trends and with the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities   for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   critical accounting policies and estimates   general   the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are  43      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows   the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue applying the basic revenue recognition criteria ie when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured along with other revenue recognition principles including industry specific revenue recognition guidance we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation is required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among the elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting only when the delivered elements have standalone value uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customernegotiated refund or return rights or other contingencies present for the delivered elements for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract   we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on the vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is  44      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in arrangements with multiple elements allocation of the transaction price is determined at inception of the arrangement based on each unit of accountings relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement   for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale   we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive   outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event if the service is provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are uneven we generally recognize revenue on a straightline basis over the contract term losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period in which such contractual losses become probable and estimable   we recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for certain design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of a fixedprice contract as a result of revisions to cost estimates and overall contract losses where applicable we record such changes in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method   for the various software products we sell eg operating system software network enabling software information technology and management software and enterprise security software we assess whether the associated software products were sold stand alone or with the hardware products if the software sold with the hardware product is morethanincidental and is essential to the functionality of the hardware we apply the software accounting guidance we recognize revenue from the sale of  45      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license for software products within the scope of the software accounting guidance we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements exists such as postcontract support and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue generated from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates on an ifandwhenavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered for software hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in software hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold the associated software revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual licenses or term licenses are sold subject to the above guidance in such software hosting arrangements we consider the rights provided to the customer eg ownership of a license contract termination provisions and feasibility of the customer to operate the software in determining how to account for the license fees in saas arrangements where software licenses are not sold the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription arrangement   warranty provision   we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty provision and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 29 and 31 of annual net product revenue respectively   business combinations   we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill   when determining the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to expected future cash flows which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins attrition rates future changes in technology and brand awareness loyalty and position and discount rates fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available  46      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   goodwill   we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units   goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level except for eg and es our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference eg includes two reporting units which are enterprise servers storage and networking essn and technology services ts es also consists of two reporting units which are mphasis limited and the remainder of es in fiscal 2013 we made two changes to our reporting units we identified mphasis limited as a reporting unit apart from the remainder of es and in connection with integration activities we combined the autonomy reporting unit with the legacy hp software business reporting unit   in the first step of the impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach up to 50 of the concluded reporting unit fair value depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we used the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value   in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair values to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could reduce the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units   determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount for each reporting unit  47                  table of contents   hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss   our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 14 to approximately 1200 of carrying amounts the software and essn reporting units have the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 31 and 14 respectively in estimating the fair value of our reporting units we have taken into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of august 1 2013 the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit   in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 2 to approximately 1000 of the carrying amounts this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in the software and essn reporting units having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 18 and 2 respectively we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in managements business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment  intangible assets  we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of the finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach   restructuring   we have engaged in restructuring actions which

realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that

actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference   stockbased compensation   our stockbased compensation program primarily consists of awards of restricted stock as well as stock options and to a lesser extent other award types the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to hps stock price on the date of grant for stock options determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating fair value requires the use of assumptions including the expected term of the option and the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the option we utilize the blackscholesmerton option pricing formula to value servicebased stock options we determine the expected term using our historical exercise and postvesting termination patterns we determine the expected stock price volatility using implied volatility from options traded on hps stock we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on hps stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility   the amount of compensation recognized for awards of restricted stock and options is adjusted for an assumed level of forfeiture due to the presence of service or performance vesting conditions and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award these compensation costs are determined at the aggregate grant level for servicebased awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance andor market conditions to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates we record an adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such adjustments could materially affect our operating results   for a further discussion on stockbased compensation refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference   taxes on earnings   we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent fiscal year we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year for us federal and state purposes respectively   we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize   we have considered future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located  49      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate   we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 80 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions which may not be fully sustained accordingly our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference   allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable   we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we state our account receivables balance at net realizable value we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or a deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position if the customers circumstances change we would adjust our estimate of the net realizable value of the receivables in addition we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the use of thirdparty credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors the financial condition of customers the length of time receivables are past due trends in overall weightedaverage risk rating of the total portfolio macroeconomic conditions information derived from competitive benchmarking significant onetime events and historical experience the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable   the annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 004 of net revenue over the last three fiscal years using our thirdparty credit risk model at october 31 2013 a 50basispoint deterioration in the weightedaverage default probabilities of our significant customers would have increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by 48 million  50      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements

value every reporting period at october 31 2013 derivative assets and liabilities were 452 million and 656 million respectively   fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset or liability being valued hp generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of its derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability hp uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices

by reference   retirement and postretirement benefits   our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates future compensation growth rates and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period the future compensation growth rate assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future outlook the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan

weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2013 changes in the weightedaverage assumptions would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost   a decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 65 million  a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 75 million and  an increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation growth rate would have increased our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 18 million    loss contingencies   we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations

the decline in personal systems revenue was driven by an 8 decline in unit volume along with a 3 decline in average selling prices asps the unit volume decrease was led by declines in consumer and notebook products as a result of the market shift to tablet products the decline in asps was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment net revenue for consumer clients decreased 19 while net

the net revenue increase in other was related to increased sales of extended warranties and thirdparty branded options and sales of our newly introduced consumer tablets   personal systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 17 percentage points in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven by a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue the decline in gross margin was due to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures these unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower

payable dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90day average cost of goods sold our accounts payable balance was 140 billion as of october 31 2013   our working capital requirements depend on effectively managing the cash conversion cycle which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of inventory to the collection of cash from our customers the cash conversion cycle is the sum of dso and dos less dpo   the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2013 decreased by 4 days compared to fiscal 2012 and is below what we expect to be a longterm sustainable rate the dso remained flat year over year the decrease in dos was due to lower inventory balances relative to the rate of decline in cost of goods sold in most segments as of october 31 2013 the increase in dpo was primarily due to favorable payment term changes partially offset by unfavorable purchasing linearity   the cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2012 decreased by five days compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in dso was due primarily to improved collections an increase in cash discounts and a decline in extended payment terms additionally our dso benefited from the currentperiod dso calculation containing a full quarter of revenue from our autonomy acquisition versus the approximately one month of revenue that was included in the priorperiod dso calculation these favorable impacts to  69      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements

credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts in addition any further downgrade in our credit ratings by any of the rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner and depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position we expect to rely on alternative sources of funding including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other

outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our global notes to variable interest rates the impact of these interest rate swaps was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 4in fiscal 2014 we expect to contribute approximately 617 million to our nonus pension plans and approximately 33 million to cover benefit payments to us nonqualified plan participants we expect to pay approximately 109 million to cover benefit claims for our postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that they meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes see note 15 to the consolidated financial   72      table of

tax positions these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 104 million expected to be made within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash payments to the tax authorities as a result of future settlements these obligations are not included in the table see note
