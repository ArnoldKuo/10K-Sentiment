   the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k   because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods   if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited   we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states western and northern europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business   in may 2012 we announced a companywide restructuring plan expected to be implemented through the end of fiscal 2014 the restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and nonvoluntary workforce reductions significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees in addition our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected   competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support  17      table of contents security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and prospects could be harmed   we have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers   companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected   we face aggressive price competition for our products and services and as a result we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures   because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects   even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business   if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer   our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changing and hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute  18      table of contents on this strategy we need to continue evolving our focus towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers and to continue to invest and expand into cloud computing security big data and mobility any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial results   the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions in addition after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position   in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or the employees of those contractors or subcontractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations   economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses   our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa emea region china and other highgrowth markets the us federal government spending cuts that went into effect on march 1 2013 may further reduce demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic  19      table of contents weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses   we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliersand our suppliers from their suppliersdue to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit   economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses   the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable   our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period  20      table of contents  if we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions our revenue gross margins and profitability may suffer   many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance to maintain our competitive position in these markets we must successfully develop and introduce new products and services among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing variations in costs delays in customer purchases or reductions in the price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and challenges of effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand risks associated with new products meeting customer qualifications and customer evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings our revenue and gross margins may decline and our profitability may be harmed   our revenue and gross margin also may suffer as a result of the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction furthermore sales of our new products and services may replace sales or result in discounting of some of our current offerings offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction there also may be overlaps in our current products and services and portfolios we have acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must manage in addition it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue margin and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates given the competitive nature of our industry if any of these risks materializes future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer   if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margins and profitability could suffer   we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below    our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken     our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken    21      table of contents   our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors     we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively     we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly   our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below    shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or services offerings which could result in further costs and delays   oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take   22      table of contents   advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin    contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectibility risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition   contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws   single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and cash flows   23      table of contents  business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses   our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain   our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable   in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected   we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control  24      table of contents  due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition   sales outside the united states make up approximately 64 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including   ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers  trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products   local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms   managing a geographically dispersed workforce  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  differing technology standards or customer requirements  import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions  difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and  fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments    the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture   currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and  25      table of contents services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition   in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa for example as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements the german public prosecutors office the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission have been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion in addition the us enforcement authorities as well as the polish central anticorruption bureau are conducting investigations into potential fcpa violations by a former employee of an hp subsidiary in connection with certain publicsector transactions in poland and the us enforcement authorities are conducting investigations into certain other publicsector transactions in russia poland the commonwealth of independent states and mexico among other countries although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation   any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected   as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results   managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations  we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers or other thirdparties   business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans  any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable   26                       table of contents    our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives   our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies  the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated  in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders  we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition  our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate  an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter  business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation   if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage    we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example in our third fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our former services segment and a 12 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the compaq trade name acquired in 2002 in addition in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges   integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include   combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise  convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations   27      table of contents   in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts    consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns   persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs  coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with thirdparties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures   achieving savings from supply chain integration and  managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions    while we do not currently plan to divest any of our major businesses we do regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results   our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if thirdparties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights   we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position   because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties  28      table of contents we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights   thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and its customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us   finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain   our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly   the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following   the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for   29      table of contents   those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances    the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business  some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business  some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the cash flows of our it services business   if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our profitably could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies    failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations   our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their  30      table of contents formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue   hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict   hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are   speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or investment transactions future stock price performance board of directors executive team our competitors or our industry in general  the announcement of new planned or contemplated products services technological innovations acquisitions divestitures or other significant transactions by hp or its competitors  quarterly increases or decreases in revenue gross margin earnings or cash flows changes in estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by hp and variations between actual and estimated financial results  announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by hps competitors and other companies in the it industry   developments relating to pending investigations claims and disputes and   the timing and amount of share repurchases by hp    general or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to hps performance also may affect the price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources   failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets   our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies two of those rating agencies moodys investors service and standard amp poors ratings services downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012 and a third rating agency fitch ratings downgraded our ratings twice during  31      table of contents that fiscal year in addition moodys investors service downgraded our ratings again in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service these downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets   we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations   in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations   unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability   we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability   in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us   in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified  32      table of contents executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting sharebased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations further changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations   system security risks data protection breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price   experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from thirdparties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions   we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business in addition our outsourcing services business routinely processes stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients including sensitive and personally identifiable information breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our clients or customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business we also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other it solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant   portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could  33      table of contents cause business disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price   terrorist acts conflicts wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price   terrorist acts conflicts or wars wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business our employees facilities partners suppliers distributors resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties in addition as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events if they occur they could result in a decrease in demand for our products make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts conflicts and wars   unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations   we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites the content of our products and the recycling treatment and disposal of our products including batteries in particular we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products their safe use the energy consumption associated with those products climate change laws and regulations and product takeback legislation if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become noncompliant with environmental laws we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions thirdparty property damage personal injury claims and cleanup costs further liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis and without any finding of noncompliance or fault the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict   some antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt   we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors these include provisions   authorizing blank check preferred stock which we could issue with voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock  limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers   34      table of contents   specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and  controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election appointment and removal of our directors    these provisions alone or together could deter or delay hostile takeovers proxy contests and changes in control or management of hp as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock   any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of hp stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for hp stock
