    in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of hp accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below   actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure    foreign currency exchange rate risk    we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2013 were the euro the japanese yen chinese yuan renminbi and the british pound for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone   we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2013 and 2012 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2013 and 2012 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 80 million and 71 million at october 31 2013 and october 31 2012 respectively   interest rate risk   we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables   we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we then often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk  74      table of contents exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial   in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2013 and 2012 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2013 and 2012 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 95 million at october 31 2013 and 121 million at october 31 2012  75                   table of contents
