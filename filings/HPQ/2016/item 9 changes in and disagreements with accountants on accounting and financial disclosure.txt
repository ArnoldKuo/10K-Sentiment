internet storesresellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groupsdistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers andsystem integrators and other advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and servicesthe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our key business segments manage the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment 5table of contentswhere appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers we typically manage direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriatemanufacturing and materialswe utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendorswe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customerswe purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any nonrenewal or limitation or reduction of the scope of our agreement with canon could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreementwe are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencelike other participants in the information technology it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencesustainability also plays a role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products some customer segments expect that our products are made in an ethical and sustainable manner which we strive to ensure through our sustainability programs we have committed to building an efficient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosure for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein internationalour products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this

market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencepatentsour general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2016 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 18000 patentspatents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segmentsin addition to developing our patent portfolio we license intellectual property ip from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third partiesfor a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see risk factorsour financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencebacklogwe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall businessseasonalitygeneral economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference7table of contentscompetitionwe encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete on the basis

competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be

of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periodsrisks related to our businessif we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limitedwe are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the declines in the pc market and home printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial conditionin addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in emerging markets and europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays 11table of contentsin the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given the markets in which we compete the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our businesswe operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performancewe encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments we compete on the basis of our technology innovation performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support and security if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully our results of operations and business prospects could be harmedwe have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their productscompanies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affectedwe face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressuresindustry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliersbecause our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospectseven if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies businessif we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may sufferour strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition12table of contentsthe process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics develop and introduce 3d printers and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or acquire and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnelour industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomicalafter we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive positionif we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may sufferin the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operationswe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our resultscurrencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate in addition the united kingdoms june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as brexit caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states13table of contentsfrom time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of salesrecent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performanceour business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services brexit and the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdoms exit from the european union has also begun to negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenseswe also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliersand our suppliers from their suppliersdue to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain crediteconomic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expensesthe net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictableour net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our net revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of 14table of contentsvariability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to periodif we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could sufferwe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitabilityour financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weakenour inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectivelyour operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers each of which is described below15table of contentscomponent shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delaysexcess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performancecontractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial conditioncontingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local lawssinglesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we obtain from canon alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any 16table of contentsunilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performancebusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expensesour worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertainour uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictableour quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affectedwe experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our controldue to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performancesales outside the united states made up approximately 63 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2016 in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors includingongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from brexitlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers the imposition by governments of additional taxes tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countriestrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production shipping pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors17table of contentslocal labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oemsmanaging a geographically dispersed workforcechanges or uncertainty in the international national or local regulatory and legal environmentsdiffering technology standards or customer requirementsimport export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or

tax laws andfluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipmentsthe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacturein many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputationany failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospectsas part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial resultsmanaging business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operationswe may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers other thirdparties or market trendscertain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by hewlettpackard company resulted and in the future any such transactions by us may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plansany increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitableour ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representativesthe pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummatedin order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders18table of contentswe may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial conditionour effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rateany announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarterbusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operationsif we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantagewe have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset chargesas part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing for example our acquisition of samsungs printer business is subject to regulatory review in numerous jurisdictions including south korea and the european union as well as customary closing conditions dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial resultsintegrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospectsin order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration includesuccessfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertiseconvincing both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focuspersuading both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution effortsconsolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processesminimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns19table

proceduresachieving savings from supply chain integration andmanaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactionswe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our businesswe announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses dependwe rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive positionour products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third partiessome of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights20table of contentsthirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and servicesthird parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to usfurther our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertainthe allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive positionin connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hps trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation we no longer own intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product marketsour business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properlythe risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the followingthe success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstancesthe pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or 21table of contentsunanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services businesssome of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our services businessif we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographiesfailure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operationsour contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business in addition hewlettpackard company has in the past been and we may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial performance could sufferour

the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our

estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operationsin connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operationsunanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performancewe are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws in particular if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the united states future income tax expense may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results in addition various tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered that could significantly impact our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our financial performancein order to be

develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical development sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and equitybased compensation our equitybased incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such equitybased incentive awards does not materialize if our equitybased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equitybased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a

latin america canada and certain asian and european markets as such we anticipate continued market headwindsin printing we are experiencing the impact of demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets we are also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment and have yet to see evidence of a broad move for our japanese competitors to be less aggressive given the strength of the yen we obtain a number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreement we may also face challenges as a result of the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly known as brexit the outcome of brexit and its impact on our business cannot be known until the terms and 32hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedtiming of the united kingdoms exit are clearer until that time we may face various brexitrelated challenges that may include uncertainty in the markets volatility in exchange rates and weaker macroeconomic conditionsto address these challenges we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners in addition we need to continue to improve our operations with a particular focus on enhancing our endtoend processes and efficiencies we also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models align our sales incentives with our strategic goals improve channel execution strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus and develop and capitalize on market opportunities for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could impact our continuing operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a in this annual report on form 10kcritical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met including industryspecific revenue recognition guidance we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the delivery of the final deliverable if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract 33hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedwe establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority we evaluate tpe of selling price by reviewing largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts ratably over the contract period warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts labor and onsite services depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 22 and 25 of annual net revenue respectively restructuring and other charges we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements other charges include nonrecurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs such as information technology costs incurred in connection with the separation for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 4 restructuring and other charges to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference retirement and postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long34hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected longterm return on plan assets we update the expected longterm return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the longterm expected return has changed in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim remeasurement our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 5 retirement and postretirement benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis

we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are locatedour effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided united states federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the united states and the amounts we expect to distribute to the united states and provide the united 35hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedstates federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the united states further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states and our related future effective tax rate we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 7 taxes on earnings to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on the qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed in the first step of the impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions we base the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approachif the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step we measure the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment lossour annual goodwill impairment analysis performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting 36hp inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations continuedunits exceeded their respective carrying values as a result we concluded that the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary  fair value of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and at times options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of october 31 2016 the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was 179 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 325 million and 97 million respectively as of october 31 2016 fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments refer to note 10 fair value and note 11 financial instruments respectively to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters as discussed in note 15 litigation and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15 litigation and contingencies are not a meaningful indicator of hps potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2016 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statementsrecent accounting pronouncements for a summary of recent accounting

normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined belowactual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our

business in approximately 44 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2016 were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the british pound and the indian rupee for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alonewe use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedgewe have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2016 and 2015 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2016 and 2015 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 41 million and 54 million for continuing operations at october 31 2016 and october 31 2015 respectivelyinterest rate

transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap

incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns at the later of the date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered future market conditions and product transitions may require hp to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time

the incentive in instances when revenue is derived from sales of thirdparty vendor products or services hp records revenue on a gross basis when hp is a principal to the transaction and on a net basis

internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cyclesin most arrangements with multiple elements hp allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting at inception of

goodwill66table of contents hp inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuednote 1 overview and summary of significant accounting policies continuedhp reviews goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable hp can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or hp can directly perform the twostep impairment test based on the qualitative assessment if hp determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed in the first step of the impairment test hp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach hp estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows hp bases cash flow projections on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions hp bases the discount rate on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach hp estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit hp weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available hp estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approachin order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of hps reporting units hp compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization on an overall basis hp evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions hp reevaluates its reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting unitsif the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then hp performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step hp measures the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss debt and marketable equity securities investments debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered availableforsale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of applicable taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets realized gains and losses for availableforsale securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and included in interest and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings hp monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis when the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be otherthantemporary ie when hp does not intend to sell the debt securities and it is not more likely than not that hp will be required to sell the debt securities prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis hp records an impairment charge to interest and other net in the amount of the credit loss and the remaining amount if any is recorded in accumulated

investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments the majority of the plans investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets a number of the plans investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures and hp may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures the target asset allocation selected for each us plan reflects a riskreturn profile hp believes is appropriate relative to each plans liability structure and return goals hp conducts periodic assetliability studies for us plans in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plans forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs hp invests a portion of the us defined benefit plan assets and postretirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets outside the united states asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan as in the united states investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations in some countries local regulations may restrict asset allocations typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed hp reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific planbasis for expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers each countrys specific inflation outlook because hps investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market the expected returns are

products sold and the perproduct amounts of the levies which vary some european countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes while other european countries have phased out levies or are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment particularly with respect to sales to business users hp other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated alternative models of

means that hp amend certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet mfds sold in belgium from january 2005 to december 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher copying speed when the mfds are operated in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode in march 2010 hp filed a lawsuit against reprobel in the frenchspeaking chambers of the court of first instance of brussels seeking a declaratory judgment that no copyright levies are payable on sales of mfds in belgium or alternatively that copyright levies payable on such mfds must be assessed based on the copying speed when operated in the normal print mode set by default in the device on november 16 2012 the court issued a decision holding that belgium law is not in conformity with eu law in a number of respects and ordered that by november 2013 reprobel substantiate that the amounts claimed by reprobel are commensurate with the harm resulting from legitimate copying under the reprographic exception hp subsequently appealed that court decision to the courts of appeal in brussels seeking to confirm that the belgian law is not in conformity with eu law and that if belgian law is interpreted in a manner consistent with eu law no payments by hp are required or alternatively the payments already made by hp are sufficient to comply with its obligations under belgian law on october 23 2013 the court of appeal in brussels stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the cjeu relating to whether the belgian reprographic
