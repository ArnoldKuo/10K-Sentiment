directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners includingretailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet storesresellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groupsdistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers andsystem integrators and other advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and servicesthe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our key business segments manage the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment 5table of contentswhere appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers we typically manage direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriatemanufacturing and materialswe utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendorswe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customerswe purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any nonrenewal or limitation or reduction of the scope of our agreement with canon could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreementwe are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencelike other participants in the information technology it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencesustainability also plays a role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products some customer segments expect that our products are made in an ethical and sustainable manner which we strive to ensure through our sustainability programs we have committed to building an efficient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosure for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein internationalour products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth6table of contentsa summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 3 segment information to the consolidated

the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segmentsin addition to developing

financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencebacklogwe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall businessseasonalitygeneral economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour

effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under

limitedwe are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the declines in the pc market and home printing a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution for example we may fail to develop innovative products and services maintain the manufacturing quality of our products manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services any of which could adversely affect our business and financial conditionin addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in emerging markets and europe and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays 11table of

prospects could be harmedwe have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do and our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their productscompanies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our business and results of operations could be adversely affectedwe face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete or who can obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressuresindustry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate additionally our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliersbecause our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure apart from research and development expenses on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospectseven if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies businessif we cannot successfully execute our gotomarket strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market innovative products and services our business and financial performance may sufferour strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline to successfully execute this strategy we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition12table of contentsthe process of developing new hightechnology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share results of operations and financial condition for example to offset industry declines in some of our businesses we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers maintain our strong position in graphics develop and introduce 3d printers and execute on our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers we must make longterm investments develop or acquire and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding andor personnelour industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change even if we successfully develop new products and technologies future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and enduser requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones our competitors may also create products that replace ours as a result any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomicalafter we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products lifecycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive positionif we cannot continue to produce quality products and services our reputation business and financial performance may sufferin the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or their employees in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products and services that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue cash flows and profitability in addition after products are delivered quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty repair replacement and other costs adversely affecting our financial performance if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operationswe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely impact our resultscurrencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate in addition the united kingdoms june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as brexit caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound global economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states13table of contentsfrom time to time we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations in addition certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue financial condition and to a lesser extent our cost of salesrecent global regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performanceour business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted and may result in the future in decreased net revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa region china and certain other highgrowth markets ongoing us federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products and services brexit and the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdoms exit from the european union has also begun to negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that could continue for the foreseeable future economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenseswe also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliersand our suppliers from their suppliersdue to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain crediteconomic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expensesthe net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictableour net revenue gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our net revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in hardware and related services spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in net revenue in addition net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of 14table of contentsvariability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to periodif we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our business and financial performance could sufferwe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitabilityour financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness industry consolidation and market trends many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners net revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weakenour inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectivelyour operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services given the wide variety of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected furthermore certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers each of which is described below15table of contentscomponent shortages we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also our customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications accordingly our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings which could result in further costs and delaysexcess supply in order to secure components for our products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our business and financial performancecontractual terms as a result of binding longterm price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectability risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial conditioncontingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local lawssinglesource suppliers we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a singlesource supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we obtain from canon alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from singlesource suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such singlesource suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of our components the loss of a singlesource supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a singlesource supplier or any 16table of contentsunilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performancebusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expensesour worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters it system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertainour uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictableour quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affectedwe experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our controldue to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performancesales outside the united states made up approximately 63 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2016 in addition a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors includingongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from brexitlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers the imposition by governments of additional taxes tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countriestrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production shipping pricing and marketing of products including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors17table of contentslocal labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and oemsmanaging a geographically dispersed workforcechanges or uncertainty in the international national or local regulatory and legal environmentsdiffering technology standards or customer requirementsimport export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or

tax laws andfluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipmentsthe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacturein many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended the fcpa although we implement policies procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputationany failure by us to identify manage and complete acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospectsas part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial resultsmanaging business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operationswe may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers other thirdparties or market trendscertain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by hewlettpackard company resulted and in the future any such transactions by us may result in significant costs and expenses including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plansany increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitableour ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representativesthe pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummatedin order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders18table of contentswe may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial conditionour effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rateany announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarterbusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation which could impact our financial condition and results of operationsif we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantagewe have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset chargesas part of our business strategy we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing for example our acquisition of samsungs printer business is subject to regulatory review in numerous jurisdictions including south korea and the european union as well as customary closing conditions dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial resultsintegrating acquisitions may be difficult and timeconsuming any failure by us to integrate acquired companies products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results business and prospectsin order to pursue our strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees integration issues are often timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration includesuccessfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertiseconvincing both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focuspersuading both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution effortsconsolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processesminimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns19table

proceduresachieving savings from supply chain integration andmanaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactionswe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our businesswe announced a restructuring plan in october 2016 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs implementation of the restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring additionally as a result of our restructuring we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency during transitional periods reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees time and focus which may divert attention from operating and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about our october 2016 restructuring plan see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses dependwe rely upon patent copyright trademark trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property ip rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position for example our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies ip against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip may be successfully circumvented further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive positionour products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third partiessome of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms or such third parties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property thirdparty components may become obsolete defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses we must carefully monitor and manage our use of thirdparty components including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms additionally some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business including our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights20table of contentsthirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful thirdparty claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and servicesthird parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to usfurther our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertainthe allocation of intellectual property rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation could adversely impact our reputation our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive positionin connection with the separation hewlettpackard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the intellectual property assets relevant to their respective businesses the terms of the separation include crosslicenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the existing operations of both businesses for example through a joint brand holding structure both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlettpackard and hp branding respectively there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hps trademark rights against third parties that infringe them furthermore as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp in addition as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation we no longer own intellectual property allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement patent licensing and crosslicensing our ability to sell our products or services our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product marketsour business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properlythe risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the followingthe success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstancesthe pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or 21table of contentsunanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services businesssome of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could harm the financial performance of our services businessif we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our financial performance could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographiesfailure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operationsour contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance

appropriateness of our tax provision however we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective
