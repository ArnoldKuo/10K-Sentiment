directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners includingretailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet storesresellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groupsdistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers andsystem integrators and other advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and servicesthe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our key business segments manage the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment 5table of contentswhere appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers we typically manage direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriatemanufacturing and materialswe utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendorswe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customerswe purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption for instance we source laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon any nonrenewal or limitation or reduction of the scope of our agreement with canon could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products however we have a longstanding business relationship with canon and do not anticipate nonrenewal of this agreementwe are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide ramifications and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencelike other participants in the information technology it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supplies see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencesustainability also plays a role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products some customer segments expect that our products are made in an ethical and sustainable manner which we strive to ensure through our sustainability programs we have committed to building an efficient and sustainable supplier network and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations these actions together with our broader sustainability program help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations for example regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosure for more information on our sustainability goals programs and performance we refer you to our annual sustainability report available on our website which is not incorporated by reference herein internationalour products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth6table of contentsa summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 3 segment information to the consolidated

the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segmentsin addition to developing

financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend in item 1a which is incorporated herein by referencebacklogwe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall businessseasonalitygeneral economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour

effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under
