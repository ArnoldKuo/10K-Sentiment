in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined belowactual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposureforeign currency exchange rate riskwe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 44 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2016 were the euro chinese yuan renminbi the british pound and the indian rupee for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alonewe use a combination of forward contracts and at times options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedgewe have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2016 and 2015 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2016 and 2015 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 41 million and 54 million for continuing operations at october 31 2016 and october 31 2015 respectivelyinterest rate riskwe also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfoliowe issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficialin order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns50table of contentswe have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of october 31 2016 and 2015 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2016 and 2015 the sensitivity analyses for continuing operations indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments net of interest rate swaps of 51 million at october 31
