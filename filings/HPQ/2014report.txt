hp labs and certain cloudrelated business incubation projects among others   sales marketing and distribution   we manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups and purchases of hp products solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by hp or indirectly through a variety of partners including    retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores    resellers that sell our products and services frequently with their own valueadded products or services to targeted customer groups   distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers   original equipment manufacturers oems that integrate our products and services with their own products and services and sell the integrated solution   independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products   systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom it solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services and   advisory firms that provide various levels of management and it consulting including some systems integration work and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services    the mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region we believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales marketing and distribution efforts accordingly we are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect businesses while each of our business segments manages the execution of its own gotomarket and distribution strategy our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate for example we typically assign an account manager generally from eg or es to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers the account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise for other customers and for consumers pps typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smbs where appropriate   manufacturing and materials   we utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers oms around the world to manufacture hpdesigned products the use of oms is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for hpdesigned products we use multiple oms to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes in some circumstances thirdparty oems produce products that we purchase and resell under the hp brand in addition to our use of oms we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors  9                  table of contents   we utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products building products to order and configuring products to order we build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations alternatively configuring products to order enables units to match a customers particular hardware and software customization requirements our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers   we purchase materials supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors for most of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available however we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines laserjet supplies certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption we are dependent upon intel and amd as suppliers of x86 processors and microsoft for various software products however we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industrywide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   like other participants in the it industry we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days from time to time we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources frequently we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production we also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longerterm pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority price and availability of supply see risk factorswe depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   international   our products and services are available worldwide we believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and enterprise customers draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce provides stability to our operations provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products in addition we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries in this regard we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth   a summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property plant and equipment is set forth in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference approximately 65 of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2014 came from outside the united states us   for a discussion of risks attendant to hps international operations see risk factorsdue to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition in item 1a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item 7a and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference  10      table of contents  research and development   innovation is a key element of our culture our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences   hp labs together with the various research and development groups within our business segments are responsible for our research and development efforts hp labs is part of our corporate investments segment   expenditures for research and development were 34 billion in fiscal 2014 31 billion in fiscal 2013 and 34 billion in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative highquality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position   for a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities see risk factorsif we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   patents   our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position at october 31 2014 our worldwide patent portfolio included over 34000 patents which represents a decrease over the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 this decrease is attributable in part to the sale of a portfolio of mobile computing intellectual property ip in january 2014   patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed as our patent portfolio has been built over time the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary we believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate and maximizing our return on research and development investments no single patent is in itself essential to hp as a whole or to any of hps business segments   in addition to developing our patent portfolio we license ip from third parties as we deem appropriate we have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest these license arrangements include a number of crosslicenses with third parties   for a discussion of risks attendant to ip rights see risk factorsour revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the ip rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their ip rights in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   backlog   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business  11      table of contents  seasonality   general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results from time to time the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services for example european sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends see risk factorsour sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable in item 1a which is incorporated herein by reference   competition   we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings   the markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with longestablished positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms most product life cycles are short and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above in addition we compete with many of our current and potential partners including oems that design manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success moreover we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive   we have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices imaging and printingrelated products and services enterprise it infrastructure products and solutions multivendor customer services and it management software and solutions we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments   the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below   personal systems the markets in which personal systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and inventory obsolescence the decline in the pc market and the ongoing shift among customers to mobility products has further intensified competition in the pc market our primary competitors are lenovo group limited lenovo dell inc dell acer inc asustek computer inc apple inc toshiba corporation and samsung electronics co ltd samsung in particular regions we also experience competition from local companies and from genericallybranded or white box manufacturers our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio our innovation and research and development capabilities our brand and procurement leverage our ability to crosssell

conjunction with part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10k   because of the following factors as well as other variables affecting our results of operations past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods   if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited   we are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the pc market the growth of multiarchitecture devices running competing operating systems the market shift towards tablets within mobility the market shift to cloudrelated infrastructure software and services and the growth in softwareasaservice business models another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions our businessspecific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are going after new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model and gotomarket execution in addition we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges including weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the united states central eastern europe and russia and certain countries and businesses in asia we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs in addition we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our large portfolio of businesses the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate and the integration of acquired businesses if we do not succeed in these efforts or if these efforts are more costly or timeconsuming than expected our business and results of operations may be adversely affected which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business   in may 2012 we announced a companywide restructuring plan the restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and nonvoluntary workforce reductions significant risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the united states particularly in europe and asia decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees in addition our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected   competitive pressures could harm our revenue gross margin and prospects   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business and our competitors may target our key market segments we compete primarily on the basis of technology performance price quality reliability brand reputation distribution range of products and services ease of use of our products account relationships customer training service and support  18      table of contents security availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings if our products services support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria our results of operations and prospects could be harmed   we have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers   companies with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas in addition companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors which could reduce their business with us if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected   we face aggressive price competition for our products and services and as a result we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin in addition competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lowercost markets in which we compete may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer our cash flows results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures   because our business model is based on providing innovative and highquality products we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our competitors if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely affected in addition if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions we may lose market share in certain areas which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects   even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete for example our storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products in addition the performance of our business critical systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for unix servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our itaniumbased products revenue and margins also could decline due to increased competition from other types of products for example growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloudbased solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products in addition refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of hps laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business   if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop manufacture and market products services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality our revenue and gross margin may suffer   our longterm strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware software and services as we adapt to a changing and hybrid model of it delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated it solutions to successfully execute  19      table of contents on this strategy we need to continue evolving our focus towards the delivery of integrated it solutions for our customers and to continue to invest and expand into cloud computing security big data and mobility any failure to successfully execute this strategy including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial results   the process of developing new hightechnology products software services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products services and solutions is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations for example as the transition to an environment characterized by cloudbased computing and software being delivered as a service progresses we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloudbased solutions for our customers we must make longterm investments develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products services and solutions in addition after we develop a product we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins to accomplish this we must accurately forecast volumes mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements and we may not succeed at doing so within a given products life cycle or at all any delay in the development production or marketing of a new product service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market which could further harm our competitive position   in the course of conducting our business we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products services and solutions including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts as well as defects in thirdparty components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by thirdparty contractors or subcontractors or the employees of those contractors or subcontractors in order to address quality issues we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions however the products services and solutions that we offer are complex and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by thirdparties if we are unable to determine the cause find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix or patch to address quality issues with our products we may delay shipment to customers which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty replacement and other costs adversely affecting our profits if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers expectations in addition quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations   our plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline or at all and will involve significant time and expense which could disrupt or adversely affect our business   on october 6 2014 we announced plans to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies the separation which is currently targeted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015 is subject to approval by our board of directors of the final terms of the separation and market regulatory and certain other conditions unanticipated developments including changes in the competitive conditions of hewlettpackard enterprises and hp incs respective markets possible delays in obtaining various tax opinions or rulings regulatory approvals or clearances the uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in executing the separation could delay or prevent the  20      table of contents completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected   we have established a separation management office tasked with driving the separation process we expect that the process of completing the proposed separation will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the separation is not completed executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees which could adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion which could harm our businesses   the separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits   we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational marketing or other benefits from the separation as independent publiclytraded companies hewlettpackard enterprise and hp inc will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect their respective business financial condition and results of operations further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred   the proposed separation may result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners   uncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects the effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation   the separation could result in substantial tax liability   we intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the separation will qualify for both hp and its stockholders as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 368a1d and 355 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended in addition we intend to obtain a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs andor one or more opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the us federal income tax treatment of the separation for hp and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinions of outside counsel and any irs private letter ruling will be based among other things on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel or the irs if any of these assumptions or representations are or become inaccurate or incomplete reliance on the opinions andor irs private letter ruling may be affected an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in addition we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation including nonus tax expense resulting from separations in multiple nonus jurisdictions that do not legally provide for taxfree separations which may be material  21      table of contents  economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and expenses   our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware software and services in the markets in which we compete economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue gross margin earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels for example we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions particularly in the europe the middle east and africa emea region china and other highgrowth markets the us federal government spending cuts that went into effect on march 1 2013 may further reduce demand for our products services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the us government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states which could further reduce demand for our products services and solutions economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products services and solutions may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue gross margin cash flows and expenses   we also have experienced and may experience in the future gross margin declines in certain businesses reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors we are unable to pass on to our customers in addition our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment parts or components from our suppliersand our suppliers from their suppliersdue to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit   economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates borrowing costs currency exchange rates costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses   the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied which makes our future financial results less predictable   our revenue gross margin and profit vary among our products and services customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services delays or reductions in it spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services which could result in a significant decline in revenue in addition revenue declines in some of our businesses particularly our services businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose crossselling opportunities overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product service customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue competition lawsuits investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis in addition newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures and we may have difficulty establishing and  22      table of contents maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets market trends industry shifts competitive pressures commoditization of products seasonal rebates increased component or shipping costs regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may lead to adjustments to our operations moreover our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period   if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly our revenue gross margins and profitability could suffer   we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services including thirdparty resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability other distribution risks are described below     our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken     our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space moreover some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions including economic weakness and industry consolidation many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors financial conditions abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken     our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors     we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues and therefore make forecasting more difficult if we have excess or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory moreover our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors we also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively     we depend on thirdparty suppliers and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly   our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components products and services as well as our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules given the wide variety  23      table of contents of systems products and services that we offer the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world and the long lead times required to manufacture assemble and deliver certain components and products problems could arise in production planning and inventory management that could seriously harm us in addition our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive timeconsuming and resource intensive than expected other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages excess supply risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers as described below     shortages occasionally we may experience a shortage of or a delay in receiving certain components as a result of strong demand capacity constraints supplier financial weaknesses inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets disputes with suppliers some of whom are also customers disruptions in the operations of component suppliers other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers for example our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products hp represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by hp with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om if shortages or delays persist the price of certain components may increase and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose timesensitive sales incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers if we cannot adequately address supply issues we might have to reengineer some products or services offerings which could result in further costs and delays    oversupply in order to secure components for the provision of products or services at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into noncancelable commitments with vendors in addition we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margin    contractual terms as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the thencurrent market price we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices our gross margin could suffer and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence in addition many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize our competitors may obtain better pricing more favorable contractual terms and conditions and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that depending on the financial condition of the oms may create collectibility risks in addition certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us any of these actions by our competitors oms or suppliers could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition   24      table of contents    contingent workers we also rely on thirdparty suppliers for the provision of contingent workers and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future we may be subject to shortages oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers our ability to manage the size of and costs associated with the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws    single source suppliers our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology availability price quality or other considerations for example we rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs workstations and servers and amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products some of those processors are customized for our products new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations for some components such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements in addition we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under shortterm agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty the performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms may affect the quality quantity and price of components to hp the loss of a single source supplier the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue gross margin and cash flows    business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses   our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events for which we are predominantly selfinsured the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition six of our principal worldwide it data centers are located in the southern united states making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including shanghai singapore and india we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern united states to import products into the americas region our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general  25      table of contents infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions such as near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain   our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable   in some of our segments our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter this uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue earnings cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders there may be excess inventory alternatively if orders substantially exceed predicted demand we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter depending on when they occur in a quarter developments such as a systems failure component pricing movements component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected   we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition for example sales to governments particularly sales to the us government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year european sales are often weaker during the summer months demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends moreover to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches typically our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control   due to the international nature of our business political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue costs and expenses and financial condition   sales outside the united states make up approximately 65 of our net revenue in addition an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets including brazil russia india and china our future revenue gross margin expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors including    ongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts   longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers   trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production pricing and marketing of products    local labor conditions and regulations including local labor issues faced by specific hp suppliers and oms    managing a geographically dispersed workforce   changes in the regulatory or legal environment   26      table of contents    differing technology standards or customer requirements   import export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions   difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and changes in tax laws and   fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments    the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states for example we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture   currencies other than the us dollar including the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen can have an impact on our results expressed in us dollars in particular the economic uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt obligations and the related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions for example in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency our sales into such countries or into europe generally would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations in addition our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition   in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa for example as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the german public prosecutors office has been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of hp engaged in bribery embezzlement and tax evasion in addition the polish central anticorruption bureau is conducting investigations into potential fcpa violations by a former employee of an hp subsidiary in connection with certain publicsector transactions in poland although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation  27      table of contents  any failure by us to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects and the costs expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are different than expected   as part of our business strategy we may acquire companies or businesses divest businesses or assets enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business collectively business combination and investment transactions in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions some of which may be large or complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses products services or employees risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following any of which could adversely affect our revenue gross margin profitability and financial results    managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations   we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction and the timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees advisors suppliers or other thirdparties    business combination and investment transactions have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings including those related to severance pay early retirement costs employee benefit costs goodwill and asset impairment charges charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts asset impairment charges inventory adjustments assumed litigation and other liabilities legal accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans   any increased or unexpected costs unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable   our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by thirdparties or their representatives    our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired companys product quality financial disclosures accounting practices or internal control deficiencies   the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts and during the course of our due diligence we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated   in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction we may issue common stock potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders   we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisitionrelated or other borrowings as well as other factors could affect our liquidity and financial condition   our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate   28                      table of contents     an announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter   business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation    if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products services and technology internally which may put us at a competitive disadvantage    we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets for example in our third fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 80 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our former services segment and a 12 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the compaq trade name acquired in 2002 in addition in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012 we recorded an 88 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with autonomy if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units we may incur additional charges which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges   integration issues are often complex timeconsuming and expensive and without proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business the challenges involved in integration include    combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise   convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales marketing and distribution efforts   consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes   minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns    persuading employees that business cultures are compatible maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired companys nonus employees integrating employees into hp correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs   coordinating and combining administrative manufacturing research and development and other operations subsidiaries facilities and relationships with thirdparties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards controls and procedures    achieving savings from supply chain integration and   managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions    while we do not currently plan to divest any of our major businesses we do regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic  29      table of contents objectives we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated in addition we may experience greater dissynergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which if not satisfied or obtained may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results   our revenue cost of sales and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights   we rely upon patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states similar laws in other countries and agreements with our employees customers suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell provide or otherwise use in our operations however any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged invalidated infringed or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position further the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states therefore in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized thirdparty copying or use this too could adversely affect our competitive position   because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by thirdparties we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these thirdparties at all or on reasonable terms or such thirdparties may demand crosslicenses to our intellectual property in addition it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition thirdparties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction consequently we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights   thirdparties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as hp and its customers the number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future if we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source our operations could be adversely affected even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products enter into costly settlement or license agreements pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing marketing or selling certain of our products even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us  30      table of contents  finally our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees in certain countries primarily in europe proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from hp levies upon equipment such as pcs mfds and printers alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product all of which are affected by several factors including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries and could be substantial consequently the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices remains uncertain   our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly   the risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following    the success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients we may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition business failure contract expiration or their selection of a competing service provider or decision to insource services in addition we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients as a result of business downturns or for other business reasons we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services in addition our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience and we may not be able to fully recover our investments in such circumstances   the pricing and other terms of some of our it services agreements particularly our longterm it outsourcing services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements including delays caused by factors outside our control could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our it services business   some of our it services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement these agreements often involve the construction of new it systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development construction and deployment phases any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our it services business   31      table of contents    some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable thirdparty the benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors generally if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments which could decrease the cash flows of our it services business    if we do not hire train motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients our profitably could suffer for example if our employee utilization rate is too low our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer if that utilization rate is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand we might need to redeploy existing personnel increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels all of which could also negatively affect our profitability in addition if we have more employees than we need with certain skill sets or in certain geographies we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies    failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations   our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements in particular our contracts with federal state provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties which may include termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments and in the case of our government contracts fines and suspension from future government contracting in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts which could include claims for up to treble damages further any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them regardless of its accuracy may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts if our customer contracts are terminated if we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue   hps stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate which may make future prices of hps stock difficult to predict   hps stock price like that of other technology companies can be volatile some of the factors that could affect our stock price are    speculation coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about or actual changes in our business strategic position market share organizational structure operations financial condition financial reporting and results effectiveness of costcutting efforts value or liquidity of our investments exposure to market volatility prospects business combination or   32      table of

price of hp stock for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources   failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to capital markets   our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies two of those rating agencies moodys investors service and standard amp poors ratings services downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012 and a third rating agency fitch ratings downgraded our ratings twice during that fiscal year in addition moodys investors service downgraded our ratings again in november 2012 our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by moodys investors service past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to capital markets   we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations   in connection with the preparation of hps consolidated financial statements we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors our most critical accounting estimates are described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report in addition as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we make certain estimates including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances they are subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could adversely affect our results of operations  33      table of contents  unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability   we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the united states is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability   in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition key employees and failure to do so could seriously harm us   in order to be successful we must attract retain train motivate develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and it support positions identifying developing internally or hiring externally training and retaining qualified executives engineers skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and sharebased compensation our sharebased incentive awards include stock options restricted stock units and performancebased restricted units some of which contain conditions relating to hps stock price performance and hps longterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain if the anticipated value of such sharebased incentive awards does not materialize if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive or if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting sharebased incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our

a constant currency basis in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the leading contributors to the hp net revenue decline were key account runoff in es and lower printing supplies volume partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in personal systems from commercial personal computers pcs which experienced growth across all product categories along with growth in consumer notebooks hps gross margin increased by 08 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in es and favorable currency impacts from the japanese yen and continued cost structure improvements in printing we continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio hps operating margin was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the gross margin increase improved business performance primarily in printing es and personal systems and lower intangible asset amortization offset by higher restructuring charges investments in research and development rampd and higher selling general and administrative sgampa expenses the increase in sgampa expenses was partially offset by gains from sales of real estate   our business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations generating 123 billion in fiscal 2014 additionally we

representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations one set of challenges relates to continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and  44      table of contents

increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our gotomarket execution the macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge a discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is set forth below     in personal systems we have been negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility products which has reduced the demand for pcs particularly consumer notebooks if benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize we will continue to be negatively impacted by this trend however the pace of the market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization and hp is gaining market share in personal systems we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to multios multiarchitecture geography customer segments and other key attributes in fiscal 2014 personal systems experienced revenue growth in commercial pcs with growth across all product categories particularly notebooks along with growth in consumer notebooks the increase in demand was due in part to customers migrating from the windows xp operating system benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle and new product introductions   in printing we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets as well as an overall competitive pricing environment to be successful in addressing these challenges we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers in fiscal 2014 printing experienced a revenue decline and an increase in operating profit as we continued our print strategies with a focus on driving high value printer unit placements in the consumer market our ink in the office products are driving unit volume due to demand for our officejet pro product lines particularly our officejet pro x printers which leverage our pagewide array technology the ink in the office initiative targets shifting ink into smbs more profitably in the commercial market our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offer a positive annuity of toner we are accomplishing this in two growth areas in multifunction printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand and in managed print services which presents a strong aftermarket supplies opportunity we plan to continue this focus on replenishing the installed base with valueadded units and expanding our innovative ink and laser programs   in eg we are experiencing revenue challenges due to multiple market trends including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing infrastructure products the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment in addition demand for our business critical systems bcs products continues to weaken along with the overall market for unix products and the effect of lower bcs revenue is impacting technology services ts to be successful in overcoming these challenges we must address business model shifts and gotomarket execution challenges and continue to pursue new product innovation in areas such as cloud and data center computing softwaredefined networking storage blade servers and wireless networking in fiscal 2014 eg experienced a decline in revenue and operating

incorporated herein by reference   critical accounting policies and estimates   general   the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hps board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows  46      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured as well as other revenue recognition principles including industry specific revenue recognition guidance   we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements we enter into which contain nonstandard terms and conditions further many of our arrangements include multiple elements as a result significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for each of those elements   we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer for elements with no standalone value we recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables if the arrangement includes a customernegotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting in arrangements with combined units of accounting changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract   we establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe of selling price is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe is available we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and in rare instances using the price established by management having the relevant authority tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers esp is established based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives pricing practices and controls customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles we may modify or develop new gotomarket practices in the future which may result in changes in selling prices impacting both vsoe of selling price and esp in most arrangements with multiple elements the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price however the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical  47      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement   we reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive   for hardware products we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners including resellers distributors and valueadded solution providers when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for indirect sales to channel partners we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale   for the various software products we sell eg operating system software network enabling software it and management software and enterprise security software we assess whether the software products were sold standalone or with hardware products if the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware and is morethanincidental we treat it as a software deliverable   we recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied termbased software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license we use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements such as postcontract support exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on an ifandwhenavailable basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered   for hosting or saas arrangements we recognize revenue as the service is delivered generally on a straightline basis over the contractual period of performance in hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied in hosting arrangements that include software licenses we consider the rights provided to the customer eg ownership of a license contract termination provisions and feasibility of the customer to operate the software in determining when to recognize revenue for the licenses   we recognize revenue from fixedprice support or maintenance contracts including extended warranty contracts and software postcontract customer support agreements ratably over the contract period for certain fixedprice contracts such as consulting arrangements we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method we estimate the total expected labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date we apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made on fixedprice contracts for design and build projects to design develop and construct software infrastructure and systems we recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentageofcompletion method we use the costtocost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixedprice contract provisions for estimated losses on fixedprice contracts are recognized in the period when such  48      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales in circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed contract method   outsourcing services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event we recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unitpriced contracts revenue for fixedprice outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straightline basis if the service is provided evenly over the contract term provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are recorded as a component of cost of sales   warranty   we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis our standard product warranty terms generally include postsales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms repair costs product call rates average cost per call current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor depending upon the product over the last three fiscal years the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 27 and 29 of annual net product revenue respectively   restructuring   we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans historical experiences and negotiated settlements for a full description of our restructuring actions refer to our discussions of restructuring in results of operations below and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which are incorporated herein by reference   retirement and postretirement benefits   our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates mortality rates expected increases in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of highquality fixedincome securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan as a result of a historical study of the us plans in fiscal 2014 hp adopted a new mortality rate table which incorporated newly released mortality rates published by the society of actuaries this resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately 870 million for the us defined benefit plans the  49      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our longterm actual experience and future expectations the expected longterm return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations historical portfolio results historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class in any fiscal year significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected longterm return on plan assets historically differences between the actual return and expected longterm return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation shortterm performance relative to expected longterm performance and to a lesser extent differences between target and actual investment allocations the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures for the recognition of net periodic benefit cost the calculation of the expected longterm return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year   our major assumptions vary by plan and the weightedaverage rates used are set forth in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference the following table provides the impact changes in the weightedaverage assumptions of discount rates the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected longterm return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2014                      change in percentage points    change in net

assets     25     68        taxes on earnings   we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year   we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse   we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize in determining the need for a valuation allowance we consider future market growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination likewise if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located  50      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the us we plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and longterm investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations based on these assumptions we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the us and the amounts we expect to distribute to the us and provide the us federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the us further as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024 material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and longterm investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the us and our related future effective tax rate   we are subject to income taxes in the us and approximately 105 other countries and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge these positions which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities accordingly our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our income tax provision net income and cash flows our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions intercompany transactions and related interest for a further discussion on taxes on earnings refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference   inventory   we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess obsolescence or impaired balances factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand technological changes product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing physical deterioration and quality issues   goodwill   we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units   goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we changed our reporting units in connection with continued operational synergies and interdependencies between the enterprise servers storage and networking reporting unit and the ts reporting unit within the eg segment we combined these reporting units to create the eg reporting unit as of october 31 2014 our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified  51      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  in note 2 except for es which includes two reporting units mphasis limited and the remainder of es   in the first step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and to a lesser extent the market approach under the income approach we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on the weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with businessspecific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows under the market approach we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publiclytraded companies to the reporting unit when market comparables are not meaningful or not available we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach for the mphasis limited reporting unit we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value   in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hps market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over hps market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions if the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions we reevaluate reporting unit fair values which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate andor other assumptions this reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units   estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publiclytraded companies in addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit   if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in the second step the reporting units assets including any unrecognized intangible assets liabilities and noncontrolling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying amount the difference is recorded as an impairment loss   our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 did not result in any impairment charges the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 18 to approximately 12000 of carrying amounts the software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 18  52                  table of contents   hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued   in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 6 to approximately 10000 of the carrying amounts with the software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 6 the fair value of the software reporting unit is estimated using a weighting of both the income and market approaches our software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to saas and gotomarket execution challenges if we are not successful in addressing these challenges our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the software reporting unit the fair value of the software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publiclytraded companies changes in managements business strategy or significant declines in our stock price which could result in an indicator of impairment   intangible assets   we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of our finitelived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount the finitelived intangible assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment loss if any is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value we estimate the fair value of finitelived intangible assets by using an income approach or when available and appropriate using a market approach   fair value of derivative instruments   we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we use forwards swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at october 31 2014 the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was 547 billion assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were 980 million and 405 million respectively as of october 31 2014   fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves hp and counterparty credit risk foreign currency exchange rates and forward and spot prices  53      table of

involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including those consisting of ip commercial securities employment employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular case based on our experience we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference are not a meaningful indicator of hps potential liability litigation is inherently unpredictable however we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us nevertheless cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and as of october 31 2014 it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements   accounting pronouncements   for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference   results of operations   revenue from our international operations has historically represented and we expect will continue to represent a majority of our overall net revenue as a result

8 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to the rationalization of rampd in eg for bcs cost savings from restructuring and higher value added rampd tax subsidy credits the decrease

general and administrative    sgampa expense increased 1 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher compensation costs litigation expenses and higher selling costs from

restructuring charges in fiscal 2015   restructuring charges decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the 21 billion charge recorded in fiscal 2012 for the 2012 plan restructuring charges for fiscal 2013 were approximately 10 billion which included 12 billion of charges related to the 2012 plan that were partially offset by a reversal of 190 million of severance charges related to our fiscal 2010 es restructuring plan   interest and other net   interest and other net expense increased by 7 million in fiscal 2014 the increase was due primarily to higher currency transaction losses partially offset by lower interest expense from a lower average debt balance   interest and other net expense decreased by 255 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease was driven primarily by lower currency transaction losses coupled with lower interest expense due to lower average debt balances and lower investment losses   provision for taxes   our effective tax rates were 235 215 and 60 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lowertax jurisdictions throughout the world the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented were puerto rico singapore netherlands china and ireland we plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the us and therefore have not provided us taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings   in addition to the above factors the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was impacted by nondeductible goodwill impairments and increases in valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets   for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and further explanation of our provision for taxes see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which

1amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our longterm debt and do not include any fair value adjustments discounts or premiums 2amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our longterm debt we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our us dollar global notes to variable interest rates the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31 2014 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on longterm debt 3purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 4in fiscal 2015 hp anticipates making contributions of 686 million to its nonus pension plans expects to pay benefits of 35 million to its us nonqualified pension plan participants and expects to pay claims of 47 million under its postretirement benefit plans our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements as established by local government funding and taxing authorities expected contributions and payments to our pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes for more information on our retirement and postretirement benefit plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference 5we expect future cash payments of 18 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes 10 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2015 with the remaining approximately 800 million cash payments to be made through fiscal 2021 payments for restructuring have been   76      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued    excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments for more information on our restructuring activities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference    6as of october 31 2014 we had approximately 35 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions these liabilities and related interest and penalties include 27 million expected to be paid within one year for the remaining amount we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities for more information on our uncertain tax positions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 which is incorporated herein by reference    offbalance sheet arrangements   as part of our ongoing business we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes   we have thirdparty revolving shortterm financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers the total aggregate maximum capacity of the financing arrangements was 30 billion as of october 31 2014 including an aggregate maximum capacity of 11 billion in nonrecourse financing arrangements and an aggregate maximum capacity of 19 billion in partialrecourse facilities for more information on our thirdparty

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below   actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure    foreign currency exchange rate risk    we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments anticipated sales anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2014 were the euro the british pound chinese yuan renminbi and the japanese yen for most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures if taken alone   we use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition when debt is denominated in a foreign currency we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures alternatively we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2014 and 2013 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at october 31 2014 and 2013 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 62 million and 80 million at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively   interest rate risk   we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables   we issue longterm debt in either us dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing we often use interest rate andor currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve us dollar liborbased floating interest expense  78      table of contents the swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments however we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial   in order to hedge the fair value of certain fixedrate investments we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns we may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of liborbased interest income received on certain variablerate investments we may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixedrate interest returns   we have performed sensitivity analyses as of october 31 2014 and 2013 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve with all other variables held constant the analyses cover our debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt investments financing receivables and interest rate swaps the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at october 31 2014 and 2013 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt investments and financing receivables net of interest rate swaps of 80 million at october 31 2014 and 95 million at october 31 2013  79                   table of contents   item 8 financial statements and supplementary data       table of contents

remeasured into us dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities net revenue costs and expenses denominated in nonus dollars are recorded in us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period hp includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in interest and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings certain nonus subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency and hp records the translation of their assets and liabilities into us dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets   accounting pronouncements   in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition the amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services hp is required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 early adoption is  89      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   notes to

retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application hp is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments and the transition alternatives on its consolidated financial statements   in april 2014 the fasb issued guidance which changes the criteria for identifying a discontinued operation the guidance limits the definition of a discontinued operation to the disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results hp is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with early adoption permitted for transactions that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued   in july 2013 the fasb issued a new accounting standard requiring the presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets rather than as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists hp is required to adopt this new standard on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 however early adoption is permitted as is retrospective application hp will adopt the new standard in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 on a prospective basis adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material effect on hps consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition    general    hp recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services are rendered the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured additionally hp recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners including resellers distributors or valueadded solution providers at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from hp and hp has completed its obligations related to the sale hp generally recognizes revenue for its standalone software sales to channel partners on receipt of evidence that the software has been sold to a specific end user hp limits the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services future performance obligations or subject to customerspecified refund or return rights   hp reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including price protection rebates promotions other volumebased incentives and expected returns future market conditions and product transitions may require hp to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered for certain incentive programs hp estimates the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive   in instances when revenue is derived from sales of thirdparty vendor products or services hp records revenue on a gross basis when hp is a principal to the transaction and on a net basis when hp is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor hp considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent most notably whether hp is the primary obligor to the customer has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks  90      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and

investments in publiclytraded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded for corporate government and assetbacked debt securities fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate and government debt securities traded on active exchanges fair value is based on observable quoted prices the valuation of alternative investments such as limited partnerships and joint ventures may require significant management judgment for alternative investments valuation is based on net asset value nav as reported by the asset manager and adjusted for cash flows if necessary in making such an assessment a variety of factors are reviewed by management including but not limited to the timeliness of nav as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last nav reported by the asset manager depending on the amount of management judgment the lack of nearterm liquidity and the absence of quoted market prices these assets are classified in level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy further depending on how quickly hp can redeem its hedge fund investments and the extent of any adjustments to nav hedge funds are classified in either level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy common collective trusts interests in 10312 entities and registered investment companies are valued at nav the valuation for some of these assets requires judgment due  115      table of contents

                    investment policy    hps investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments the majority of the plans investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets a number of the plans investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures and hp may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures   the target asset allocation selected for each us plan reflects a riskreturn profile hp believes is appropriate relative to each plans liability structure and return goals hp conducts periodic assetliability studies for us plans in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plans forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs hp invests a portion of the us defined benefit plan assets and postretirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets   outside the us asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan as in the us investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations in some countries local regulations may restrict asset allocations typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed hp reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan  116                   table of contents   hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   notes to consolidated financial statements continued   note 4 retirement

major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers each countrys specific inflation outlook because hps investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader

and performancebased awards employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stockbased awards   restricted stock awards are nonvested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units restricted stock awards and cashsettled awards are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant during the vesting period ownership of the restricted stock cannot be transferred restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant the dividends paid on restricted stock are nonforfeitable restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent

however future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings hp will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment   goodwill impairments   there were no goodwill impairments in fiscal 2014 and 2013   during fiscal 2012 hp determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis for the es reporting unit these indicators included the trading values of hps stock at the time of the impairment test coupled with market conditions and business trends within es the fair value of the es reporting unit was based on the income approach the decline in the fair value of the es reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the risk factor that was included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows the increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium resulting from trading values of hp stock at the time of the impairment test the resulting adjustments to discount rates caused a significant reduction in the fair value for the es reporting unit based on the step one and step two analyses hp recorded an 80 billion goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2012 and there was no remaining goodwill in the es reporting unit as of october 31 2012 prior to completing the goodwill impairment test hp tested the recoverability of the es longlived assets other than goodwill and concluded that such assets were not impaired   also during fiscal 2012 the software segment included two reporting units which were autonomy and the legacy hp software business hp initiated its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and concluded that fair value was below carrying amount for the autonomy reporting unit the fair value of the autonomy reporting unit was based on the income approach   the decline in the estimated fair value of the autonomy reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the risk factor that was included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows the increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium that resulted from trading values of hp stock at the time of the impairment test the lower projected operating results reflected changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth rates market trends business mix cost structure expected deal synergies and other expectations about the anticipated shortterm and longterm operating results of the autonomy business these assumptions incorporated hps analysis of what it believes were accounting improprieties incomplete disclosures and misrepresentations at autonomy that occurred prior to the autonomy acquisition with respect to autonomys preacquisition business and related operating results in addition as noted above when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit hp may need to adjust  136      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   notes to consolidated financial statements continued   note 9 acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets continued  discount rates andor other assumptions in order to derive a reasonable implied control premium when comparing the sum of the fair values of hps reporting units to hps market capitalization due to the trading values of hp stock at the time of the impairment test the resulting adjustments to the discount rate to arrive at an appropriate control premium caused a significant reduction in the fair value for the autonomy reporting unit as well as the fair values for hps other reporting units   prior to conducting step one of the goodwill impairment test for the autonomy reporting unit hp first evaluated the recoverability of the longlived assets including intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present hp tests longlived assets other than goodwill for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to its undiscounted cash flows hp considered the lowerthanexpected revenue and profitability levels over a sustained period of time the trading values of hp stock and downward revisions to managements short and longterm forecasts for the autonomy business to be indicators of impairment for the autonomy longlived assets based on the results of the recoverability test hp determined that the carrying amount of the autonomy asset group exceeded its undiscounted cash flows and was therefore not recoverable hp then compared the fair value of the asset group to its carrying amount and determined the impairment loss the impairment loss was allocated to the carrying values of the longlived assets but not below their individual fair values based on the analysis hp recorded an impairment charge of 31 billion on intangible assets which resulted in a remaining carrying amount of approximately 08 billion as of october 31 2012 the decline in the fair value of the autonomy intangible assets was attributable to the same factors as discussed above for the fair value of the autonomy reporting unit   the decline in the fair value of the autonomy reporting unit and autonomy intangibles as well as fair value changes for other assets and liabilities in the step two goodwill impairment test resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying amount of the goodwill for the autonomy reporting unit as a result hp recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 57 billion which resulted in a 12 billion remaining carrying amount of autonomy goodwill as of october 31 2012 both the goodwill impairment charge and the intangible assets impairment charge totaling 88 billion were included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of earnings   subsequent to the autonomy purchase price allocation period which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and in conjunction with hps annual goodwill impairment testing hp identified certain indicators of impairment the indicators of impairment included lowerthanexpected revenue and profitability levels over a sustained period of time the trading values of hp stock and downward revisions to managements short and longterm forecasts for the autonomy business hp revised its multiyear forecast for the autonomy business and the timing of this forecast revision coincided with the timing of hps overall forecasting process for all reporting units which is completed each year in the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment analysis the change in assumptions used in the revised forecast and the fair value estimates utilized in the impairment testing of the autonomy goodwill and longlived assets incorporated insights gained from having owned the autonomy business for the preceding year the revised forecast reflected changes related to organic revenue growth rates current market trends business mix cost structure expected deal synergies and other expectations about the anticipated short and longterm operating results of the autonomy business driven by hps analysis regarding certain accounting improprieties incomplete disclosures and misrepresentations at autonomy that occurred prior to the autonomy acquisition with respect to autonomys preacquisition business and related operating results accordingly the change in fair values represented a change in accounting estimate that occurred outside the purchase price allocation period resulting in the recorded impairment charge   based on the results of the annual impairment test for all other reporting units hp concluded that no other goodwill impairment existed as of august 1 2012 apart from the impairment charges discussed above  137

accumulated amounts   in fiscal 2012 hp recorded total intangible asset impairment charges of 43 billion of which 31 billion was related to the autonomy reporting unit as described above the remaining 12 billion was related to a change in the compaq branding strategy in may 2012 hp approved a change to its branding strategy for pcs which has resulted in a more limited and focused use of the compaq trade name acquired in fiscal 2002 in conjunction with the change in branding strategy hp revised its assumption as to the useful life of that intangible asset which resulted in a reclassification of

obligations to mitigate counterparty credit risk hp has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their  143      table of

dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institutions credit rating and other factors hps established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties master netting agreements further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting hp to net amounts due from hp to counterparty against amounts due to hp from the same counterparty under certain conditions   to further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties hp has collateral security agreements that allow hp to hold collateral from or require hp to post collateral to counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of hp and its counterparties if hps or the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified credit rating either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives net liability position collateral is generally posted within two business days the fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was 38 million and 207 million at october 31 2014 and october 31 2013 respectively all of which were fully collateralized within two business days   under hps derivative contracts the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting hp that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating this credit contingent provision did not affect hps financial position or cash flows as of october 31 2014 and october 31 2013    fair value hedges    hp issues longterm debt in us dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing hp may enter into fair value hedges such as interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily us dollar liborbased floating interest expense the swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for us dollardenominated amounts alternatively hp may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixedrate debt would be beneficial   when investing in fixedrate instruments hp may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges   for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges hp recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item in interest and other net in the consolidated statements of earnings in the period of change    cash flow hedges    hp uses a combination of forward contracts and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and to a lesser extent cost of sales operating expenses and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the us dollar hps foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months however hedges related to longer term procurement arrangements extend several years and forward contracts associated with salestype and directfinancing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term which typically range from two to five years  144      table of contents  hewlettpackard company and subsidiaries   notes to consolidated financial statements continued   note 11 financial instruments continued   for

effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged instrument with the change in fair value of the derivative for foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges hp measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item both of which are based on forward rates hp recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge in the consolidated statements of earnings in the same period in which ineffectiveness occurs amounts excluded from
