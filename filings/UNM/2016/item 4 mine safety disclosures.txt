its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium we undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management if the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations we remain contingently liable in the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure we may also require assets to be held in trust letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers although we have controls to minimize our exposure the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsin general the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by our us insurance subsidiaries under group or individual life or group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policies during 2015 was 750 thousand per covered life per policy the retention amount has been

reinsurance agreements that collectively cede approximately 55 percent of unum us group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our us insurance subsidiaries  these reinsurance agreements for unum us group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory accounting principles but do not meet insurance risk transfer in accordance with applicable us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and therefore are not accounted for as reinsurance in our consolidated gaap financial statementscertain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to northwind reinsurance company northwind re and fairwind insurance company fairwind both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries captive reinsurers domiciled in the united states with unum group as the ultimate parent these captive reinsurers were established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency during 2015 tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary established for the same purpose and domiciled in the united states merged with unum america with unum

from subsidiaries contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 12 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8  10reserves for policy and contract benefitsthe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report as liabilities policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies these reserves are the amounts which with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables interest rates and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries these differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods the assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable if actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions additional reserves may be required the key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates claim resolution rates mortality and morbidity rates policy persistency interest rates premium rate increases and any applicable policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred as we believe appropriatethe consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits the change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses deaths and benefit payments if policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits for further discussion of reserves refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a critical accounting estimates and the discussion of segment operating results included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 investments investment activities are an integral part of our business and profitability is significantly affected by investment results we segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines generally our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses we seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner subject to constraints of quality liquidity diversification and regulatory considerations our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk we may redistribute investments among our different lines of business when necessary to adjust the cash flow andor duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk our determination of investment strategy relies on longterm measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves we also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and  11the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to

under review highlights the potential direction of a shortterm or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency events that may trigger this action include mergers acquisitions recapitalizations regulatory actions criteria changes or operating developments ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level this status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list a rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating  see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  ratings contained herein in item 7 for our current outlook issuer credit and financial strength ratings see also further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1acompetition there is significant competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell we are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and nontraditional competitors with changes in product offerings enrollment approaches and technology solutions we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength ratings and claimspaying ratings in the individual and group disability markets we compete in the united states with a number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products our principal competitors for our other products including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction include the largest insurance companies in the united states some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claimspaying ratings some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete in the united kingdom we compete for the individual and group products we sell with a mix of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers we have observed some of these providers aggressively trying to maintain or grow market share in a difficult economic environment characterized by very low interest rates and expense pressures on employers and individuals we believe the need for the types of products we offer is significant in both the united states and the united kingdom individuals and families often live paycheck to paycheck with a considerable chance of being out of work pressure is also mounting on governments as to the sustainability of public assistance based on current penetration levels we believe there is substantial upside growth potential 12all areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market there is a risk that purchasers of employee benefits products may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us the effect of competition may as a result adversely affect the persistency of these and other products as well as our ability to sell products in the futurewe must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers we compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings financial strength support services and compensation sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokersfor further discussion refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1aregulation we and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive and comprehensive supervision and regulation both in the united states and in the united kingdom the laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change new or existing laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as a result of the financial market and economic challenges in recent years regulation and the cost of compliance with regulation has continued to increaseinsurance regulation and oversightour us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business and by the us department of labor dol on a national basis primarily for the protection of policyholders state insurance departments in the us generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including the power to license and examine insurance companies regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct license agents and brokers approve policy forms approve premium rates and subsequent increases thereon for certain insurance products establish reserve requirements and solvency standards place limitations on shareholder dividends prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments and regulate reinsurance transactions our us insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business the domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing such as market conduct issues examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct such as a review of sales practices including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers as well as underwriting claims and customer service practices and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers the dol enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plansour uk insurance subsidiary unum limited is subject to dual regulation by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pra oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and daytoday supervision of insurance companies the fca seeks to protect consumers and oversees financial services products and practices including those governing insurance companies in the uk capital requirementsriskbased capital rbc standards for us life insurance companies are prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic the domiciliary states of our us insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the rbc model formula of the naic which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers the basis of the system is a riskbased formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurers business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer the life and health rbc formula is designed to measure annually i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks the formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized the formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally  13the naic continues with its initiative regarding assessment of the statebased solvency regulation framework to identify opportunities to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments the topics of its assessment include capital requirements governance and risk management statutory accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance this ongoing assessment will likely result in significant changes to us insurance regulation and solvency standards including those for our us insurance subsidiaries this initiative resulted in the adoption of the naic risk management and own risk and solvency assessment orsa model act which following enactment at the state level requires insurers to provide at least annually a grouplevel perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks of the states where our traditional us insurance subsidiaries are domiciled maine new york and tennessee have enacted orsa requirements and we filed our initial orsa summary report with the applicable insurance regulators in 2015the naic has adopted a valuation manual containing a principlesbased approach to life insurance company reserves although the naic targets a january 2017 effective date to begin a threeyear implementation period that would apply only for new business the principlesbased approach will not become effective unless it is enacted into law by a minimum number of state legislatures the timing and the effect of these changes are uncertain at this timethe naic has established a subgroup to study the insurance industrys use of captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and is considering ways to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers the naic continues to study this issue and most recently adopted a proposal to subject certain captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to the same capital requirements as traditional insurers as the naic continues to examine the issue we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of their work although we believe it to be unlikely a potential outcome of the naic study is that companies could be prohibited from using captive reinsurers no changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the naic and it is too early to predict the extent of any changes that might be made accordingly we expect to continue our strategy of using captive reinsurers to manage risks and enhance capital efficiency while monitoring the naics study and proposed changes in regulations see reinsurance contained herein in this item 1 for further discussionthe pra has statutory requirements including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins to which unum limited must adhere current solvency standards require an insurance company to hold capital equal to the greater of i a formulaic calculation of capital related to liabilities or ii a riskbased assessment of capital which is company specific reflecting the insurance companys individual risk profile as of january 1 2016 solvency ii a european union directive that prescribes new capital requirements and risk management standards that are the result of a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the european insurance industry replaced the previous capital requirements for unum limited our european holding company is also subject to the solvency ii requirements relevant to insurance holding companies while its subsidiaries the unum european economic area eea group which includes unum limited are subject to group supervision under solvency ii solvency ii results in amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers including i requirements to demonstrate adequate financial resources including quantitative requirements technical provisions and calculation of solvency ii capital requirements through either an approved full or partial internal model or the european standard formula approach ii requirements to demonstrate an adequate system of governance including effective risk management underpinned by prospective risk identification and quantification and iii disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements the unum eea group received approval from the pra to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the solvency ii capital regime is implemented as a result there is no material change to capital requirements or to solvency ratios for the unum eea group unum eea group will however be subject to increased disclosure requirements in its reporting to the pra beginning in 2016the international association of insurance supervisors iais is developing a common framework comframe for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs that contemplates groupwide supervision across national boundaries including uniform standards for insurer corporate governance and enterprise risk management a framework for group capital adequacy assessment that accounts for groupwide risks and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges we do not qualify as an iaig under the current criteria for designating an iaig however we monitor the activities of the iais for the potential that comframe could apply to us in the future the iais has announced that it expects to develop a riskbased global insurance capital standard applicable to iaigs with implementation scheduled to begin in 2019 at this time we cannot predict what if any additional capital requirements compliance costs or other requirements this proposed standard might impose on us if adopted 14see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources contained herein in item 7 and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 insurance holding company regulationwe and our us insurance subsidiaries excluding captive reinsurers are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which currently include maine massachusetts tennessee south carolina and new york these laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system including information concerning capital structure ownership management financial condition and certain intercompany transactions transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and if material require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulatorin addition such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders including our company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources  cash available from subsidiaries contained herein in item 7there are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect us and our insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level the various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate governance groupwide supervision of insurance holding companies adjustments to rbc calculations to account for groupwide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies including a requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a us insurer submit to the lead state insurance regulator an annual enterprise risk report which identifies activities circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that if not remedied properly are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole the naic has adopted the corporate governance annual disclosure model act and the corporate governance annual disclosure model regulation which would require us insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices the model act and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in a particular state at this time we cannot predict what if any additional compliance costs or other requirements the model act and regulation might impose on us if adoptedthe laws of most states including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company where these laws apply to us there can be no effective change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change the usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company although this presumption is rebuttable consequently a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the states of domicile of the insurance companyies sought to be acquired or whose holding company is sought to be acquired will be in violation of these laws such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions i injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those shares by the applicable insurance regulators ii prohibition of voting of such shares and iii other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators further many states insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a nondomiciled insurance company doing business in the state these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control however they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted prenotification laws these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of our company including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable  15federal laws and regulations enacted in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the united states doddfrank directs various government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law many of which remain to be completed among other provisions doddfrank creates a new framework for regulation of the overthecounter derivatives markets including requiring that certain swaps be executed through a centralized exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse and subjecting major swap participants to capital and margin ie collateral requirements which will likely have the effect of increasing the costs of hedging generally and the credit risk posed by some counterparties we use derivative transactions to help us manage certain risks in our business new margin requirements for cleared and uncleared transactions are expected to require the posting of higher margin levels for our derivatives activities and also may narrowly restrict the range of eligible collateral which may require us to hold more of our assets in cash or cash equivalents that generate lower yields than other investments doddfrank also established a financial stability oversight council fsoc with authority to subject systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies such as us to supervision and stricter prudential regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve board including stricter requirements and limitations relating to riskbased capital leverage liquidity stress testing and credit exposure and in certain circumstances limitations on acquisitions or combinations restrictions on product offerings andor requirements to sell assets the fsoc adopted final rules for evaluating whether a nonbank financial company should be designated as systemically important we have not been designated as a systemically important financial company and based on the quantitative criteria set forth in the final rules at this time we believe it is unlikely that we will be subject to such designation in addition doddfrank established a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry other than with respect to health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the us financial system and recommending insurers potentially including us that should be designated for stricter regulation the fio released its report on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states which concluded that modernization and improvement are possible through a combination of steps by states and certain actions by the federal government the report made recommendations for enhanced uniformity and efficiency by states in the areas of insolvency and marketplace regulation and for direct federal involvement in certain areas such as for the fio to engage in supervisory colleges and also to study and report

identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures discussed below are factors that may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company including those in this document or made by us elsewhere such as in earnings release investor calls investor conference presentations or press releases see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1sustained periods of low interest rates in the longterm investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products and projecting our pension obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition further declines in interest rates andor the continuance of the current level of low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products an interest or discount rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products we set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in that case the reserves may eventually be insufficient resulting in the need to increase our reserves andor increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs our expectations for the future investment returns on plan assets are based on a combination of historical market performance current market conditions and future capital market assumptions obtained from external consultants and economists the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period increases or decreases in longterm interest rates as well as equity market volatility will impact the fair value of our plan assets and may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans andor increased pension costs which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see reserves for policy and contract benefits contained herein in item 1 critical accounting

notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionactual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionhistorical results may not be indicative of future performance due to among other things changes in our mix of business repricing of certain lines of business or any number of economic cyclical effects on our business reserves whether calculated under gaap or statutory accounting principles do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions there can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances future loss development may require reserves to be increased which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods life expectancies may continue to increase which could lengthen the time a claimant receives disability or longterm care benefits and could result in a change in mortality assumptions and an increase in reserves for these and other longtailed products adjustments to reserve amounts may also be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity the incidence of claims and the rate of recovery including the effects thereon of inflation and other societal and economic factors premium rate increases persistency policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  19see reserves for policy and contract benefits contained herein in item 1 executive summary and critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion unfavorable economic conditions may result in lower sales lower premium growth and persistency higher claims incidence and longer claims duration which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionwe are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the general economy both in the united states the united kingdom and to a lesser extent the broader global financial markets negative developments in the capital markets andor the general economy could adversely affect our business and results of operations in particular factors such as unemployment levels consumer confidence levels consumer spending business investment government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and ultimately the amount and profitability of our businesses given the nature of our products in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower personal income reduced consumer spending and lower corporate earnings and investment new product sales may be adversely affected our premium growth may also be negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy in addition during such periods we may experience higher claims incidence longer claims duration andor an increase in policy lapses any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation which may affect the cost or demand for our products increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and adversely affect our profitability liquidity or growth our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the united states and abroad the primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders not stockholders to that end applicable laws establish regulatory authorities including state insurance departments in the united states and the pra in the united kingdom with broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business for example our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses permits authorizations or accreditations or may be able to do so only at great cost in addition we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with or obtain appropriate exemptions from the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly reexamined existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations for example they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us restrict transactions between subsidiaries andor between us and our subsidiaries and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationsit is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate we cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted or what impact if any such proposals or if enacted such laws could have on our business results of operations or financial condition the naic or state regulators may adopt revisions to the rbc formula the pra may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins the iais may adopt capital requirements to which we could be subject or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries increased financial services regulation which could include activities undertaken by the naic and the european commission may impose greater quantitative requirements supervisory review and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies capital requirements and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries the united kingdoms financial ombudsman service which was established to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses providing financial services and the fca which has rulemaking investigative and enforcement powers to protect consumers may hamper our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our uk operations programs such as healthcare reform and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace the united states social security disability insurance program may not be sustainable which may adversely affect the level of our disability claim payments and reserves 20we use affiliated captive reinsurers for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency if we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurers or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangements our ability to maintain current rbc ratios andor our capital deployment activities could be adversely affectedlegislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability changes in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes furthermore the value of deferred tax assets could be impacted by our future earnings levels changes in tax laws could also make some of our products less attractive to consumers we cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether if at all any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations doddfrank directs existing and recently created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years as a result of the regulations implemented thus far regulations directed at some derivative activities and the implementation of central clearing rules have increased the cost of some hedging activities primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements we cannot predict the requirements of the remaining regulations that will ultimately be adopted or how or whether such regulations will affect our businesses results of operations cash flows or financial condition require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings most group longterm and shortterm disability plans we administer are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa changes to erisa enacted by congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans increase the premiums associated with such plans and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitabilitythe insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates andor benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees these regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices are improper these actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material

adversely affect our defense of various lawsuits see regulation contained herein in item 1 and notes 7 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionin addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditydefault riskour investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities these securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer a regulatory change pertaining to the issuers industry a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the issuer widening risk spreads ratings downgrades a change in the issuers marketplace or business prospects or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations  21our mortgage loan portfolio has default risk events or developments such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents or limit the availability of refinancing may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector a default results in the recognition of an impairment loss on the investment a default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us the probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience periods of volatility and illiquidity credit spread riskour exposure to credit spreads which is the yield above comparable us treasury securities primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads a widening of credit spreads may unfavorably impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of the investment portfolio and may adversely impact liquidity credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities valuation riskwe report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at fair value valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation particularly during periods of market disruption resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold further rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments there can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken additional impairments may need to be taken in the future and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionmarket timing and liquidity riskwhile we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business there may at times be a lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired in addition we may in certain circumstances need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs there may also be a limited market for certain of our investments such as our private placement fixed maturity securities mortgage loans and policy loans which makes them more illiquid in periods of market volatility or disruption other of our securities may also experience reduced liquidity if events occur wherein we need to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or credit environment or need to quickly sell securities which are illiquid market prices may be lower than what we might realize under normal circumstances with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see critical accounting estimates included in managements

for further discussion of our investments and derivatives a cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data damage our reputation or relationships and expose us to significant financial and legal liability which may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe store confidential policyholder and employee information and other proprietary information on our information technology systems as a part of our normal business operations although we devote significant resources to maintain security systems and implement measures to protect our information technology systems and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information retained on them and to date have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity there is no assurance that these systems and measures will be sufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering we have contractual and governance safeguards in place with our thirdparty outsourcing partners and cloud computing providers to manage security as part of the service they deliver to us but these measures may not prevent attackers from exploiting weaknesses in their networks to access  22misappropriate alter or delete our data threats to our systems or those of thirdparty providers may originate externally such as from cyber criminals or other hackers or internally from within our company such as from employee error or malfeasance in some cases especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched we may be unaware of emerging threats and the magnitude of their effects or we may not become aware of an unauthorized data disclosure incident for some time after it occurs which could increase our exposure as we increase the amount of information that we retain and that we share with third parties our exposure to data security and related cybersecurity risks increasesa successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information systems could cause serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information retained on those systems harm to our reputation decreased levels of customer service or satisfaction violations of applicable privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation or enforcement proceedingswhile we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides coverage for network security privacy liability technology errors and omissions media liability first party network business interruption and electronic restoration which includes coverage for credit monitoring notification costs regulatory expense and investigative expense our insurance may not provide adequate loss coverage in all circumstancesthe failure of our business

operations or financial condition in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an epidemic a cyber attack cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure a terrorist attack or war unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data in addition in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised the failure of our information technology andor disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers operations and result in the loss theft or failure to maintain the security confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data including personal information relating to our customers such a failure could harm our reputation subject us to regulatory sanctions legal claims and increased expenses and lead to a loss of customers and revenues  competition may adversely affect our market share or profitability all of our businesses are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength and claimspaying ratings we compete for new product sales the retention of existing business and the ability to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products all of which affect our profitability we are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and nontraditional competitors with changes in product offerings enrollment approaches and technology solutions the level and intensity of competition may also grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result in larger competitors with greater financial resources there are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business and there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future see competition contained herein in item 1 for further discussionthe failure to effectively execute upgrades to or replacements of information technology systems could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe rely heavily on the effective operation of our information technology systems to administer our business although we believe we have information technology systems which adequately support our business needs we continually upgrade our existing information technology systems and acquire or develop new systems to keep pace with the rapidly changing business and technology environment there are risks involved with upgrading or replacing information technology systems including but not limited to data loss data errors and disruption to our operations we seek to monitor and control our exposure to the risks arising out of these activities through our risk control framework which encompasses a variety of reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms  23a decrease in our financial strength or issuer credit ratings may adversely affect our competitive position our ability to hedge our risks and our cost of capital or ability to raise capital which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditywe compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies a downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially among other things adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force negatively impact persistency and new sales and generally adversely affect our ability to compete a downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to unum group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital if we are downgraded significantly ratings triggers in our derivatives financial instrument contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the derivative contracts such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks see ratings contained herein in item 1 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 for further discussionevents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionthere are many events which may harm our reputation including but not limited to those discussed in this item 1a regarding regulatory investigations legal proceedings and cyber or other information security incidents in addition as an insurance company we are paid to accept certain risks those who conduct our business including executive officers and members of management sales managers investment professionals and to some extent independent agents and brokers do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk these include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities delivering effective technology solutions complying with established sales practices executing our capital management strategy exiting a line of business andor pursuing strategic growth initiatives and other decisions although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective if our employees and business associates take excessive risks andor fail to comply with internal policies and practices the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation depending on the severity of the damage to our reputation we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital andor increase our cost of capital see regulation contained herein in item 1 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on regulatory matters and legal proceedingswe provide a broad array of disability longterm care group life and voluntary insurance products that are affected by many factors and changes in any of those factors may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity disability insurancedisability insurance may be affected by a number of social economic governmental competitive and other factors changes in societal attitudes such as work ethic motivation or stability can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products both economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies the relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price underwrite and adjudicate the claims  24within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates however these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time the pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes our individual noncancelable disability policies in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium do not permit us to adjust premiums on our inforce business guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market longterm care insurancelongterm care insurance can be affected by a number of demographic medical economic governmental competitive and other factors because longterm care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is longduration in nature there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products this creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves longterm care insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but the repricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside the rate approval process can affect the length of time in which the repricing can be implemented if at all and the rate increases ultimately approved may be favorable or unfavorable relative to assumptions used to establish our reserves we monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity mortality and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves mortality continues to improve for the general population and life expectancy has increased which could lengthen the time a claimant receives longterm care benefits and may subject more policyholders to advanced aging and an associated increase in claims incidence medical advances may continue to have an impact on claim incidence and duration both favorable and unfavorable due to the long duration of the product the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities sustained periods of low or declining interest rates could result in increases in reserves and adversely affect our results of operations group life insurancegroup life insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily our risk selection process our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics the geographical concentration of employees and mortality rates claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks natural disasters and pandemic health events which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage voluntary productsvoluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect our risk selection process and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics our voluntary life insurance products generally include interest sensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate it is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate the nonlife contracts are guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products see reserves for policy and contract benefits contained herein in item 1 and executive summary and critical accounting estimates

unidentified or unanticipated risk which could negatively affect our businesswe have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program which has the objective of managing our strategic market credit insurance and operations risks which ultimately impact our reputational risk however our program may not be comprehensive and our methods for monitoring and managing risk may not fully predict or mitigate future exposures see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained herein in item 7a for further information about our risk management program  25litigation and contingencies are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses andor harm to our reputation  we are and in the future may be defendants in a number of litigation matters and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive and treble damages an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated an adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may depending on the nature scope and amount of the ruling materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition encourage other litigation and limit our ability to write new business particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratingsas part of our normal operations in managing claims we are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages may from time to time have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive lossessee critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on legal proceedingsreinsurance may not be available or affordable or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionas part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various businesses market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance reduce our results of operations accordingly we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which may adversely affect our ability to write future business result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue and increase our capital requirements the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers we cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the effectiveness of our hedging programs may be affected by changes in the economic environment changes in interest rates capital market volatility nonperformance by our counterparties changes in the level of required collateral or regulation which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity we use derivative financial instruments to help us manage certain risks related to our business operations primarily interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities and foreign currency risk factors associated with derivative financial instruments could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity ineffectiveness of our hedges due to changes in expected future events such as the risk created by uncertainty in the economic environment or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of nonperformance by our counterparties many of which are financial institutions nonperformance by our counterparties may force us to unwind hedges and we may be unable to replace the hedge thereby leaving the risk unhedged under the terms of our hedging contracts we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral which may adversely affect our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute hedging strategies due to the increased economic cost of derivatives primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements  26changes in accounting standards may materially affect our financial statementsour financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the united states and the united kingdom which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the us financial accounting standards board fasb the uk accounting standards board asb and the naic accounting standards issued by the fasb and asb may be influenced by the international accounting standards board iasb these authoritative bodies have several ongoing projects regarding accounting standards that will likely be issued in the near future future accounting standards we adopt will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition currency translation could materially impact our reported operating resultsthe functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk our ability to finance our ongoing operations may not always be possible solely from internal sources of capital and liquidity if we need to seek external capital there is the risk that adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital or our cost of capitala change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations deterioration in the credit market which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner could also negatively impact our cash flows regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this item 1a may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries increase collateral requirements for certain of our derivatives transactions andor implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity without sufficient liquidity our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms or at all which may adversely affect us if our financial results are unfavorable we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the us the pra in the uk and the rating agencies that rate insurers claimspaying abilities and financial strength failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by the rating agencies need for additional capital may limit a subsidiarys ability to distribute funds to our holding companiesobtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty the markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers the availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in unum group we rely on our credit facility as a potential source of liquidity our right to borrow funds under this facility is subject to financial covenants negative covenants and events of default our ability to borrow under this facility is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders to provide funds our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facility or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments would restrict our ability to access this facility when needed with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see liquidity and capital resources included in managements

not perform well or as initially anticipated in our assumptions we may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment loss on intangible assets or longlived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset we have intangible assets such as deferred acquisition costs dac value of business acquired voba and goodwill dac and voba are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies recoverability testing for dac and voba is performed on an annual basis insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring servicing and measuring profitability of the contracts if recoverability testing indicates that either dac andor voba are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense goodwill is not amortized but on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors in accordance with accounting guidance we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below in addition certain events including but not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually longlived assets including assets such as real estate and information technology software also require impairment testing to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we may be unable to recover the carrying amount we assess our deferred tax assets to determine if they are realizable factors in our determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income if based on available information it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to net income charges such as accelerated amortization impairment losses or the establishment of valuation allowances could

within the us and abroad ongoing military actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility in the global financial markets and result in loss of life property damage business disruption and reduced economic activity some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism terrorist actions also could disrupt our operations centers in the us or abroad in addition the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated beyond obtaining insurance coverage for our facilities there are few if any commercial options through which to transfer the exposure from extreme events away from us we purchase reinsurance protection against catastrophic disaster events including terrorism the continued threat of terrorism could result in increased
