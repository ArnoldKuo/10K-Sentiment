other insurance companies in a reinsurance transaction a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium the primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to limit losses from large exposures however if the assuming reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations we remain contingently liable we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure we may also require assets to be held in trust letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances in general the maximum amount of risk retained by our us insurance subsidiaries and not ceded is 750000 per covered life per

overseas entities with equivalent ratings or backed by letters of credit or trust agreements or through reinsurance arrangements wherein we retain the assets in our general account the remaining one percent of our reinsurance recoverable is held by companies either rated below a by am best or not ratedthe collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers although we have controls to minimize our exposure the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsfor further discussion of our reinsurance activities refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a and notes 1 and 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 reserves for policy and contract benefitsthe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report as liabilities policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies these reserves are the amounts which with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables interest rates and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries these differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods the assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable if actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions additional reserves may be required the key experience assumptions include disability claim incidence rates disability claim recovery rates mortality rates policy persistency interest rates and policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred as we believe appropriatethe consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits the change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses deaths and benefit payments if policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits for further discussion of reserves refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a critical accounting estimates and the discussion of segment operating results included in

item 8 9investmentsinvestment activities are an integral part of our business and profitability is significantly affected by investment results we segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines generally our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses we seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner subject to constraints of quality liquidity diversification and regulatory considerations our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk we may redistribute investments among our different lines of business when necessary to adjust the cash flow andor duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes we use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a critical accounting estimates and the discussion of investments in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

types of products we sell we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength and claimspaying ratings in the individual and group disability markets we compete in the united states with a limited number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products our principal competitors for our other products including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction include the largest insurance companies in the united states some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claimspaying ratings some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete in the united kingdom we compete for the individual and group products we sell with a number of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers these providers have been aggressively trying to maintain market share in a difficult economic environment characterized by very low interest rates and expense pressures on employers and individuals however current penetration levels indicate that there is still significant upside growth potential in the united kingdom for the types of products we offer all areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market there is a risk that purchasers of employee benefits products may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us the effect of competition may as a result adversely affect the persistency of these and other products as well as our ability to sell products in the futurewe must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers we compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings financial strength support services and compensation sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokersfor further discussion refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1aregulation  generalwe and our

insurance laws which require they establish and carry as liabilities statutory reserves to meet policyholder obligations these reserves are verified periodically by various regulators our domestic insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by examiners from their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business the domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing such as market conduct issues other states more typically perform market conduct examinations that include a review of a companys sales practices including advertising and licensing of agents and brokers as well as underwriting claims customer service and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws our domestic insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers capital requirementsriskbased capital rbc standards for us life insurance companies have been prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic the domiciliary states of our us insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the rbc model formula of the naic which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers the basis of the system is a riskbased formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurers business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer the life and health rbc formula is designed to measure annually i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks the formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized the formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally the naics solvency modernization initiative smi began in june 2008 the smi is a selfexamination of the united states insurance solvency regulation framework and includes a review of international developments regarding insurance supervision banking supervision and international accounting standards and their potential use in us insurance regulation the smi is a wideranging initiative that by its nature will evolve to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments current smi goals and the principles developed through the smis exploration of capital requirements governance and risk management group supervision statutory accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance will likely result in significant changes to us insurance regulation and solvency standards including those for our us insurance subsidiaries progress on the various initiatives is expected to continue throughout 2013 although the naic has made progress with some legislation effective dates are uncertain as the legislation is subject to adoption of enabling legislation by individual states which has not yet occurredunum limited is subject to regulation including capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins by the fsa in the uk current solvency standards require an insurance company to hold capital equal to the greater of i a formulaic calculation of capital related to liabilities or ii a riskbased assessment of capital which is company specific reflecting the insurance companys individual risk profile solvency ii a european union directive that will prescribe new capital requirements and risk management standards that are the result of a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the european insurance industry will replace the current capital requirements for unum limited our european holding company will also be subject to the solvency ii requirements relevant to insurance holding companies and its subsidiaries including unum limited will be subject to group supervision under solvency ii solvency ii requirements have not been fully finalized but the current proposals contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers including i requirements to demonstrate adequate financial resources including quantitative requirements technical provisions and calculation of solvency ii capital requirements through either an approved full or partial internal model or the european standard formula approach ii requirements to demonstrate an adequate system of governance including effective risk management underpinned by prospective risk identification and quantification and iii disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements although the regulatory timetable remains uncertain the effective adoption date is expected to be no earlier than january 1 2015 the impact of solvency ii on our uk subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time but its implementation could result in increased capital supervisory and disclosure requirements 12our bermudabased insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation by the bermuda monetary authority bma over the past few years the bma has been engaged in a comprehensive

regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled which currently include maine massachusetts tennessee south carolina new york vermont and california these laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system including information concerning capital structure ownership management financial condition and certain intercompany transactions transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and if material require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulatorin addition such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders including our company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources  cash available from subsidiaries contained herein in item 7there are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect us and our insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level although these changes are only beginning to be adopted by individual state regulators it can be expected that most will ultimately adopt them in some form the various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate governance groupwide supervision of insurance holding companies adjustments to rbc calculations to account for groupwide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies a completed activity within the smi includes the recent adoption by the naic of the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act and the own risk and solvency assessment orsa guidance manual which require insurers to provide a grouplevel perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks we expect to file our orsa summary report with the applicable insurance regulators in 2015the laws of most states including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company where these laws apply to us there can be no effective change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change the usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company although this presumption is rebuttable consequently a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the states of domicile of the insurance companyies sought to be acquired or whose holding company is sought to be acquired will be in violation of these laws such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions i injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the applicable insurance regulators ii prohibition of voting of such shares and iii other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators further many states insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a nondomiciled insurance company doing business in the state these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control however they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted prenotification laws these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of our company including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 13federal laws and regulations in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform
