consolidated financial statements of unum group and its subsidiaries the company have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap such accounting principles differ from statutory accounting principles see note 14 intercompany transactions have been eliminated description of business we are the largest provider of group and individual disability products in the united states and the united kingdom we also provide a complementary portfolio of other insurance products including life insurance employer and employeepaid group benefits and other related services we market our products primarily to employers interested in providing benefits to their employees we have three major business segments unum us unum uk and colonial life our other reporting segments are closed block and corporate see note 12 for further discussion of our operating segments use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed hereinfixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include longterm bonds and redeemable preferred stocks fixed maturity securities not bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term but for which we do not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value changes in the fair value of availableforsale fixed maturity securities except for amounts related to otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings are reported as a component of other comprehensive income these amounts are net of income tax and valuation adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realizedinterest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount included within fixed maturity securities are mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income for fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when receivedin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate available information both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions although available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security see also notes 2 and 3 mortgage loans mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received 105notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedwe use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for further inspection analysis and reevaluation for mortgage loans on which collection of investment income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income in the period when an interest payment is received we typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower we consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan mortgage loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and considering the underlying collateral the value of which is periodically assessed additions and reductions to our allowance are reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss we do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments see also note 3policy loans policy loans are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate included in policy loans are 29127 million and 28383 million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively other longterm investments other longterm investments are comprised primarily of freestanding derivatives with a positive fair value tax credit partnerships and private equity partnerships freestanding derivatives are more fully described in the derivatives accounting policy which followstax credit partnerships in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal the primary sources of investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment these partnerships are accounted for using either the equity or the effective yield method depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of credit a tax indemnity agreement or another similar arrangement tax credits received from these partnerships are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of state premium taxes which are a component of other expenses or a reduction of income tax for those partnerships accounted for under the equity method the amortization of the principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of net investment income for those partnerships accounted for under the effective yield method amortization of the principal amount invested is reported as a component of income tax or other expensesour investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature the underlying investments held by these partnerships include both equity and debt securities and are accounted for using the equity or cost method depending on the level of ownership and the degree of our influence over partnership operating and financial policies for partnerships accounted for under the equity method our portion of partnership earnings is reported as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of income for those partnerships accounted for under the cost method we record income received from partnership distributions as either a component of net investment income or of net realized investment gain or loss in accordance with the source of the funds distributed from the partnership shortterm investments shortterm investments are carried at cost shortterm investments include investments maturing within one year such as corporate commercial paper and us treasury bills bank term deposits and other cash accounts and cash equivalents earning interestcash and bank deposits cash and bank deposits include cash on hand and noninterest bearing cash and deposit accounts derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging transaction we formally document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instruments effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure 106notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedineffectiveness a derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risks of the hedged item hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship using qualitative and quantitative methods qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship for those derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the derivative is designated based upon the exposure being hedged as one of the followingfair value hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative including amounts measured as ineffectiveness and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge is recognized in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss when interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged itemscash flow hedge to the extent it is effective changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earningsgains or losses on the termination of ineffective hedges are reported in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedge out of accumulated other comprehensive income into current earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item our freestanding derivatives all qualify as hedges and have been designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges we do not have any speculative positions in our freestanding derivatives for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument the change in fair value is recognized in earnings during the period of change changes in the fair values of certain embedded derivatives are reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of changein our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreementsfair value measurement all of our fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value our derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities which are also reported at fair value we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach the income approach and the cost approach we use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available in some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate in other cases multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value we evaluate and weigh the results as appropriate considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances107notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedthe selection of the valuation methods to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach inputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstanceswe prioritize the inputs to fair valuation techniques and use unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available we categorize our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a threelevel hierarchy based on the significance of the inputs the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 see also note 2 realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income as applicable otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income deferred acquisition costs incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts have been deferred such costs include commissions other agency compensation certain selection and policy issue expenses and certain field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing in subsequent yearsdeferred acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur generally the amortization periods for these policies approximate the estimated lives of the policiesdeferred acquisition costs related to interestsensitive policies are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins adjustments are made to reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to anticipated experienceinternal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred internal replacement transactions principally on group contracts that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs 108notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedloss recognition is generally performed on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as to future experience as of the date of the test insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense goodwill goodwill is the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the fair values of the reporting units are determined using discounted cash flow models the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings and the discount rate we set our discount rate assumption based on an expected risk adjusted cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the unamortized goodwill the carrying amount is reduced with a corresponding charge to expense property and equipment property and equipment is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation which is calculated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life the accumulated depreciation for property and equipment was 7050 million and 6709 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectivelyvalue of business acquired value of business acquired represents the present value of future profits recorded in connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies the asset is amortized based upon expected future premium income for traditional insurance policies and estimated future gross profits for interestsensitive insurance policies the value of business acquired which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets was 235 million and 303 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the accumulated amortization for value of business acquired was 1315 million and 1193 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the amortization of value of business acquired which is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income was 75 million 74 million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we periodically review the carrying amount of value of business acquired using the same methods used to evaluate deferred acquisition costs policy and contract benefits policy and contract benefits represent amounts paid and expected to be paid based on reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses for traditional life and accident and health products for interestsensitive products benefits are the amounts paid and expected to be paid on insured claims in excess of the policyholders policy fund balancespolicy and contract benefits liabilities policy reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims not yet incurred policy reserves for traditional life and accident and health products are determined using the net level premium method the reserves are calculated based upon assumptions as to interest persistency morbidity and mortality that were appropriate at the date of issue interest rate assumptions are based on actual and expected net investment returns persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations morbidity and mortality assumptions are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations the assumptions vary by plan year of issue and policy duration and include a provision for adverse deviationpolicy reserves for group single premium annuities have been provided on a net single premium method the reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to interest mortality and retirement that were appropriate at the date of issue mortality assumptions are based upon industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations the assumptions vary by year of issuepolicy reserves for interestsensitive products are principally policyholder account values109notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedwe perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency claim reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us our claim reserves relate primarily to disability policies and are calculated based on assumptions as to interest and claim resolution

effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes have been measured using enacted statutory income tax rates and laws that are currently in effect we record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely

maturities loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations these financial instruments are assigned a level 2 within the fair value hierarchy policy loans fair values for policy loans net of reinsurance ceded are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered to policyholders with similar policies carrying amounts

are assigned a level 3 within the fair value hierarchy miscellaneous longterm investments carrying amounts for tax credit partnerships equal the unamortized balance of our contractual commitments and

consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contractslongterm debt fair values for longterm debt are obtained from independent pricing services or discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements debt instruments which are valued using active trades from independent pricing services for which there was current market activity in that specific debt instrument have a fair value of 12120 million at december 31 2012 and are assigned a level 1 within the fair value hierarchy debt instruments which are valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques have a fair value of 17568 million at december 31 2012 and are assigned a level 2 unfunded

2 within the fair value hierarchy117notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continued fair value measurements for financial instruments carried at fair valuewe report fixed maturity securities derivative financial instruments and equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available conversely financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditionsvaluation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or the current replacement costwe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort in some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities in other cases multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value we evaluate and weigh the results as appropriate considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstancesthe selection of the valuation methods to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the type of investments we hold our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs when using a pricing service we obtain the vendors pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies we periodically review and approve the selection of our pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies when markets are less active brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker our internal investment management professionals which include portfolio managers and analysts monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions we also consider the nature of the quote particularly whether the quote is a binding offer if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value when relevant market data is unavailable which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty the income approach can in suitable circumstances provide a more appropriate fair value during 2012 we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2011118notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continued we use observable and

management of our investment portfolio includes establishing pricing policy and reviewing the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a securitys price in the event we receive a vendors market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security we may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade we also review all price changes from the prior month which fall outside a predetermined corridor the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price these adjustments may be made when in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument the market in which the financial instrument is traded counterparty credit risk credit structure concentration or liquidity additionally an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument in the event an asset is sold we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting period closest to the transaction datethe parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies rather the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditionsfair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the london interbank offered rate libor setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values if net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the liborbased fair value obtained from our pricing sources we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources for purposes of valuing net counterparty risk we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions in regard to our own credit risk component we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the liborbased valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk 119notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continued fair

liabilities interest rate risk and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangementcertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors

similar assets absent current market activity when only one price is available it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate these assets for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data were classified as level 2approximately 138 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities matrix

categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data level 3 is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date financial assets and liabilities categorized as level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to

gain of 70762 million and a gross unrealized loss of 234 million the gross unrealized loss on investmentgrade fixed maturity securities was 418 percent of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities unrealized losses on investmentgrade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred

gross unrealized loss of 326 million the gross unrealized loss on belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities was 582 percent of the total gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities generally belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns than investmentgrade securities at december 31 2012 the unrealized losses in our belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities were generally due to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and to a lesser extent credit concerns related to specific securities for each specific security in an unrealized loss position we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded an otherthantemporary impairment will recover in valueas of december 31 2012 we held 45 individual investmentgrade fixed maturity securities and 29 individual belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position of which 16 investmentgrade fixed maturity securities and 18 belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one yearin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate the following factorswhether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securitywhether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basiswhether the security is current as to principal and interest paymentsthe significance of the decline in valuethe time period during which there has been a significant decline in valuecurrent and future business prospects and trends of

the related security128notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 3  investments  continuedwe evaluate available information including the factors noted above both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we also consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and near term funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a securitywhile determining otherthantemporary impairments is a judgmental area we utilize a formal welldefined and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an otherthantemporary impairmentif we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income as applicable for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we have not recognized an otherthantemporary impairment we believe we will recover the entire amortized cost we do not intend to sell the security and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost there have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any securities for which we have not recorded an otherthantemporary impairmentotherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition the determination of cash flows is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security the timing and amount of our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer including its current and projected liquidity position we also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts sector credit ratings future business prospects and earnings trends issuer refinancing capabilities actual andor potential asset sales by the issuer and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security we take into account the probability of default expected recoveries third party guarantees quality of collateral and where our debt security ranks in terms of subordination we may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the present value of cash flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income129notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and

fair value of the underlying collateral if we expect to retain the mortgage loan until payoff the allowance equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the expected future cash flows of

unaffiliated financial institutions we generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for shortterm general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days we post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later specified date the fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash receivedour investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements these agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be maintained as collateral generally cash is received as collateral under these agreements and is typically reinvested in shortterm investments in the event that securities are received as collateral we are not permitted to sell or repost themwe account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings as of december 31 2012 the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third

financial instrumentspurpose of derivativeswe are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities and foreign currency risk historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities hedging transactions are primarily associated with our individual and group longterm care and individual and group disability products all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes135notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 4  derivative financial instrumentsour cash flow hedging programs are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities an interest rate swap is an agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts the purpose of these swaps is to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate longterm debtforeign currency interest rate swaps have historically been used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification and to hedge the currency risk associated with certain of the interest payments and debt repayments of the us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries for hedges of fixed maturity securities we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment for hedges of debt issued we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments to the counterparty in exchange for fixed rate us dollardenominated interest paymentsforward treasury locks are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity securities a forward treasury lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific us treasury bond at a future date at a predetermined priceforeign currency forward contracts are used to minimize foreign currency risks a foreign currency forward is a derivative without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to exchange a specific amount of currencies at a specific exchange rate on a specific date we have used these forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the debt repayments of the us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries and to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for diversification purposesour fair value hedging programs are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund our floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest additionally we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate longterm debt into floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interestderivative risksthe basic types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market primarily the change in interest and exchange rates and credit risk that the counterparty will not perform according to the terms of the contract the market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability136notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 4  derivative financial instruments  continuedto help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held was 87 million at december 31 2012 we held no cash collateral from our counterparties as of december 31 2012 we held cash collateral of 456 million from our counterparties as of december 31 2011 this unrestricted cash collateral is included in shortterm investments and the associated obligation to return the collateral to our counterparties is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets we post either fixed maturity securities or cash as collateral to our counterparties the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 1086 million and 1149 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we had 18 million cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2012 we had no cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2011the majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings should our ratings fall below these specified levels we would be in violation of the provisions and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a liability

our average reserve discount rate used during 2012 2011 and 2010we generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year but more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test included in our analysis for the longterm care product line during the fourth quarter of 2011 was a review of our reserve discount rate mortality and morbidity assumptions our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in longterm interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve boards actions including the announcement of operation twist we also considered an updated industry study for longterm care experience which was made available midyear 2011 from the society of actuaries our analysis of this study which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience based on our analysis as of december 31 2011 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates we also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience while our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2011 we determined that deferred acquisition costs of 1960 million as adjusted for the january 1 2012 retrospective adoption of the accounting standards update related to deferred acquisition costs were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by 5736 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations of this amount 2481 million was related to claim reserves and approximately 2150 million can be attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart 142notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and

reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business we are now able with a higher degree of confidence to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible there is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered these benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age longer duration disabled claimants which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits as a result of this experience as of december 31 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and as a result increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by 1835 million of this amount approximately 1760 million can be attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart incurred related to prior years  all other incurred for 2012 was generally consistent with the level of 2011 excluding the 2011 reserve charges discussed in the preceding paragraphs throughout the period 2010 to 2012 we had generally stable to improving claims management performance and our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our longterm assumptions our claims management performance during 2012 for unum us group longterm disability exceeded our longterm assumptions for claim resolution rates for the closed block individual disability and longterm care lines of business the claims management performance in 2012 was consistent with the level of 2011 our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation

settlement of 604 million in 2012during 2010 the irs completed its examination of tax years 2005 and 2006 and issued a revenue agents report rar in 2011 we filed a protest to the rar with respect to all significant adverse proposed adjustments in 2012 we reached a tentative settlement with irs appeals for these years and expect to receive final approval of the settlement in 2013 with no material impact on our results of operations or financial conditiontax years subsequent to 2008 remain subject to examination by tax authorities in the us and tax years subsequent to 2009 remain subject to examination in major foreign jurisdictions we believe sufficient provision has been made for all potential adjustments for years that are not closed by the statute of limitations in all major tax jurisdictions and that any such adjustments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations 146notes to consolidated financial statements

benefit plans at the measurement date to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the projected cash flows for future benefits  our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is an estimate based on statistical analysis of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the plan assets until current benefits are paid the marketrelated value equals the fair value of assets determined as of the measurement date our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories were based on a combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economiststhe methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as longterm rates of return volatility of returns and the correlation of returns between various asset classes the expected return for the total portfolio was calculated based on the plans strategic asset allocation investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and

compensation increase assumption is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trendsfor measurement purposes at december 31 2012 and 2011 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year was 800 percent and 850 percent respectively for benefits payable to both retirees prior to medicare eligibility as well as medicare eligible retirees the rate was assumed to change gradually to 500 percent by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter the medical and dental premium used to determine the per retiree

postretirement benefit obligation by 39 million and 29 million respectivelyour opeb plan currently receives a subsidy from the federal government under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the medicare act this act allows an employer to choose whether to coordinate prescription drug benefits under a retiree medical plan with the medicare prescription drug benefit or to keep the company plan design as it is and receive a subsidy from the federal government when the medicare act became effective in 2006 we initially elected to receive the subsidy from the federal government with plans to defer our coordination with the new prescription drug benefit until a later date this anticipated change was reflected in the net periodic benefit cost in 2009 we amended the plan design to stop the deferral of coordination of benefits and elected to continue receiving the existing subsidy from the federal government this election resulted in a 44 million prior service credit that began amortization in 2010 we received subsidy payments of 13 million in both 2012 and 2011 our expected benefit payments in future years have been reduced by the amount of subsidy payments we expect to receive the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be amortized and included in net periodic pension cost during 2013 is 598 million before tax and 391 million after tax the prior service credit expected to be amortized and included as a reduction to net periodic cost for our opeb plan during

policy for our us qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute annually an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under erisa and other applicable laws but generally not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes we had no regulatory contribution requirements for our us qualified plan for 2012 and 2011 however we elected to make a voluntary contribution of 530 million in 2012 and expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately 500 million during 2013 the funding policy for our us nonqualified defined benefit pension plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year our expected return on plan assets and discount rate will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements required under erisa we contribute to our uk plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least 248 percent of pensionable salaries for active members of the plan plus 04 percent of pensionable salaries for all employees including active members of the plan who are entitled to lump sum death in service benefits under the plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation we made contributions of 41

nonvested nonguaranteed obligation and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits which are comprised of retiree life medical and dental benefits it is our practice

financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of beforetax realized investment gains and losses and nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses we previously allocated the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses the component of the net periodic benefit costs for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans which we consider to be nonoperating to our corporate segment effective january 1 2012 we modified our segment reporting such that the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses is no longer included in operating income or operating loss by segment prior period segment results for our corporate segment have been adjusted to conform to current year reportingwe measure segment performance excluding realized investment gains and losses and nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses we believe operating income or loss which excludes the specified items listed in our reconciliation is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities certain components of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans namely the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses are primarily driven by market performance and are not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income by segment provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and will increase or decrease over time depending on market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans the exclusion of these items from segment performance does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitabilitya reconciliation of total operating revenue and operating income by segment to revenue and net income as

at december 31 2012 and may or may not be funded during the term of the investments contingent liabilities we are a defendant in a number of litigation matters in some of these matters no specified amount is sought in others very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive and treble damages are asserted there is a wide variation of pleading practice permitted in the united states courts with respect to requests for monetary damages including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court further some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts based on our extensive experience and that of others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of the case or the likely disposition value therefore the specific monetary relief sought is not stated unless indicated otherwise in the descriptions below reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated claims handling matters we and our insurance subsidiaries in the ordinary course of our business are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our consolidated financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could from time to time have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period depending on the results of operations for the particular period 169notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 13  commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedfrom time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated since each insurance claim is evaluated based on its own merits there is rarely a single act or series of actions which can properly be addressed by a class action nevertheless we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are mademiscellaneous matters in september 2008 we received service of a complaint in an adversary proceeding in connection with the bankruptcy case in re quebecor world usa inc et al entitled official committee of unsecured creditors of quebecor world usa inc et al v american united life insurance company et al filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the complaint alleges that we received preference payments relating to notes held by certain of our insurance subsidiaries and seeks to avoid and recover such payments plus interest and cost of the action in july 2011 the bankruptcy court ruled in our favor granting a summary judgment motion to dismiss the case against us and the other defendants in september 2012 the united states district court for the southern district of new york affirmed the bankruptcy courts decision to dismiss the case in october 2012 the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in october 2010 denise merrimon bobby s mowery and all others similarly situated vs unum life insurance company of america was filed in the united states district court for the district of maine this class action alleges that we breached fiduciary duties owed to certain beneficiaries under certain group life insurance policies when we paid life insurance proceeds by establishing interestbearing retained asset accounts rather than by mailing checks plaintiffs seek to represent a class of beneficiaries under group life insurance contracts that were part of erisa employee welfare benefit plans and under which we paid death benefits via retained asset accounts the plaintiffs principal theories in the case are 1 funds held in retained asset accounts were plan assets and the proceeds earned by us from investing those funds belonged to the beneficiaries and 2 payment of claims using retained asset accounts did not constitute payment under maines late payment statute requiring us to pay interest on the undrawn retained asset account funds at an annual rate of 18 percent in february 2012 the district court issued an opinion rejecting both of plaintiffs principal theories and ordering judgment for us at the same time however the district court held that we breached a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries by failing to pay rates comparable to the best rates available in the market for demand deposits the district court also certified a class of people who during a certain period of time were beneficiaries under certain group life insurance contracts that were part of erisa employee welfare benefit plans and were paid death benefits using retained asset accounts the district court authorized the parties to make an immediate appeal of its decision to the first circuit court of appeals and each of the parties sought leave for an early appeal on the issues raised by the district courts rulings but the first circuit decided not to hear the appeal at this time therefore the parties are required to wait until the proceedings in the district court have concluded for further resolution of those issues the first circuit did not rule on or discuss the merits of the case the case is proceeding in the district court where notice to class members and discovery on the issue of damages have been completed in february 2013 we filed a motion requesting the court reconsider its prior summary judgment ruling as well as a motion challenging the admissibility of the testimony of plaintiffs expert witness in march 2011 we received a request for information from an independent third party as part of an examination on behalf of 32 states and the district of columbia to evaluate our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states industrywide practices are currently under review concerning the identification and handling of unclaimed property by insurers and numerous other insurers are under similar examination we are cooperating fully with this examinationin july 2011 the new york state department of financial services issued a special request to approximately 160 insurers including unum groups new york licensed insurance subsidiaries which requires the insurers to crosscheck their life insurance policies annuity contracts and retained asset accounts with the latest version of the social security master death index to identify any matches insurers are also requested to investigate the matches to determine if death benefits are due to locate the beneficiaries and to make payments where appropriate we accrued an estimated loss contingency in the fourth quarter of 2011 the amount of which was immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we completed our review during the first quarter of 2012 the estimated loss contingency which we established in the fourth quarter of 2011 was sufficient 170notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 13  commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedit is possible other state jurisdictions may pursue similar investigations or inquiries or issue directives similar to the new york state department of financial services letter it is possible that the audits and related activity may result in additional payments to beneficiaries the payment of abandoned funds under state law andor administrative penalties we are currently unable to estimate the reasonably possible amount of any additional paymentsin december 2012 state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v provident life and accident insurance company and state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v colonial life amp accident insurance company were filed in the circuit court of putnam county west virginia these two separate complaints allege violations of the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act by failing to identify and report all unclaimed insurance policy proceeds due to be escheated to west virginia the complaints seek to examine company records and assess penalties and costs in an undetermined amountsummaryvarious lawsuits against us in addition to those discussed above have arisen in the normal course of business further state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulationsgiven the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses except if noted in connection with specific matters it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending in part on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period we believe however that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position171notes to consolidated financial
