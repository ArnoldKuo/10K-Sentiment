we are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below as actual results may differ see investments contained herein in item 7 and notes 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk including derivative financial instrument activity interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments derivatives and interestsensitive liabilities fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans and shortterm investments fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds securities issued by government agencies corporate bonds mortgagebacked securities and redeemable preferred stock all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations certain of our financial instruments fixed maturity securities and derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized gain related to these financial instruments but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities conversely a decline in interest rates may increase the net unrealized gain but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments terminate derivative positions determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge other fixed rate investments such as mortgage loans and policy loans are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances respectively rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans carrying amounts for shortterm investments approximate fair value and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investmentswe believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business we may in certain circumstances however need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs although our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk due to the long duration of our longterm care product we may be unable to purchase appropriate assets with cash flows and durations such that the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities sustained periods of low interest rates could result in lower than expected profitability or increases in reserves we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes we use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments we use current and forward interest rate swaps options on forward interest rate swaps and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities92longterm debt is not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets if we modify or replace existing longterm debt instruments at current market rates we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction we believe our debtrelated risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal in the near term we expect that our need for external financing is small but changes in our business could increase our need we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december 31 2012 and 2011 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels the selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an eventthe hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december 31 2012 and 2011 are shown as follows december 31 2012in millions of dollarsnotional amount of derivativesfair valuehypothetical fv  100 bpchange in fvassets    fixed maturity

may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets the corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes except for changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative which is reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss2  the adjustment to reserves and other for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes 93the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgagebacked securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgagebacked securities these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses because we actively manage our investments and liabilities actual changes could be less than those estimated above foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the december 31 2012 and 2011 levels stockholders equity as reported in us dollars as of and for the periods then ended would have been lower by approximately 1095 million and 1079 million respectively assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the actual average exchange rates for 2012 and 2011 segment operating income which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax as reported in us dollars would have decreased approximately 126 million and 188 million respectively for the years then endeddividends paid by unum limited are generally held at our uk finance subsidiary or our uk holding company if these funds are repatriated to our us holding company we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend when converted into us dollars would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries we use current and forward currency swaps to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments see consolidated operating results and unum uk segment contained herein in item 7 for further information concerning foreign currency translation risk management effectively taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our company to facilitate this effort we have a formal enterprise risk management erm program with a framework comprising the following key components  risk culture and governancerisk appetite policyrisk identification and prioritizationrisk and capital modelingrisk management activitiesrisk reportingthrough adherence to the objectives highlighted by the key components of our erm framework we believe we are better positioned to fulfill our corporate mission improve and protect stockholder value and reduce reputational risk94risk culture and governancewe employ a decentralized risk management model under which riskbased decisions are made daily on a local level to achieve longterm success we believe risk management must be the responsibility of all employees the individual and collective decisions of our employees play a key role in successfully managing our overall risk profile we strive for a culture of accountability risk management and strict compliance and we believe these values allow our employees to feel comfortable identifying issues as well as taking ownership for addressing potential problems our risk culture is reinforced by our system of risk governance we employ a multilayered risk control system our three lines of defense model is depicted below 1st line the business 2nd line risk and control

independent review for our third line of risk controlthe board has an active role as a whole and through its committees in overseeing management of our risks the board is responsible for managing strategic risk and regularly reviews information regarding our capital liquidity and operations as well as the risks associated with each and receives an erm report from our cro at least annually or more frequently as appropriate the audit committee of the board is responsible for oversight of our risk management process including financial risk operational risk and any other risk not specifically assigned to another board committee the cro provides a report on our risks and risk management processes to the audit committee of the board at least quarterly the finance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks associated with investments capital and related financial matters the human capital committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks relating to our compensation plans and programs the cro performs an annual risk assessment of our incentive compensation programs to ensure incentive plans are balanced and consistent with the risk levels embedded in our financial and business plans results of this assessment are presented to our human capital committee of the board annually and conclusions from this assessment are reported in our proxy statement the regulatory compliance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks related to regulatory compliance policy and legal matters both current and emerging and whether of a local state federal or international nature while each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks in addition to the risk information it receives directly the executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprisewide risk management program the cro who is a member of the executive risk management committee has primary responsibility for our erm program and is supported by corporate risk committees and by the risk committees of our primary operating segments operating segment risk committees for unum us unum uk colonial life and closed block are responsible for oversight of risks specific to their businesses these committees are responsible for identifying measuring reporting and managing insurance and operational risks within their respective areas consistent with enterprise risk management guidance corporate risk committees oversee the operational global technology services investment and capital management risks on a corporate level risk appetite policyour risk appetite policy describes the types of risks we are willing to take as well as the amount of enterprise risk exposure we deem acceptable in pursuit of our goals with an objective of clearly defining boundaries for our risktaking activities 95the starting point of our philosophy and approach to our erm strategy is our corporate strategy in contrast to many multiline peer companies we do not offer retirement savings traditional medical benefits or property and casualty insurance our corporate strategy is focused on providing group individual and voluntary benefits either as standalone products or combined with other coverages that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers we have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and have over 160 years of experience we believe this combination of focused expertise and extensive experience is a competitive advantage and forms the foundation of our approach to risk management we believe our sound and consistent business practices strong internal compliance program and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently and to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business we take and manage risks to achieve our business and strategic objectives and our risk appetite statement sets boundaries for risktaking activities that link earnings capital and operational processes as well as summarizes our most material risk limits and controls we monitor our risk profile against our established risk tolerance and limits risks falling outside our risk tolerance and limits are reported to the applicable governance group where decisions are made pertaining to acceptance of the risk or implementation of remediation plans or corrective actions as deemed appropriate by that governance grouprisk identification and prioritizationrisk identification and prioritization is an ongoing process whereby we identify and assess our risk positions and exposures including notable risk events additionally we identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us knowing the potential risks we face allows us to monitor and manage their potential effects including adjusting our strategies as appropriate and holding capital levels which provide financial flexibilityrisk committees have primary responsibility for identifying and prioritizing risks within their respective areas in addition we maintain a risk ethics and compliance rec leaders program the goal of the program is to further embed rec management into our culture in a visible and effective manner this group assists with the early identification of issues timely referrals problem solving and communicationindividual employees can report material concerns and identified risks through a variety of options such as discussion with management contacting a rec leader or the erm team or utilizing the companys anonymous hotline and electronic reporting mechanismwe face a wide range of risks and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures for additional information on certain risks that may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1 and risk factors contained herein in item 1arisk and capital modelingwe assess material risks including how they affect us and how individual risks interrelate to provide valuable information to management in order that they may effectively manage our risks we use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess existing and emerging risks and to develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to bothwe utilize stress testing and scenario analysis for risk management and to shape our business financial and strategic planning activities both are key components of our risk appetite policy and play an important role in monitoring assessing managing and mitigating our primary risk exposures in particular stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure assess mitigating actions develop contingency plans and guide decisions around our target capital and liquidity levels for example we periodically perform stress tests on certain categories of assets or liabilities to support development of capital and liquidity risk contingency plans these tests help ensure that we have a buffer to support our operations in uncertain times and financial flexibility to respond to market opportunities stress testing is also central to reserve adequacy testing cash flow testing and asset and liability management in addition we aim to constantly improve our capital modeling techniques and methodologies that are used to determine a level of capital that is commensurate with our risk profile and to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory and rating agency requirements our capital modeling reflects appropriate aggregation of risks and diversification benefits resulting from our mix of products and business units96our internal capital modeling and allocation aids us in making significant business decisions including strategic planning capital management risk limit determination reinsurance purchases hedging activities asset allocation pricing and corporate developmentrisk management activitieswe accept and manage strategic credit and insurance risks in accordance with our corporate strategy investment policy and annual business plans the following fundamental principles are embedded in our risk management efforts across our companywe believe in the benefits of specialization and a focused business strategy we seek profitable risktaking in areas where we have established risk management skills and capabilitieswe seek to manage our exposure to insurance risk through a combination of prudent underwriting with effective risk selection maintaining pricing discipline sound reserving practices and high quality claims management detailed underwriting guidelines and claim policies are tools used to manage our insurance risk exposure we also monitor exposures against internally prescribed limits and we diversify to reduce potential concentration risk and volatilitywe maintain a detailed set of investment policies and guidelines including fundamental credit analysis that are used to manage our credit risk exposure and diversify our risks across asset classes and issuersfinally we foster a risk culture that embeds our corporate values and our code of conduct in our daily operations and preserves our reputation with customers and other key stakeholders we monitor a composite set of operational risk metrics that measure operating effectiveness from the customer perspectiverisk reportingregular internal and external risk reporting is an integral part of our erm framework internally erm reports are a standard part of our quarterly senior management and board meetings the reports summarize our existing and emerging risk exposures as well as report against the tolerances and limits defined by our risk appetite policy externally we are subject to a number of regulatory and rating agency risk examinations and risk reports are often included by 2015 we must comply with the orsa requirements which are intended to become a regular part of reviews of insurers erm programs we believe the orsa will provide strong evidence of the strengths of our erm framework measurement approaches key assumptions utilized in assessing our risks and prospective solvency assessments under both normal and stressed conditions we have implemented and will continue to implement actions to prepare for compliance with this evolving standard see regulation contained herein in item 1 for additional information regarding the orsa 97
