the discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements included below the table of contents risk factors included in item 1a selected financial data included in item 6 and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8executive summarythroughout 2012 we remained focused on disciplined topline growth in select markets and a sustainable capital generation and deployment strategy we continue to believe that our strategy of delivering a broad set of financial protection choices to employees while also enabling employers to define their financial contribution in support of those choices should enable us to continue in a leadership position in our markets over the long terma discussion of our operating performance and capital management follows2012 operating performance and capital management for 2012 we reported net income of 8944 million or 317 per diluted common share compared to 2011 net income of 2842 million or 094 per diluted common share aftertax operating income which excludes several nonoperating items as itemized in our reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained herein in item 7 was 8875 million or 315 per diluted common share in 2012 compared to 9054 million or 298 per diluted common share in 2011 total operating revenue by segment increased in 2012 relative to 2011 driven by growth in our premium income total operating income by segment was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 with growth in our unum us and colonial life segments offset by lower income in our other segments although our total operating income by segment declined in 2012 we reported yearoveryear earnings per share growth due to our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock see additional information in 2011 longterm care review and individual disability closed block reserves consolidated operating results and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained herein in item 7our unum us segment reported an increase in segment operating income of 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 with growth in premium income consistent risk results and continued favorable expense management although unum us premium income increased 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment continue to pressure our premium income growth in particular premium growth from existing customers continues to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under existing policies the benefit ratio for our unum us segment for 2012 was generally consistent with the level reported in 2011 with favorable supplemental and voluntary risk results offset by less favorable risk results for group disability and group life unum us sales increased 75 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 with growth in each of our product lines and in each of our major market segments premium persistency was above or generally consistent with the levels of 2011 for most of our product lines and remains high relative to historical levelsour unum uk segment reported a decrease in segment operating income of 303 percent in 2012 relative to 2011 as measured in unum uks local currency due primarily to adverse risk results in our group life product line premium income grew 22 percent in 2012 relative to 2011 as a result of premium rate increases and growth in existing customer accounts partially offset by lower premium persistency premium growth continues to be pressured due to the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment in the uk as well as our initiation of premium rate increases the benefit ratio for unum uk was 779 percent in 2012 compared to 718 percent in 2011 driven by adverse risk results in group life and slightly less favorable group disability risk results unum uk sales decreased 51 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 as measured in unum uks local currency with lower group life group critical illness and individual disability product line sales partially offset by higher sales in group longterm disability premium persistency declined as expected primarily as a result of our premium rate increasesour colonial life segment reported an increase in segment operating income of 16 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 with higher operating revenue partially offset by less favorable risk results and higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs premium income grew 52 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 the benefit ratio for colonial life was 525 percent in 2012 compared to 519 percent in 2011 due to less favorable risk results in the life and cancer and critical illness lines of business partially offset by a more favorable benefit ratio for the accident sickness and disability line of business colonial life sales decreased 11 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 with a slight increase in core commercial market segment sales which we define as accounts with fewer than 1000 lives offset by declines in large case commercial market segment sales and sales in the public sector market persistency continues to be strong and was higher for all product lines in 2012 compared to 2011 30our closed block segment reported a decrease in segment operating income of 229 percent in 2012 relative to 2011 excluding the charges discussed in 2011 longterm care review and individual disability closed block reserves contained herein in item 7 also excluding these charges individual disability risk results were favorable compared to 2011 due to higher claim recovery rates and a decrease in reserves for existing claims while longterm care risk results were unfavorable compared to the prior year due to higher claim incidence rates partially offset by higher claim resolutionsour investment portfolio continues to perform well although our net investment income declined slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decline in yield in invested assets as we continue to invest new cash flows at lower rates our asset quality remains strong with a net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities of 72 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 58 billion at december 31 2011 we believe our capital and financial positions are strong at december 31 2012 the riskbased capital rbc ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula was approximately 396 percent compared to 405 percent at december 31 2011 the decline relative to 2011 results primarily from higher levels of capital required to support our business growth but our rbc ratio at year end 2012 is within our target range of 375 percent to 400 percent our leverage ratio when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital was 304 percent at december 31 2012 compared to 287 percent at december 31 2011 the increase was due to the august 2012 issuance of 2500 million of senior notes and the increase in shortterm debt related to securities lending agreements outstanding partially offset by our 2012 principal payments on the debt of northwind holdings llc northwind holdings and tailwind holdings llc tailwind holdings our leverage ratio when calculated excluding the nonrecourse debt and associated capital of northwind holdings and tailwind holdings and the shortterm debt arising from securities lending agreements was 253 percent at december 31 2012 compared to 235 percent at december 31 2011 cash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately 805 million and 756 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively further discussion is included in consolidated operating results reconciliation of nongaap financial measures segment results investments and liquidity and capital resources contained in this item 7outlook for 2013we anticipate the general environment for 2013 to be similar to 2012 with belowaverage economic growth and a continuation of low interest rates while the environment will remain challenging the need for our products and services remains strong we believe we are taking the needed actions to protect our solid margins and returns and the impact of our pricing and risk actions will likely not have a favorable impact on our financial results until 2014 and beyond while we anticipate that our 2013 operating growth will be below our longterm targets we currently believe that our per diluted common share aftertax operating income growth will be neutral to positive relative to the level of 2012during 2013 we intend to remain focused on disciplined topline growth in select markets continued effectiveness in our operating performance and a consistent sustainable capital generation and deployment strategy we continue to believe that our strategy of delivering a broad set of financial protection choices to employees while also enabling employers to define their financial contribution in support of those choices should enable us to continue in a leadership position in our markets over the long term2011 longterm care review and individual disability closed block reserveslongterm care strategic reviewfollowing a comprehensive and strategic review of our longterm care business in february 2012 we announced that we would discontinue selling group longterm care we discontinued selling individual longterm care during 2009 because both group and individual longterm care are considered closed blocks of business effective december 31 2011 we reclassified our longterm care products from the unum us segment to the closed block segment we also reclassified our other insurance products not actively marketed including individual life and corporateowned life insurance reinsurance pools and management operations group pension health insurance and individual annuities which were previously reported in the corporate and other segment to the closed block segment the inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with our reporting and monitoring of our closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with our separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these changes in our reporting classifications31as part of the strategic review and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year we analyzed our reserve assumptions for longterm care in conjunction with our annual loss recognition testing we generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year but more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test included in the analysis was a review of our reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in longterm interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of 2011 due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve boards actions including the announcement of operation twist we also considered an updated industry study for longterm care experience which was made available midyear 2011 from the society of actuaries our analysis of this study which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience based on our analysis as of december 31 2011 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates we also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience while our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2011 we determined that deferred acquisition costs of 1960 million as adjusted for the january 1 2012 retrospective adoption of the accounting standards update related to deferred acquisition costs were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by 5736 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations these charges decreased our 2011 net income by 5003 million the increase in reserves represented a 105 percent increase in longterm care policy and claim reserves as of december 31 2011 which equaled 54 billion subsequent to the charge claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block businessclaim reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business we are now able with a higher degree of confidence to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible there is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered these benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age longer duration disabled claimants which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits as a result of this experience as of december 31 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and as a result increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by 1835 million and decreased net income by 1193 million the increase in reserves represented a 15 percent increase in individual disability policy and claim reserves as of december 31 2011 which equaled 119 billion subsequent to the charge critical accounting estimateswe prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements the accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits deferred acquisition costs valuation of investments pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes and contingent liabilities for additional information refer to our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 32reserves for policy and contract benefitsour largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us these reserves equaled 399 billion and 393 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively or approximately 744 percent and 765 percent of our total liabilities respectively reserves ceded to reinsurers were 67 billion at both december 31 2012 and 2011 and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets policy reservespolicy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums allowing a margin for expenses and profit these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interestsensitive products including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment individual disability products in our unum uk segment disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment and individual disability and longterm care products in our closed block segment the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie loss recognition occurs persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns in establishing policy reserves we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation we do not however establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptionswe perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency thereafter the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing referred to as the gross premium valuation method wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency mortality and morbidity and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance therefore we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains inforce even after a separate claim reserve is established incidence rates in industry standard valuation tables for policy reserves have traditionally included all lives active and disabled in addition the waiver of premium provision provides funding for the policy reserve while a policyholder is disabled as a result the funding mechanisms and the cost of claims are aligned and require a policy reserve to be held while on claim in addition most policies allow for multiple occurrences of claims and a policy reserve is consequently still maintained at the time of claim to fund any potential future claims the policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders reach the terminal age for coverage die or voluntarily lapse the policy policy reserves for unum us unum uk and colonial life products which at december 31 2012 represented approximately 121 percent 02 percent and 97 percent respectively of our total gross policy reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap in applying this method we use as applicable by product type morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions claim resolution rate assumptions and policy persistency assumptions among others to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income we then apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive with a provision for profit allowed policy reserves for our closed block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability individual and group longterm care and certain other products all of which are no longer actively marketed the reserves for individual disability and individual and group longterm care which represented approximately 408 percent of our total gross policy reserves at 33december 31 2012 are determined using the gross premium valuation method reserves for individual disability are based on assumptions established as of january 1 2004 the date of loss recognition reserves for longterm care are based on assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of loss recognition key assumptions are persistency mortality claim incidence claim resolution rates commission rates and maintenance expense rates we apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive with no provision for future profit the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business under the gross premium valuation method we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business annually or more frequently if appropriate policy reserves for certain other products excluding individual disability and individual and group longterm care which are no longer actively marketed and reported in our closed block segment represent 57 billion on a gross basis or approximately 372 percent of our total policy reserves we have ceded 45 billion of these other products policy reserves to reinsurers the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable we continue to service a block of group pension products which we have not ceded and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilitiesclaim reservesclaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and as prescribed by gaap equals our longterm best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim such as the benefits available under the applicable policy the covered benefit period and the age and occupation of the claimant as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate reserves for ibnr claims similar to incurred claim reserves include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions including claim reporting patterns the average cost of claims and the expected volumes of incurred claims our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptionsclaim reserves unlike policy reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate if we believe based on our actual experience and our view of future events that our longterm assumptions need to be modified we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period incomemultiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method the paid development method the incurred loss development method the count and severity method and the expected claim cost method no single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reservesclaim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability product lines and our closed block individual disability and individual and group longterm care product lines represent approximately 359 percent and 470 percent respectively of our total claim reserves at december 31 2012 we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual longterm disability and group and individual longterm care claims that have been reported under the tabular reserve methodology reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants such as age length of time disabled and medical diagnosis we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate longterm liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim ibnr claim reserves for our longterm products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs for unum us group shortterm disability products an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted as well as ibnr claims is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our longterm products using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our longterm liabilities and results in less estimation variability 34claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately 39 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2012 claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid ibnr death claims and a liability for waiver of premium benefits the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately 97 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2012 and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience adjusted for unum uks own experience the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have shortterm benefits which generally have less estimation variability than our longterm products because of the shorter claim payout period our claim reserves for colonial lifes lines of business which approximate 14 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2012 are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are 1 the timing rate and amount of estimated future claim payments and 2 the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims the following table displays policy reserves incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves by major product line with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our longterm care products ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products the ibnr and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis in millions of dollarsdecember 31 2012 gross total   policy   claim reserves     reinsurance total reserves  incurred ibnr  total ceded netgroup disability  70008 5960 309 75968 613 75355group

     445459 69458 376001key assumptionsthe calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are 1 the discount rate 2 the claim resolution rate and 3 the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves of these assumptions our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 1the discount rate which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in this case the reserves may eventually be insufficient we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield2the claim resolution rate used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the probability that a disability or longterm care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time claim resolution assumptions involve many factors including the cause of disability the policyholders age the type of contractual benefits provided and the time since initially becoming disabled we primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience 363the incidence rate used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured the insureds occupation or industry the benefit plan design and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors reserves particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for longterm disabilities and longterm care are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion the impact of internal and external events such as changes in claims management procedures economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence the emergence of new diseases new trends and developments in medical treatments and legal trends and legislative changes among other factors will influence claim incidence and resolution rates in addition for policies offering coverage for disability or longterm care at advanced ages the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line additionally in any period and over time our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our longterm assumptions either singularly or collectively and these variances may offset each other we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a longterm view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption but rather in the aggregate by product line we have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions in aggregate for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for either favorable or unfavorable trends in key assumptionsgenerally we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time however we have historically experienced an increase in our group longterm disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period particularly in our unum us operations during 2012 and 2011 claim incidence rates for unum us group longterm disability continued to be slightly elevated relative to the level of 2010 given the current economic conditions it is possible that our claim incidence rates for this type of product may increase during the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed an extensive review of experience factors for our longterm care business using emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience an updated industry study for longterm care experience was made available midyear 2011 from the society of actuaries which allowed us to compare our limited company experience to broader industry experience and trends the trends reflected in emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience resulted in a modification to our mortality and morbidity assumptions which together with the decline in interest rates as noted below resulted in our recognition of a loss deficiency in our longterm care closed block of business as of december 31 2011 during 2012 we observed elevated claims experience for our longterm care line of business which we view as temporary in nature see longterm care strategic review contained in this item 7 throughout the period 2010 to 2012 actual new money interest rates varied with the changing market conditions and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves during this period generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines in 2011 longterm interest rates declined significantly due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve boards actions including the announcement of operation twist interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical norms throughout 2012 reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the longduration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of businessboth the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have remained stable and consistent with expectations claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately claim resolution rates in our unum us segment group and individual longterm disability product lines and our closed block individual disability product line have over the last several years exhibited some variability relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business actual quarterly rates during 2011 and 2012 have varied by 5 and 4 percent in our unum us group longterm disability line of business between 14 and 13 percent in our unum us individual disability 37 recently issued line of business and between 4 and 4 percent in our closed block individual disability line of business claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time throughout the period 2010 to 2012 we had generally stable to improving claims management performance and our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our longterm assumptions our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period both favorably and unfavorably as our claims data for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block in our closed block individual disability line of business has become credible we are now able with a higher degree of confidence to assess our own experience for this particular claim block emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age longer duration disabled claimants which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits as a result of this experience as of december 31 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption resulting in an increase of 1835 million in our closed block individual disability line of business claim reserves experience in 2012 remained generally consistent with our updated mortality assumption see claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business contained in this item 7 we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate in our estimation scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions when modeled together in aggregate could produce a potential result either positive or negative in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our claim reserve balance by  31 percent using our actual claim reserve balance at december 31 2012 this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of 230 million to our claim reserves using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our closed block individual disability line of business the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by  23 percent of our reported balance which at december 31 2012 would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of 230 million to our claim reserves the major contributor to the variance for both the unum us group longterm disability line of business and the closed block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate in addition we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to longterm care policy reserves these reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of loss recognition assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient as such positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge variability in our reserve assumptions for longterm care may be mitigated by potential future rate increases particularly those variations associated with longterm changes in morbidity or mortality experience as well as investment yields when modeled in the aggregate downside scenarios based on reasonably possible adverse variations in each of our reserve assumptions including the potential impact of future rate increases on expected future premiums we will receive could require a reserve increase of 73 percent of our reported balance which at december 31 2012 would have resulted in an approximate increase of 400 million to our policy reserves we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions in the aggregate could result in a material impact on our reserve levels but we record our reserves based on our longterm best estimate because these product lines have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs either positive or negative  deferred acquisition costs dac we defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies deferred costs include certain commissions other agency compensation selection and policy issue expenses and field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral approximately 84 percent of our dac relates to traditional non interestsensitive products and we amortize dac for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies dac related to interestsensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are persistency premium income and for our interestsensitive products mortality margins and investment returns we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions for traditional products the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy during 2012 our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2012 did not change materially from those used in 2011 generally we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 38the following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years 3 10 and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred and our dac

adjusted to reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to the anticipated experience any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur as an example for our traditional products we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years we measure the recoverability of dac by performing loss recognition tests in the fourth quarter of each year but more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform loss recognition tests if loss recognition testing indicates that dac is not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense our loss

strategic review contained in this item 7 for further discussionin october 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update now included in accounting standards codification 944 financial services  insurance to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs the amendments in the update modified the existing guidance and require that only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract can be capitalized all other costs are to be expensed as incurred see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our retrospective adoption of this update valuation of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as availableforsale and are reported at fair value our derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities which are also reported at fair value 39definition of fair valuefair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available conversely financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditionsvaluation techniquesvaluation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types1the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables or matrix pricing market multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable the selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment considering both quantitative and qualitative factors specific to the measurement matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities2the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount income approach techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques optionpricing models that incorporate present value techniques and the multiperiod excess earnings method3the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or the current replacement cost that is from the perspective of a market participant seller the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utilitywe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort in some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities in other cases multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value we evaluate and weigh the results as appropriate considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstancesthe selection of the valuation methods to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the type of investments we hold the market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades price quotes from third party pricing vendors price quotes we obtain from outside brokers matrix pricing discounted cash flow and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs when using a pricing service we obtain the vendors pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies we periodically review and approve the selection of our pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies when markets are less active brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker our internal investment management professionals which include portfolio managers and analysts monitor 40securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions we also consider the nature of the quote particularly whether the quote is a binding offer if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value when relevant market data is unavailable which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty the income approach can in suitable circumstances provide a more appropriate fair value during 2012 we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2011 inputs to valuation techniquesinputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique we use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instrumentsobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sourcesunobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances inputs that may be used include the following broker

spreadsrelevant reports issued by analysts and rating agencies audited financial statementsthe management of our investment portfolio includes establishing pricing policy and reviewing the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a securitys price in the event we receive a vendors market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security we may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade we also review all price changes from the prior month which fall outside a predetermined corridor the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price these adjustments may be made when in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument the market in which the financial instrument is traded counterparty credit risk credit structure concentration or liquidity additionally an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument in the event an asset is sold we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting period closest to the transaction date 41the parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies rather the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the london interbank offered rate libor setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values if net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the liborbased fair value obtained from our pricing sources we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources for purposes of valuing net counterparty risk we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and under current market conditions in regard to our own credit risk component we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the liborbased valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit riskfair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities interest rate risk and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangementcertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active marketas of december 31 2012 the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below where appropriate we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change risk free interest rates of 072 percent for fiveyear maturities to 295 percent for 30year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities this compares to interest rates of 083 percent for fiveyear maturities to 289 percent for 30year maturities used at december 31 2011 current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from 098 percent to 223 percent were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity we used spreads ranging from 153 percent to 297 percent at december 31 2011 the changes were based on observable market spreads newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums higher than a similar interest rate spread on comparable newly issued public securitiesadditional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for foreign investments certain industries and individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater riskat december 31 2012 approximately 49 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from trace pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security comparable to receiving one binding quote the prices obtained were not adjusted and the assets were classified as level 1 the highest category of the threelevel fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the remaining 951 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on nonbinding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs as discussed below approximately 775 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques these assets were classified as level 2 level 2 assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs other than prices included in level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life42approximately 38 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more nonbinding broker price levels if validated by observable market data or on trace prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity when only one price is available it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate these assets for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data were classified as level 2approximately 138 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities matrix pricing market models andor internal models or were valued based on nonbinding quotes with no other observable market data these assets were classified as either level 2 or level 3 with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data level 3 is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date financial assets and liabilities categorized as level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value we consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value we use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary we classify these assets or liabilities as level 3as of december 31 2012 approximately 49 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level 1 907 percent as level 2 and 44 percent as level 3 during 2012 we transferred 11861 million of fixed maturity securities into level 3 and 5566 million of fixed maturity securities out of level 3 the transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities transferred 1 transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades 2 brokerdealer quotes and pricing primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly and 3 comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis for fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of level 3 we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period we believe this allows for greater transparency as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our level 3 reconciliation as shown in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 otherthantemporary impairment analysis for investmentsin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate the following factors whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securitywhether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basiswhether the security is current as to principal and interest paymentsthe significance of the decline in valuethe time period during which there has been a significant decline in valuecurrent and future business prospects and

actionsbid and offering prices and the level of trading activityadverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investmentschanges in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet dateany other key measures for the related security we evaluate available information including the factors noted above both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we also consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and near term funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security43while determining otherthantemporary impairments is a judgmental area we utilize a formal welldefined and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an otherthantemporary impairmentif we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income as applicable for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we have not recognized an otherthantemporary impairment we believe we will recover the entire amortized cost we do not intend to sell the security and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost there have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any securities for which we have not recorded an otherthantemporary impairmentotherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition the determination of cash flows is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security the timing and amount of our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer including its current and projected liquidity position we also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts sector credit ratings future business prospects and earnings trends issuer refinancing capabilities actual andor potential asset sales by the issuer and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security we take into account the probability of default expected recoveries third party guarantees quality of collateral and where our debt security ranks in terms of subordination we may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the present value of cash flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income we use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation mortgage loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans considering the value of the underlying collateral the value of which is periodically assessed mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of incomethere are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilitiesthe assessment of a borrowers ability to meet its contractual obligations will change the economic outlook either domestic or foreign may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated and as such the investment may not recover in value new information may become available concerning the security such as disclosure of accounting irregularities fraud or corporate governance issues significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industrysignificant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchasedadverse rating agency actions may occursee notes 1 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further details on our investments and derivatives44pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees including nonqualified pension plans the us pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense our uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on december 31 2002our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets we also use as applicable expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits which reflects a health care cost trend rate and the uk pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefitsthe assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans are reviewed annually using a december 31 measurement date for each of our plans the discount rate assumptions and expected longterm rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions special benefits to terminated employees or changes in benefits provided under the plans discount rate assumptionsthe discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirementrelated benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs the discount rate we used to determine our 2013 and 2012 net periodic benefit costs for our us pension plans was 450 percent and 540 percent respectively the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for 2013 and 2012 for our uk pension plan was 450 percent and 490 percent respectively the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our opeb plan for 2013 and 2012 was 420 percent and 520 percent respectively  regarding sensitivity analysis a decrease in the discount rate assumption of 50 basis points would increase our 2012 pension and opeb expenses by approximately 199 million before tax and would increase our pension and opeb benefit obligations by approximately 2140 million as of december 31 2012 resulting in an aftertax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately 1415 million as of december 31 2012 an increase in the discount rate assumption of 50 basis points would decrease our 2012 pension and opeb expenses by approximately 166 million before tax and would decrease our pension and opeb benefit obligations by approximately 1962 million as of december 31 2012 resulting in an aftertax increase in stockholders equity of approximately 1300 million as of december 31 2012 longterm rate of return assumptionsthe longterm rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid the us pension plans use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on their pension plan assets the investment portfolio for our us qualified pension plan contains a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap mid cap and small cap equity securities us government and agency and corporate fixed income securities private equity funds of funds and hedge funds of funds assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds including diversified growth funds which invest in assets such as global equities hedge funds commodities belowinvestmentgrade fixed income securities and currencies as well as leveraged interest rate and inflation swap funds intended to broadly match part of the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the plans liabilities assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily in life insurance contracts we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector with no potential risk concentrations in any one category our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists and current market yields for the us pension plans the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as longterm rates of return volatility of returns and the correlation of returns between various 45asset classes the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plans current asset allocation investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition  the longterm rate of return on asset assumption used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2013 and 2012 was 750 percent for both years the longterm rate of return on asset assumption used for 2013 and 2012 for our uk pension plan was 620 percent and 580 percent respectively and for our opeb plan was 575 percent for both years the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period adjusted for contributions and benefit payments a change in the expected longterm rate of return on the pension plan assets of 50 basis points would change our 2012 pension plan expense by approximately 70 million before tax but would not materially change our opeb plan expense a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense benefit obligation and fair value of plan assetsthe marketrelated value equals the fair value of assets determined as of the measurement date the return on assets fully recognizes all asset gains and losses including changes in fair value through the measurement date during 2012 the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan increased 1828 million or approximately 156 percent while the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan increased 55 million or approximately 46 percent although the effect of these increases in fair value had no impact on our 2012 net periodic pension costs the favorable rate of return on these plan assets in 2012 will have a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for 2013 but we expect this favorable impact to be negated by the decrease in the liability discount rate for these plans we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of 9026 million and a net unrecognized prior service credit of 65 million which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense as of december 31 2012 the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was approximately 8961 million the unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost our 2012 2011 and 2010 pension and opeb expense includes 434 million 288 million and 291 million respectively of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain loss and prior service credit cost  the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans which is 8833 million at december 31 2012 will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants currently estimated at 11 years for both us and uk participants to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor as described below the unrecognized net actuarial loss of 193 million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants currently estimated at 5 years to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap the corridor for the pension and opeb plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation at december 31 2012 6487 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the us plan and 107 million was outside of the corridor for the uk plan at december 31 2012 none of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the opeb plan the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was 13536 million at december 31 2012 compared to 11708 million at december 31 2011 the effect of a reduction in the liability discount rate partially offset by the increase in fair value of plan assets increased our year end deficit funding level to 4543 million at december 31 2012 compared to 2747 million as of december 31 2011 the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was 115 million at december 31 2012 compared to 117 million at december 31 2011 these assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan our opeb plan represents a nonvested nonguaranteed obligation and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits which are comprised of retiree life medical and dental benefits it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan we expect to continue to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 based on current law to partially offset these payments the expected subsidy included in our consolidated balance sheets is immaterial we discontinued offering retiree life insurance to future retirees effective december 31 2012 we will still provide this benefit to those employees who retired prior to december 31 2012 46our expected return on plan assets and discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by erisa we had no regulatory contribution requirements for 2012 and 2011 however we elected to make a voluntary contribution of 53 million in 2012 to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan we made no contributions in 2011 we expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately 50 million to our us qualified defined benefit plan during 2013 during 2006 the us federal government enacted the pension protection act of 2006 which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period we have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future based on this assessment we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity   the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan was 1265 million at december 31 2012 compared to 1209 million at december 31 2011 the uk pension plan had a surplus of 53 million and 113 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least 248 percent of pensionable salaries for active members of the plan plus 04 percent of pensionable salaries for all employees including active members of the plan who are entitled to lump sum deathinservice benefits under the plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation during 2012 and 2011 we made required contributions of 26 million and 29 million respectively we expect to make contributions of approximately 26 million during 2013  see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionincome taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in 2011 as part of an internal revenue service irs settlement we released a 41 million valuation allowance related to basis differences in foreign subsidiaries and net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions for which we previously believed we would not realize a tax benefit as of december 31 2012 we had no valuation allowance in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions both domestic and foreign the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met  if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective we believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity with gaapsee note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 847contingent liabilitieson a quarterly basis we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending

not a meaningful percentagein describing our results we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures as follows for additional discussion of these items also as previously discussed effective january 1 2012 we adopted an accounting standards update regarding the capitalization of costs associated with the acquisition of insurance contracts and applied the amendments retrospectively prior period results have been adjusted to reflect our retrospective adoption see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionthe comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the british pound sterling to dollar exchange rate the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling in periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period as occurred in 2012 compared to 2011 translating into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior periods in periods when the pound strengthens relative to the preceding period as occurred in 2011 compared to 2010 translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period our weighted average pounddollar exchange rate was 1584 1603 and 1543 for the years ended 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively if the 2011 and 2010 results for our uk operations had been translated at the exchange rate of 2012 our operating revenue by segment in 2011 and 2010 would have been approximately 110 million lower and 203 million higher 48respectively and our operating income by segment in 2011 and 2010 would have been approximately 23 million lower and 59 million higher respectively however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk consolidated premium income for both 2012 and 2011 includes premium growth relative to the preceding years for each of our three major business segments although we continue to experience pressure on premium growth in many of our product lines due to the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment premium income continues to decline as expected in our closed block individual disability line of business but our closed block longterm care line of business experienced premium growth during 2012 and 2011 relative to the preceding years due to limited issuances of group longterm care policies continued high persistency levels and the implementation of rate increases for certain of our individual longterm care policies net investment income was slightly lower in 2012 relative to 2011 due primarily to a decline in yield on invested assets an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships and lower income on our unum uk inflation indexlinked bonds these declines were partially offset by a higher level of invested assets higher bond call premiums an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities net investment income increased slightly in 2011 relative to 2010 due primarily to continued growth in invested assets and higher bond call premiums partially offset by an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in tax credit partnerships a decrease in income on other partnership investments and lower prepayment income on mortgagebacked securitieswe recognized in earnings a net realized investment gain of 562 million in 2012 compared to a loss of 49 million in 2011 and a gain of 247 million in 2010 included in these amounts were otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities of 199 million and 159 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively all of which were recognized in earnings we had no otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities during 2012 also recognized in earnings through realized investment gains and losses was the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement changes in the fair value of this embedded derivative resulted in a realized gain of 518 million 2012 compared to a loss of 394 million in 2011 and a gain of 211 million in 2010 gains and losses on this embedded derivative result primarily from changes in credit spreads in the overall investment marketthe benefit ratios were 871 percent in 2012 compared to 959 percent in 2011 and 855 percent in 2010 excluding the 2011 reserve charges in our closed block segment the benefit ratio for 2011 was 859 percent the yearoveryear increase in 2012 was primarily attributable to adverse risk results in our unum uk group life line of business and in our closed block longterm care line of business risk results in our unum us segment for 2012 were generally consistent with the level reported in 2011 and the benefit ratio for colonial life was only slightly elevated in 2012 compared to 2011 risk results for 2011 were slightly unfavorable relative to 2010 excluding the reserve charges with favorable risk results in our unum us segment and the closed block individual disability line of business offset by unfavorable risk results in our unum uk and colonial life segments and our closed block longterm care line of business further discussion of our line of business risk results for each of our segments is included in segment results as follows interest and debt expense for 2012 was slightly higher than 2011 due primarily to the issuance of 2500 million of debt in august 2012 partially offset by the maturity of 2251 million of debt in march 2011 interest and debt expense was marginally higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the september 2010 issuance of 4000 million of debt mostly offset by the maturity of 2251 million of debt in march 2011 we also experienced lower interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 on 3500 million of debt which we effectively converted into floating rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap entered into during the fourth quarter of 2010 see debt contained in this item 7 and note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further information on our debt the deferral of acquisition costs increased in both 2012 and 2011 relative to the prior years with continued growth in certain of our product lines and the associated increase in deferrable expenses more than offsetting the lower level of deferrable costs in product lines with lower growth 49the amortization of deferred acquisition costs continues to increase yearoveryear due to continued growth in the level of the deferred asset for certain of our product lines also impacting comparability between the years shown are adjustments for actual premium persistency which deviates from assumptions for certain issue years in certain of our traditional product lines as well as the impact from prospective unlocking for actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to anticipated experience for certain of our interestsensitive product lines at december 31 2011 we determined that our longterm care deferred acquisition costs were not recoverable and we recognized an impairment charge at that time further discussion of deferred acquisition costs and amortization by product line for each of our segments is included in segment results as follows the yearoveryear variability in compensation expense primarily relates to incentive compensation which varies with the volume of sales also contributing to the variability were higher expenses in 2012 relative to the two preceding years for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and higher expenses in 2011 as compared to either 2012 or 2010 due to costs related to the implementation of expense management initiatives other expenses were lower in both 2012 and 2011 compared to the prior years due to our continued focus on operating effectiveness and expense management see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans our income tax for 2012 2011 and 2010 includes reductions of 93 million 68 million and 27 million respectively to reflect the impact of the decrease in the uk corporation tax rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to our uk operations other items impacting our reported income tax rate include a release of an 110 million tax liability during 2012 related to unrecognized tax benefits a reduction in federal income taxes of 413 million during 2011 due to a final settlement with the irs an 186 million tax during 2011 related to the repatriation of 1500 million of dividends from our uk subsidiaries and a tax of 102 million during 2010 to reflect the impact of the tax law change related to postretirement prescription drug coverage also lowering our income tax rate in 2012 and 2011 relative to the preceding year is an increase in the level of our investments in lowincome housing tax credit partnerships in january 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 retroactively reinstated the active financing income exemption which affects the amount of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that is taxed annually regardless of whether foreign earnings are repatriated our 2012 income tax reflects the taxation of all active financing income from our foreign subsidiaries the amount of which was immaterial in the first quarter of 2013 our income tax will reflect reinstatement of the exemption for active financing income and we will reverse the amounts recorded in our 2012 income tax see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further information on our income taxes reconciliation of nongaap financial measureswe analyze our performance using nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe operating income or loss which excludes the specified items listed in our reconciliation is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities certain components of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans namely the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses are primarily driven by market performance and are not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income by segment provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and will increase or decrease over time depending on market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans we also exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability the nongaap financial measures of operating revenue operating income or operating loss and aftertax operating income differ from revenue income before income tax and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of beforetax realized investment gains or losses

beforetax charges of 1960 million to recognize an impairment of our longterm care deferred acquisition costs and 5736 million and 1835 million to increase reserves in our longterm care and individual

slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 with sales growth of 119 percent and generally stable persistency levels as previously discussed high unemployment levels and the competitive environment continue to pressure our premium income growth including growth from existing customers net investment income declined in 2012 relative to 2011 due to a decrease in income from bond call premiums a decrease in the level of invested assets and a decline in yield on invested assets partially offset by an increase in the level of prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities other income for 2012 included fees from administrative services products of 817 million compared to 779 million in 2011 the benefit ratio was slightly unfavorable in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate during the third quarter of 2012 for group longterm disability new claim incurrals compared to a 25 basis point decrease during the third quarter of 2011 also unfavorably impacting the benefit ratio for group disability were higher claim prevalence rates and a higher average weekly indemnity for shortterm disability mostly offset by favorable longterm disability claim recoveries 54the deferral of acquisition costs in 2012 was higher than 2011 due primarily to higher sales the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due

from administrative services products of 779 million and 749 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the benefit ratio was slightly higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due to an increase in group longterm and shortterm disability incidence rates and a decrease in the claim reserve discount rate for group longterm disability new claim incurrals as previously discussed these unfavorable impacts on the benefit ratio were mostly offset by a higher rate of group longterm disability claim recoveriesthe deferral of acquisition costs in 2011 was higher than 2010 due to a higher level of sales in 2011 and an increase in the associated acquisition costs the amortization of acquisition costs in 2011 was lower than 2010 due to a decrease in amortization related to internal replacement transactions although we continued our focus on operating effectiveness and expense management throughout 2011 the other expense ratio was slightly higher in 2011 relative to 2010 due primarily to an increase in

sales in our group large case market segment were 164 percent higher in 2012 compared to 2011 with increases in each of the product lines within this market segment other than group life we continued our disciplined and opportunistic approach to sales growth in the large case market during 2012 and although the level of sales in this market segment was higher than in 2011 our new business pricing was within our guidelines our sales mix in 2012 was approximately 69 percent core market and 31 percent large case market generally consistent with 2011 sales of voluntary benefits were 88 percent higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to strong large case sales and increases in sales to both new and existing customers the number of new accounts added in the voluntary benefits product line was 69 percent lower in 2012 than the number of new accounts added during 2011 sales in our individual disability  recently issued line of business which are primarily concentrated in the multilife market were 25 percent higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to higher sales to existing customerswe believe that the group core market and voluntary benefits market which combined together are approximately 73 percent of our unum us sales for 2012 and grew approximately 58 percent relative to 2011 represent significant growth opportunities we will also continue to seek disciplined and opportunistic growth in the group large case and individual disability markets while in the short term we expect economic trends to continue to pressure our sales growth we believe we are well positioned to expand existing relationships and leverage our brand and market leadershipyear ended december 31 2011 compared with year ended december 31 2010 unum us sales were higher in 2011

percent higher than the number of new accounts added during 2010 sales in our group large case market segment were 94 percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher group longterm disability and group life sales partially offset by lower group shortterm disability and accidental death and dismemberment sales our sales mix of group products in 2011 was approximately 71 percent core market and 29 percent large case market sales of voluntary benefits were 63 percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to higher sales from existing customers the number of new accounts added in the voluntary benefits product line was 29 percent higher in 2011 than the number of new accounts added during 2010 sales in our individual disability  recently issued line of business which are primarily concentrated in the multilife market were 302 percent higher in 2011 compared to 2010 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to strong sales in our larger sized markets as well as the unusually low volume of sales we experienced during 2010 for this line of business 60segment outlookwe believe that premium and sales growth particularly growth in existing customer accounts will continue to be pressured by the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment although we expect to continue to achieve marginal yearoveryear growth in our premium income during 2013 and beyond opportunities for further premium and sales growth are not expected to reemerge until the economy improves and employment growth accelerates our net investment income may be impacted either favorably or unfavorably by fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income the current interest rate environment is putting nearterm pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income and claim reserve discount rates as a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the aging of insureds we began initiating price increases for our group disability products during the first quarter of 2012 and will continue with the price increases during 2013 we anticipate that the benefit ratio for our group disability product line for 2013 will generally be consistent with the level of 2012 depending on claim incidence rates and claim discount rates we think future profit margin improvement is achievable driven primarily by our continued product mix shift and expense efficiencies as our claims performance gradually flattens certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the disability insurance business components of claims experience such as incidence and recovery rates may be worse than we expect disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates or lower discount rates but these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates we have previously taken steps to improve our risk profile including reducing our exposure to volatile business segments through diversification by market size product segment and industry segment we believe our claims management organization is positioned for stable and sustainable performance levels claim incidence levels may fluctuate due to the normal volatility that occurs in group disability business or may be related to economic conditions we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we believe our unum us growth strategy is sound and that we will be able to leverage the capabilities products and relationships and reputation we have built to deliver growth as the benefits market stabilizes we continue to see future growth opportunity based on employee choice defined employer funding superior service and effective communication we intend to maintain our discipline and will continue i directing the majority of our efforts on capturing opportunities emerging in our core group and voluntary markets to grow them at abovemarket rates ii focusing on margins in large case group insurance while leveraging core market voluntary and other shorterterm investments to grow at market rates and iii seeking opportunities to improve margins and return in our supplemental lines of business we believe we are well positioned strategically in our markets and that opportunities for continued disciplined growth exist in our group core market segment and in the voluntary markets61unum uk segment the unum uk segment includes insurance for group longterm

benefit ratio was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 with unfavorable risk results in both group longterm disability and group life group longterm disability risk results were unfavorable in 2012

in unum uks group longterm disability product line were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher sales in both the core market which we define for unum uk as employee groups with fewer than 500 lives and in the large case market partially offset by lower sales to existing customers group life sales were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to our discontinuance of new sales of certain of our group life product lines during the third quarter of 2012 lower large case sales and lower sales to existing customers partially offset by higher core market sales supplemental and voluntary sales were lower in 2012 compared to the 2011 due primarily to lower sales in our group critical illness and individual disability product lines sales in unum uks group longterm disability and group life product lines were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a decline in sales in both the core and large case markets these declines were partially offset by higher sales to existing customers sales in the supplemental and voluntary line of business decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to lower individual disability product sales segment outlookour primary focus during 2013 is to stabilize profitability and improve growth over the medium term our shift in business mix and focus on premium rate increases for both group longterm disability and group life is expected to improve profitability however pressure on new sales and persistency is likely and the low interest rate environment is expected to dampen overall earnings growth we expect that the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment in the uk which has continued to negatively impact unum uks premium growth may continue in the near term the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 65in our group disability business we continue to have a cautious outlook for growth given the current environment we anticipate returning to more normal levels of premium growth as our rate increases continue to be placed in the market as persistency stabilizes and as we continue to increase sales to new and existing customers in addition we continue to focus on new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income protection expanding group disability market penetration remains a significant opportunity and priority in the ukin our group life business we continue to implement rate increases and we exited certain group life product lines in 2012 we expect group life premium income to decline in the near term as a result of these actions as well as a shift in business mix but we believe profit margins will improve we also entered into reinsurance agreements effective january 1 2013 to cede a portion of our group life business these reinsurance agreements will significantly decrease premium income and benefit payments during 2013 but are expected to reduce volatility in our group life line of business 66colonial life segment the colonial life segment

2011 as a result of growth in the level of invested assets an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and a higher level of fees from mortgage loan prepayments partially offset by a decline in income from bond call premiums and a decrease in yield the benefit ratio was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 for the life and cancer and critical illness lines of business partially offset by a lower benefit ratio for the accident sickness and disability line of business the increase in the life benefit ratio in 2012 was driven by higher mortality rates which can exhibit volatility from period to period the slight increase in the cancer and critical illness benefit ratio in 2012 was due primarily to a higher level of paid claims in the cancer line of business and a higher active life reserve change due to favorable persistency for certain issue years the slight decrease in the accident sickness and disability benefit ratio in 2012 was due to favorable claim experience in the disability product line 67commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were both higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in costs related to growth in new

while lower than expected sales presents a challenge in the near term we believe proper execution of our growth strategy and a gradual improvement in the economy will deliver sales and premium growth that are in line with longterm expectations we see the continuing us economic conditions and the increasing competition in the voluntary market as external risks to achievement of our business plans we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly premium growth has remained positive during 2012 and 2011 due in part to strong persistency and we expect the level of sales to improve in 2013 we expect volatility in net investment income to continue in 2013 as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on the risk results of colonial life due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration indemnity benefits we believe that strong profit margins will continue and we expect our overall benefit ratio in 2013 to be generally consistent with the 2012 level we believe we have a stable business model with service levels and customer retention that allow us to focus on and deliver premium growth despite the recent marketplace changes and uncertainties we believe we are well positioned for growth and that opportunities exist to accelerate growth during the next several years by i focusing on target market segments ii driving new sales in the public sector market iii growing the reach and effectiveness of our distribution and iv effectively serving our customers  69closed block segmentthe closed block segment consists of our closed individual

december 31 2011total premium income decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 with lower individual disability premium income partially offset by higher longterm care premium income the decrease in individual disability premium income was due to the runoff of this closed line of business driven by expected policy terminations and maturities the increase in longterm care premium income was due to issuances of group longterm care policies and the implementation of rate increases on certain of our individual longterm care policies although we announced in the first quarter of 2012 that we would no longer sell group longterm care we had group cases which were already in the quoting andor underwriting process at the time of our announcement and for which we have now issued the policies we continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group longterm care policies the rate increases reflect current interest rates and claim experience higher expected future claims persistency and other factors related to pricing longterm care coverage in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs net investment income was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher asset levels higher bond call premiums and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities and other fees partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets other income which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies  individual disability risk results for 2012 were favorable compared to 2011 due to the previously discussed 2011 reserve charge excluding this charge individual disability risk results were favorable compared to 2011 due to higher claim recovery rates and a decrease in reserves for existing claims longterm care risk results were favorable in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to the 2011 reserve charge excluding this charge risk results were unfavorable compared to 2011 due to higher claim incidence rates partially offset by higher claim resolutionsinterest and debt expense in 2012 was generally consistent with 2011 as principal repayments on the amount of outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings were offset by an increase in floatingrate interest on this debt  we had no amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 due to the longterm care impairment charge recognized at december 31 2011 the other expense ratio was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a decrease in selling and underwriting costs due to our discontinuance of the sale of group longterm care in 2012 and our continued focus on operating effectiveness and expense management year ended december 31 2011 compared with year ended december 31 2010total premium income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 with lower individual disability premium income partially offset by higher longterm care premium income the decrease in individual disability premium income is due to the continued runoff of this closed line of business the increase in longterm care premium income for 2011 relative to 2010 was driven by strong persistency and higher sales of group longterm care net investment income was higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due to primarily to higher asset levels partially offset by a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities and lower income from bond call premiums other income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies 71individual disability risk results in 2011 were unfavorable relative to 2010 due to the previously discussed 2011 reserve charge excluding the reserve charge risk results were slightly favorable compared to 2010 due to higher claim recovery rates partially offset by higher claim incidence rates longterm care risk results were unfavorable in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the 2011 reserve charge excluding the reserve charge risk results were unfavorable compared to 2010 due to increases in active life reserves which were driven by favorable premium persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years claim incidence rates for longterm care were also higher in 2011 compared to 2010interest and debt expense was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a decline in the amount of outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings as a result of principal repayments the deferral of acquisition costs was higher in 2011 relative to 2010 due to the increase in deferrable expenses associated with higher sales of group longterm care products the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was lower in 2011 than in 2010 due to lower levels of accelerated amortization related to favorable premium persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years as previously discussed at december 31 2011 we determined that our longterm care deferred acquisition costs were not recoverable and we recognized an impairment charge at that time the other expense ratio was favorable in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to lower claim litigation costs and lower expenses related to claim volumes   segment outlookwe expect that this segment may experience volatility in net investment income due to the variability in interest rates on floating rate assets and also due to volatility of bond call premiums relative to historical levels a portion of this volatility in interest income will be offset by commensurate changes in the interest expense on our individual disability floating rate debtwe expect that operating revenue and income for this segment will continue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down although we do expect additional premium income associated with longterm care rate increases we also expect a small amount of new group longterm care business to continue to be issued where we are required to do so under the terms of existing group policies profitability of our longtailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity investment returns and persistency we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for the individual disability and longterm care lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term but these product lines may experience quarterly volatility particularly in the nearterm for our longterm care product lines as our claim block matures claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period it is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions including but not limited to interest rates mortality morbidity and persistency could result in a material impact on our reserve levels including adjustments to reserves previously established under loss recognition 72corporate segmentthe corporate segment includes investment income on corporate

call premiums and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships the negative impact on net investment income and operating income by segment due to the higher level of investment in tax credit partnerships is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments other income was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to 175 million of interest income recognized in 2011 related to an irs settlement of our appeal to the irs related to tax years 1996 to 2004interest and debt expense was higher in 2012

were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a lower level of expense accruals during 2012 comparatively higher expenses in 2011 due in part to corporate initiatives and state income taxes recognized during 2011 as a result of the repatriation of uk dividends from our uk subsidiaries in 2011 partially offsetting these decreases in other expenses was an impairment of a longlived fixed

asset levels a lower proportion of assets invested at longterm interest rates a decrease in bond call premiums and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships other income was higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due to 175 million of interest income related to the irs settlement as previously discussedinterest and debt expense was higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the september 2010 issuance of 4000 million of 5625 senior notes partially offset by the maturity of our 2251 million senior notes in march 2011 and lower effective interest rates on certain senior notes which we effectively converted into floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps other expenses were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to the previously discussed 2011 increases in expense accruals and state income taxes73segment outlookwe expect the quality of our investment portfolio to remain strong the negative impact on net investment income due to the higher level of investment in tax credit partnerships may be such that net investment income for our corporate segment could be negatively impacted resulting in a higher operating segment loss for corporate however this would be offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments we are currently holding capital at our insurance subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our longterm requirements we expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through our statutory earnings while we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to risk management we believe we are well positioned with substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated each periodinvestmentsoverviewour investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur we believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio including credit and interest rate management has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our resultsbelow is a summary of our formal investment policy including the overall quality and diversification objectives the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfoliosthe longterm nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns a maximum of 10 percent of the total

directors and must be approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries see critical accounting estimates contained in this item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investmentsinvestment results net investment income was slightly lower in 2012 relative to 2011 due primarily to a decline in yield on invested assets an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships and lower income on our unum uk inflation indexlinked bonds these declines were partially offset by a higher level of invested assets higher bond call premiums an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities net investment income increased slightly in 2011 relative to 2010 due primarily to continued growth in invested assets and higher bond call premiums partially offset by an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our to tax credit partnerships a decrease in income on other partnership investments and lower prepayment income on mortgagebacked securitiesthe duration weighted book yield on the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was 647 percent as of december 31 2012 compared to a yield of 667 percent as of december 31 2011 we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match with the objective of reducing interest rate risk duration is a measure of the percentage change in the fair values of assets and liabilities for a given change in interest rates cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates  to assess the impact of a duration mismatch we measure the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change in interest rates to quantify a dollar value change although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk our determination of investment strategy relies more on longterm measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the

a loss of 112 million on the sale of securities issued by a large us department store chain in 2011 the companys management was replaced by a new team of executives that embarked on a radically different retailing strategy while the company had ample liquidity and sizable value in real estate assets initial operating results under this new strategy have been significantly below market expectations and there is uncertainty as to whether this new strategy will be successful because of this we had concerns that liquidity could be compromised over an extended period of time at the time of disposition these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three yearswe had no individual realized investment losses of 100 million or greater from the sale of fixedmaturity securities during 2011 and 2010 realized investment losses 100 million or greater from otherthantemporary impairmentswe had no individual realized investment losses of 100 million or

company the company recorded significant impairment losses in its securities and real estate portfolios during 2009 and 2008 and required a significant amount of government aid at the time of the impairment loss these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three yearsembedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangementwe report changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement as realized investment gains and losses as required under the provisions of gaap gaap requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us however neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision delinquency proceedings or other direct regulatory action cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down we therefore view the effect of realized gains and losses recognized for this embedded derivative as a reporting requirement that will not result in a permanent change in assets or stockholders equitythe change in fair value of this embedded derivative recognized as a realized gain or loss during 2012 2011 and 2010 resulted primarily from a change in credit spreads in the overall investment market the fair value of this embedded derivative was 839 million at december 31 2012 compared to 1357 million at december 31 2011 and is

under a financial guaranty insurance policy and all such securities are rated investmentgrade absent the guaranty insurance policy at december 31 2012 we held 2128 million fair value 2049 million amortized cost of perpetual debentures or hybrid securities that generally have no fixed maturity date interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrumentat december 31 2012 our mortgageassetbacked securities had an average life of 385 years effective duration of 347 years and a weighted average credit rating of aa1 the mortgageassetbacked securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services one of the risks involved in investing in mortgageassetbacked securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income we have no exposure to subprime mortgages alta loans or collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolios we have not invested in mortgagebacked derivatives such as interestonly principalonly or residuals where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates the credit quality of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans the change in value of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agencybacked mortgagebacked securities as of december 31 2012 the amortized cost and fair value of our belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities was 29906 million and 31593 million respectively belowinvestmentgrade securities are inherently more risky than investmentgrade securities since the risk of default by the issuer by definition and as exhibited by bond rating is higher also the secondary market for certain belowinvestmentgrade issues can be highly illiquid additional downgrades may occur but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in belowinvestmentgrade securities nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturityinvestments in issuers in certain european countries and other countries with risk of sovereign defaultour investments are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize nonmarket risks in our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses for each security we consider the political legal and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates the country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuers headquarters in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived we continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure including that within certain countries in the european union specifically greece ireland italy portugal and spain our monitoring is heightened for investments in these specific countries due to our concerns over the current economic and political environments as well as the banking crisis and we believe these investments are more vulnerable to potential credit problems we have neither direct nor indirect exposure to sovereign debt of any other countries for which we believe there is a heightened risk of sovereign defaultwe do not have foreign currency risk as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities we have no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries and have not used credit derivatives to hedge our exposure or to sell credit protection 79european fixed maturity securities exposure  by country as of december 31 2012in millions of dollars  fair value amortized

percent of its revenue from greece and was rated investmentgrade as of december 31 2012 the company aggregates cash and manages its debt payments outside the country in which it is domiciled which we believe enables the company to place low reliance on the banking system of greece the company intends to change its domicile to switzerland pending required shareholder approval as of december 31 2012 this company was current on its obligations to us and we believe it will continue to meet its debt obligationsirelandwe have no direct exposure to irish financial institutions in november 2010 ireland received a support package valued at 85 billion from the international monetary fundeuropean union based on its plan of recovery thus far ireland appears committed to fiscal consolidation however we believe there are risks associated with the austerity and recessionary pressures as of december 31 2012 all of our irish investments were current on their obligations to us and we believe they will continue to meet their debt obligations for those securities in an unrealized loss position we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value as a result we did not recognize any

and future aid may be required as of december 31 2012 our singular holding domiciled in portugal is a geographically diversified utility company that was downgraded to belowinvestmentgrade during the first quarter of 2012 as of december 31 2012 this company was current on its obligations to us and we believe it will continue to meet its debt obligations80spainwe have no direct exposure to spanish financial institutions although we do own fixed maturity securities of a certain united kingdom subsidiary of a spanish financial institution we believe there are risks associated with spains high unemployment large budget deficit banking sector problems recessionary pressures and potential regional secession issues all but one of our spanish domiciled securities were rated investmentgrade as of december 31 2012 and all were current on their obligations to us we believe they will continue to have the ability to meet their debt obligations for those securities in an unrealized loss position we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value as a result we did not recognize any otherthantemporary impairment losses on these investments as of december 31 2012risk managementwhile we have no direct sovereign holdings in the aforementioned countries we have performed comprehensive stress testing and scenario analyses on all of our corporate holdings of issuers domiciled in these countries we have performed stress tests under a number of scenarios including deep recession liquidity crisis and currency redenomination with significant devaluation we continue to closely monitor this situationpotential risks for these corporate holdings include a lack of access to credit in their countries of domicile and redenomination risk as it pertains to their outstanding liabilities under either of these scenarios we believe the risk is largely mitigated because our holdings in these countries are nonfinancial and operate in defensive industries that provide essential services most are market leaders with access to diverse global capital markets current developments regarding ratings downgrades bailout packages or higher sovereign interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsmortgage loansour mortgage loan portfolio was 17127 million and 16123 million on an amortized cost basis at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low due to conservative underwriting we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry we held two mortgage loans at december 31 2012 and 2011 which were considered impaired and were carried at the estimated net realizable values of 174 million and 225 million respectively net of a valuation allowance of 15 million at each period endderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment risk duration and currency risk historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held was 87 million at december 31 2012 we held no cash collateral from our counterparties at december 31 2012 the carrying value of cash and fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 18 million and 1086 million respectively at december 31 2012 we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties all of which have a median credit rating of a3 or better and by our use of crosscollateralization agreementsotherour exposure to noncurrent investments defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest andor principal payments totaled 633 million and 586 million on a fair value basis at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectivelysee notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments81liquidity and capital resourcesour liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations principally in our insurance subsidiaries premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash debt andor securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits costs of acquiring new business principally commissions operating expenses and taxes as well as purchases of new investments we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business however deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities which may negatively impact our cash flows furthermore if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries this will negatively impact statutory capital which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations however our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent even during cycles of economic downturns which serves to minimize liquidity riskwe have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by erisa we made a voluntary contribution of 530 million to our us qualified defined benefit plan during 2012 and we expect to make contributions of approximately 500 million during 2013 we have estimated our future funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 and do not believe that the funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity we also contribute to our uk pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation we made required contributions of 26 million during 2012 and we expect to make contributions of approximately 26 million during 2013 in august 2012 we issued 2500 million of senior notes these notes due in 2042 bear interest at a fixed rate of 575 and are payable semiannually the net proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposesin may 2010 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5000 million of unum groups common stock with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash alternative uses for cash and our stock price the 5000 million share repurchase program had an expiration date of may 2011 in february 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 billion of unum groups common stock in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the 5000 million authorization the 10 billion share repurchase program had an expiration date of august 2012 in july 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500 million of unum groups common stock the 7500 million share repurchase program has an expiration date of january 2014 and replaced the previous authorization of 10 billion that was scheduled to expire in august 2012  during 2011 we repurchased 71 million shares at a cost of 2000 million using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty under the terms of the repurchase agreement we received a price adjustment based on the volume weightedaverage price of our common stock during the term of the agreement the price adjustment resulted in the delivery to us of 06 million additional shares in total we repurchased 77 million shares of our common stock under this agreement which completed the 5000 million repurchase authorization and initiated the 10 billion repurchase program in addition to these repurchases during 2011 we repurchased an additional 177 million shares on the open market at a cost of 4199 million for a total repurchase of 254 million shares during 2011 during 2012 we repurchased 236 million shares on the open market at a cost of 5006 million the dollar value of shares remaining under the 10 billion repurchase program prior to its replacement was 2247 million as previously noted this share repurchase program was superseded and replaced by the 7500 million share repurchase program authorized in july 2012 the dollar value of shares remaining under the 7500 million repurchase program was 5500 million at december 31 201282cash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately 805 million and 756 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the december 31 2012 balance of which 193 million was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the uk was comprised primarily of commercial paper fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of 15 years and various moneymarket funds no significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds we currently have no intent nor do we foresee a need to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries in the uk we believe we hold domestic resources sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and that our current level of holding company cash and marketable securities can be utilized to mitigate potential losses from defaults if we repatriate additional funds from our subsidiaries in the uk the amounts repatriated would be subject to repatriation tax effects which generally equal the difference in the us tax rate and the uk tax rate unum limited will be impacted by new capital requirements and risk management standards under solvency ii the effective adoption date of which is expected to be no earlier than january 1 2015 solvency ii requirements have not been fully finalized but the current proposals contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers although the impact of solvency ii cannot be determined at this time its implementation could result in increased capital supervisory and disclosure requirements for our uk subsidiaries our bermudabased insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation by the bma since 2010 the bma has been engaged in a comprehensive review and assessment of its insurance regulatory and solvency framework the impact of the proposed changes cannot be determined at this time nor is the effective adoption date known but the implementation of these requirements could result in increased capital and governance requirements for our bermudabased insurance subsidiary see capital requirements contained herein in item 1 for additional information during 2013 we intend to retain a level of capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average rbc level well above capital adequacy requirements we also expect both unum limited and our bermudabased insurance subsidiary to operate above their respective capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency marginsas requirements of doddfrank begin to take effect in 2013 and in subsequent years to the extent that we enter into derivatives that are subject to centralized exchanges and cleared through a regulated clearinghouse we may be subject to stricter collateral requirements which could have an adverse effect on our overall liquidityconsolidated cash flowsoperating cash flowsnet cash provided by operating activities was 13796 million for 2012 compared to 11937 million and 11968 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income offset by payments of claims commissions expenses and income taxes premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales but on renewals of existing business renewal price increases and persistency investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the earned yield the level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business the level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy as previously discussed in the operating results by segment operating cash flows for 2012 2011 and 2010 include pension and other postretirement benefit contributions of approximately 743 million 203 million and 1882 million the variance in the income tax adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to both the prior and subsequent years was due primarily to decreases in the deferred tax liability related to the 2011 deferred acquisition cost charge and reserve charges for our longterm care and individual disability closed blocks of business investing cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments net cash used by investing activities was 11134 million for 2012 compared to 4103 million and 10737 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively83proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 as we had ample liquidity provided from other sources primarily maturities of availableforsale securities proceeds from maturities of availableforsale securities were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a significant increase in proceeds from bond calls and prepayments on mortgagebacked securities proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities were slightly higher in 2011 compared to 2010 proceeds from maturities of availableforsale securities were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a significant decrease in bond calls proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in proceeds from terminations of derivative contracts within our cash flow hedging programs and an increase in maturities from mortgage loans partially offset by a decrease in distributions received from private equity partnerships proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments were slightly lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a decrease in maturities from mortgage loans offset by an increase in distributions received from private equity partnerships and an increase in proceeds from terminations of derivative contracts within our cash flow hedging programs purchases of availableforsale securities were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an increase in funds available for reinvestment during 2012 resulting from maturities of fixed maturity securities as previously noted we also moved cash out of shortterm investments and into fixed maturity securities during the year purchases of availableforsale securities were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the decline in funds available for reinvestment due to the decrease in bond calls as previously noted purchases of other investments increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in funding of mortgage loans and decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of a decrease in funding of mortgage loans partially offset by a slight increase in funding of tax credit partnerships net purchases of shortterm investments decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to our use of available cash to purchase fixed maturity securities partially offset by an increase in available funds from cash collateral received under our securities lending program net purchases of shortterm investments decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to our use of cash to fund the payment for our debt maturing in 2011 in both 2012 and 2011 cash received from the disposition of shortterm investments provided funding for our share repurchases financing cash flowsfinancing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt issuance or repurchase

we received proceeds of 2500 million less debt issuance costs of 22 million and a debt discount of 14 million from the issuance of 2500 million of 575 senior notes during 2012 and 2011 the balance outstanding under our securities lending program increased by 1435 million and 3123 million respectively we did not utilize our securities lending program during 2010 during 2012 2011 and 2010

respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by northwind re and tailwind re  the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiarys board of directorsthe amount available during 2012 for the payment of ordinary dividends from unum groups traditional us insurance subsidiaries was 6344 million of which 6000 million was declared and paid the amount available during 2012 from unum limited was 1870 million of which 750 million was declared and paid to one of our uk holding companies during 2012 tailwind re and northwind re paid dividends of 169 million and 830 million to tailwind holdings and northwind holdings respectivelyalthough we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends based on the restrictions under current law 6237 million is available during 2013 for the payment of ordinary dividends to unum group from its traditional us insurance subsidiaries which excludes northwind re and tailwind re our special purpose financial captive insurance companies approximately 1447 million is available for the payment of dividends from unum limited to unum group andor our uk holding companies during 2013 subject to regulatory approvalunum groups rbc ratio for its traditional us insurance subsidiaries calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula was approximately 396 percent at december 31 2012 compared to 405 percent at december 31 2011 the individual rbc ratios for northwind re and tailwind re are calculated using the naic company action level formula and have target levels of 200 percent both northwind re and tailwind re are approximately at their target levels the individual rbc ratio for each of our insurance subsidiaries is above the range that would require state regulatory actionthe ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries and additional factors such as rbc ratios and fsa capital adequacy requirements funding growth objectives at an affiliate level and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from noninsurance subsidiaries except where the noninsurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum group we intend to retain a level of capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average rbc level above capital adequacy requirements we also expect unum limited to operate above fsa capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins85debtat december 31 2012 we had shortterm debt of 4558 million consisting entirely of securities lending agreements and longterm debt of 27554 million consisting primarily of senior secured notes and junior subordinated debt securities our leverage ratio when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital was 304 percent at december 31 2012 compared to 287 percent at december 31 2011 our leverage ratio when calculated excluding the nonrecourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings and the shortterm debt arising from securities lending agreements was 253 percent at december 31 2012 compared to 235 percent at december 31 2011 the increase in our consolidated debt to total consolidated capital leverage ratio is due primarily to the issuance of 2500 million senior notes in august 2012 and the increase in shortterm debt related to securities lending agreements outstanding at december 31 2012 partially offset by our principal payments on the debt of northwind holdings and tailwind holdings during 2012 leverage is measured as total debt to total capital which we define as total longterm and shortterm debt plus stockholders equity excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges we believe that a leverage ratio which excludes the net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges both of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends and which also excludes the nonrecourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings and the shortterm debt arising from securities lending is a better indicator of our ability to meet our financial obligationswe monitor our compliance with our debt covenants there are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations we remain in compliance with all debt covenants and have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants purchases and retirement of debtin 2011 we made debt repayments of 2251 million at the maturity date of our remaining 7625 senior notes due march 2011 in 2010 we purchased

obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services and related functions and software maintenance agreements the aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was 356 million at december 31 2012 as part of our regular investing strategy we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date for both types of transactions we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral generally cash is received as collateral under these agreements in the event that securities are received as collateral we are not permitted to sell or repost them we also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date see transfers of financial assets as follows for further discussion to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held was 87 million at december 31 2012 we post fixed maturity securities or cash as collateral to our counterparties fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of 1086 million and cash of 18 million were posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2012 our derivatives counterparties have posted noncash collateral in various segregated custody accounts to which we have a security interest in the event of counterparty default this collateral which is not reflected in the preceding table had a fair value of 589 million at december 31 2012transfers of financial assets to manage our cash position more efficiently we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions we generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for shortterm general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days we post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later specified date the fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash received 89as previously noted our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements which increase our investment income with minimal risk we account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings we had 4558 million of securities lending agreements outstanding which were collateralized by cash at december 31 2012 and were reported as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets the cash received as collateral was reinvested in shortterm investments the average balance during the year ended december 31 2012 was 4310 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 4671 million in addition at december 31 2012 we had 145 million of offbalance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control the average balance of these offbalance sheet transactions during 2012 was 157 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 169 millionwe had no repurchase agreements outstanding at december 31 2012 the average balance during the year ended december 31 2012 was 27 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 162 million our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position the availability of longterm investments that meet our purchasing criteria and our general business needs ratingsam best fitch moodys and sampp are among the

adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force negatively impact persistency and new sales particularly large case group sales and
