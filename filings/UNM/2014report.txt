portfolio of products and services through the workplace specifically we offer group individual and voluntary benefits either as standalone products or combined with other coverages that help employers of all sizes attract and retain a stronger workforce while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees we believe employersponsored benefits represent the single most effective way to provide workers with access to the information and options they need to protect their financial stability working people and their families particularly those at lower and middle incomes are perhaps the most vulnerable in todays economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial services and products for many of these people employersponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic fallout of death illness or injury  we have established a corporate culture consistent with the social values our products provide we are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us but also to operating with integrity and being accountable for our actions our sound and consistent business practices strong internal compliance

another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium we undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management if the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations we remain contingently liable in the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure we may also require assets to be held in trust letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers although we have controls to minimize our exposure the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsin general the maximum amount of life insurance risk

80 percent quota share reinsurance on the ceded claims we also have three reinsurance agreements that collectively cede approximately 50 percent of unum us group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our us insurance subsidiaries  these reinsurance agreements for unum us group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory

and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 reserves for policy and contract benefitsthe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report as liabilities policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies these reserves are the amounts which with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables interest rates and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries these differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods the assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable if actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions additional reserves may be required the key experience assumptions include disability claim incidence rates disability claim recovery rates mortality rates policy persistency interest rates and policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred as we believe appropriate 9the consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits the change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses deaths and benefit payments if policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits for further discussion of reserves refer to risk

operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 investmentsinvestment activities are an integral part of our business and profitability is significantly affected by investment results we segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines generally our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses we seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner subject to constraints of quality liquidity diversification and regulatory considerations our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk we may redistribute investments among our different lines of business when necessary to adjust the cash flow andor duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes we use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to risk factors contained herein in

time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other ratingcompetition there is significant competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices and financial strength in the individual and group disability markets we compete in the united states with a limited number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products our principal competitors for our other products including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction include the largest insurance companies in the united states some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claimspaying ratings some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete in the united kingdom we compete for the individual and group products we sell with a number of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers these providers have been aggressively trying to maintain market share in a difficult economic environment characterized by very low interest rates and expense pressures on employers and individuals we believe the need for the types of products we offer is significant in both the united states and the united kingdom individuals and families often live paycheck to paycheck with a considerable chance of being out of work pressure is also mounting on governments as to the sustainability of public assistance based on current penetration levels we believe there is substantial upside growth potentialall areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market there is a risk that purchasers of employee benefits products may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us the effect of competition may as a result adversely affect the persistency of these and other products as well as our ability to sell products in the futurewe must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers we compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings financial strength support services and compensation sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokersfor further discussion refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a 11regulation  we and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive and comprehensive supervision and regulation both in the united states and in the united kingdom the laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change new or existing laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as a result of the financial market and economic challenges over the past few years regulation and the cost of compliance with regulation has continued to increaseinsurance regulation and oversightour us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business and by the us department of labor dol on a national basis primarily for the protection of policyholders state insurance departments in the us generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including the power to license and examine insurance companies regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct license agents and brokers approve policy forms approve premium rates for certain insurance products establish reserve requirements and solvency standards place limitations on shareholder dividends prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments and regulate reinsurance transactions our us insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business the domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing such as market conduct issues examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct such as a review of a sales practices including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers as well as underwriting claims and customer service practices and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers the dol enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plansour uk insurance subsidiary unum limited is subject to dual regulation by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca both of which replaced the financial services authority fsa effective april 1 2013 the pra oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and daytoday supervision of insurance companies the fca seeks to protect consumers and takes over the authority in that area previously exercised by the fsa in overseeing financial services products and practices including those governing insurance companies in the uk capital requirementsriskbased capital rbc standards for us life insurance companies have been prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic the domiciliary states of our us insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the rbc model formula of the naic which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers the basis of the system is a riskbased formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurers business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer the life and health rbc formula is designed to measure annually i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks the formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized the formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally the naics solvency modernization initiative smi began in june 2008 the smi is a selfexamination of the united states insurance solvency regulation framework and includes a review of international developments regarding insurance supervision banking supervision and international accounting standards and their potential use in us insurance regulation the smi is a wideranging initiative that by its nature will evolve to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments current smi goals and the principles developed through the smis exploration of capital requirements governance and risk management group supervision statutory accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance will likely result in significant changes to us insurance regulation and solvency standards including those for our us insurance subsidiaries progress on the various initiatives is expected to continue throughout 2014  12during 2012 the naic established a subgroup to study the insurance industrys use of captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and is considering ways to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers we are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the naics study although we believe it to be unlikely a potential outcome of the naic study is that companies could be prohibited from using captive reinsurers the expected effect of such prohibition would depend on the specific changes to state regulations that might be adopted as a result of the naic study including whether current captive reinsurers would be allowed to continue in existence or if not the method and timing of their dissolution as well as the cost and availability of alternative reinsurance vehicles at this time given the uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of these matters we are unable to estimate the potential impact on our riskbased capital ratios andor liquidity should the use of captive reinsurers be limited or prohibited no changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the naic and it is too early to predict the extent of any changes that might be made accordingly we expect to continue our strategy of using captive reinsurers to manage risks and enhance capital efficiency while monitoring the naics study and proposed changes in regulations see reinsurance contained herein in this item 1 for further discussionthe pra has statutory requirements including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins to which unum limited must adhere current solvency standards require an insurance company to hold capital equal to the greater of i a formulaic calculation of capital related to liabilities or ii a riskbased assessment of capital which is company specific reflecting the insurance companys individual risk profile solvency ii a european union directive that will prescribe new capital requirements and risk management standards that are the result of a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the european insurance industry will replace the current capital requirements for unum limited our european holding company will also be subject to the solvency ii requirements relevant to insurance holding companies and its subsidiaries including unum limited will be subject to group supervision under solvency ii solvency ii requirements have not been fully finalized but the current proposals contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers including i requirements to demonstrate adequate financial resources including quantitative requirements technical provisions and calculation of solvency ii capital requirements through either an approved full or partial internal model or the european standard formula approach ii requirements to demonstrate an adequate system of governance including effective risk management underpinned by prospective risk identification and quantification and iii disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements the effective adoption date is expected to be january 1 2016 the impact of solvency ii on our uk subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time but its implementation could result in increased capital supervisory and disclosure requirements see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources contained herein in item 7 and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 insurance holding company regulationwe and our us insurance subsidiaries excluding captive insurers are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which they are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled which currently include maine massachusetts tennessee south carolina new york and california these laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system including information concerning capital structure ownership management financial condition and certain intercompany transactions transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and if material require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulatorin addition such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders including our company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources  cash available from subsidiaries contained herein in item 7 13there are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect us and our insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level although these changes are only beginning to be adopted by individual state regulators it can be expected that most will ultimately adopt them in some form the various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate governance groupwide supervision of insurance holding companies adjustments to rbc calculations to account for groupwide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies a completed activity within the smi includes the recent adoption by the naic of the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act and the own risk and solvency assessment orsa guidance manual which require insurers to provide a grouplevel perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks we expect to file our orsa summary report with the applicable insurance regulators in 2015the laws of most states including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company where these laws apply to us there can be no effective change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change the usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company although this presumption is rebuttable consequently a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the states of domicile of the insurance companyies sought to be acquired or whose holding company is sought to be acquired will be in violation of these laws such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions i injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the applicable insurance regulators ii prohibition of voting of such shares and iii other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators further many states insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a nondomiciled insurance company doing business in the state these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control however they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted prenotification laws these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of our company including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable federal laws and regulations enacted in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the united states doddfrank directs various government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years among other provisions doddfrank creates a new framework for regulation of the overthecounter derivatives markets including requiring that certain swaps be executed through a centralized exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse and subjecting major swap participants to capital and margin ie collateral requirements which will likely have the effect of increasing the costs of hedging generally and the credit risk posed by some counterparties we use derivative transactions to help us manage certain risks in our business new margin requirements for cleared and uncleared transactions are expected to require the posting of higher margin levels for our derivatives activities and also may narrowly restrict the range of eligible collateral which may require us to hold more of our assets in cash or cash equivalents that generate lower yields than other investments doddfrank also established a financial stability oversight council fsoc with authority to subject systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies such as us to supervision and stricter prudential regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve board including stricter requirements and limitations relating to riskbased capital leverage liquidity stress testing and credit exposure and in certain circumstances limitations on acquisitions or combinations restrictions on product offerings andor requirements to sell assets in april 2012 the fsoc adopted final rules for evaluating whether a nonbank financial company should be designated as systemically important we have not been designated as a systemically important financial company and based on the quantitative criteria set forth in the final rules at this time we believe it is unlikely that we will be subject to such designation  14in addition doddfrank established a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry other than with respect to health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the us financial system and recommending insurers potentially including us that should be designated for stricter regulation in december 2013 the fio released its report on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states the report concludes that modernization and improvement are possible through a combination of steps by states and certain actions by the federal government the report makes recommendations for enhanced uniformity and efficiency by states in the areas of insolvency and marketplace regulation and for direct federal involvement in certain areas such as for the fio to engage in supervisory colleges and also to study and report on the manner in which personal information is used for insurance pricing and coverage purposes we are subject to the laws and regulations generally applicable to public companies including the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange relating to public reporting and disclosure accounting and financial reporting corporate governance and securities trading further the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules and

the patriot act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering antimoney laundering laws outside of the united states contain some similar provisions additionally other federal laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and regulations issued by the office of foreign assets controls as well as the uks bribery act of 2010 have increased requirements relating to identifying customers prohibiting transactions with certain organizations or

wide range of risks and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures discussed below are certain factors that may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company including those in this document or made by us elsewhere such as in earnings release investor calls investor conference presentations or press releases see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1unfavorable economic conditions may result in lower sales lower premium growth and persistency higher claims incidence and longer claims duration which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionwe are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the general economy both in the united states the united kingdom and to a lesser extent the broader global financial markets a challenging business environment and volatile markets persisted through 2013 and may continue in 2014 adversity in the capital markets and the general economy may adversely affect our business and results of operations in particular factors such as unemployment levels consumer confidence levels consumer spending business investment government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and ultimately the amount and profitability of our businesses given the nature of our products in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower personal income reduced consumer spending and lower corporate earnings and investment new product sales may be adversely affected our premium growth may also be negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy in addition during such periods we may experience higher claims incidence longer claims duration andor an increase in policy lapses any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition sustained periods of low interest rates in the longterm investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products and projecting our pension obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition continued low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products an interest or discount rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products we set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in that case the reserves may eventually be insufficient resulting in the need to increase our reserves andor increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs our expectations for the future investment returns of plan assets are based on a combination of historical market performance evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists and current market yields the rate of return on pension plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period declines in longterm interest rates or the fair value of our plan assets may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans andor increased pension costs which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity conversely a rise in interest rates could unfavorably impact the fair value of certain investments in our pension plans see reserves for policy and contract

reserve assumptions which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionin recent years we have experienced volatility in risk results in various lines of business historical results may not be indicative of future performance due to among other things changes in our mix of business repricing of certain lines of business or any number of economic cyclical effects on our business reserves whether calculated under gaap or statutory accounting principles do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures actual claim experience may differ from our reserve assumptions there can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances future loss development may require reserves to be increased which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods life expectancies may continue to increase which could lengthen the time a claimant receives disability or longterm care benefits and could result in a change in mortality assumptions and an increase in reserves for these and other longtailed products adjustments to reserve amounts may also be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity the incidence of claims and the rate of recovery including the

which may affect the cost or demand for our products increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and adversely affect our profitability liquidity or growth our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the united states and abroad the primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders not stockholders to that end applicable laws establish regulatory authorities including state insurance departments in the united states and the pra in the united kingdom with broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business for example our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses permits authorizations or accreditations or may be able to do so only at great cost in addition we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with or obtain appropriate exemptions from the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly reexamined existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations for example they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us restrict transactions between subsidiaries andor between us and our subsidiaries and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationsit is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate we cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted or what impact if any such proposals or if enacted such laws could have on our business results of operations or financial condition the naic or state regulators may adopt revisions to the rbc formula the pra may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries increased financial services regulation such as the naic solvency modernization initiative and the european commissions solvency ii directive may impose greater quantitative requirements supervisory review and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies capital requirements and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries new programs including healthcare reform and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace for example although the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca reforms the business of health insurance and does not directly affect our insurance products we believe it has indirectly led to lower product sales in recent periods as the attention of our brokers agents and customers has been diverted toward compliance with the legislation 19we use affiliated captive reinsurers for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency if we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurers or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangements our ability to maintain current riskbased capital rbc ratios andor our capital deployment activities could be adversely affected no changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the naic and it is too early to predict the potential impact of any changes that might be madelegislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability changes in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes furthermore the value of deferred tax assets could be impacted by our future earnings levels changes in tax laws could also make some of our products less attractive to consumers we cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether if at all any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations doddfrank directs existing and recently created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years as a result of the regulations implemented thus far regulations directed at some derivative activities and the implementation of central clearing rules have increased the cost of some hedging activities primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements we cannot predict the requirements of the remaining regulations that will ultimately be adopted or how or whether such regulations will affect our businesses results of operations cash flows or financial condition require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings most group longterm and shortterm disability plans we administer are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa changes to erisa enacted by congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans increase the premiums associated with such plans and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitabilitythe insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates andor benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees these regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices are improper these actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationsregulatory examinations or investigations could result in among other things changes in our claims handling or other business practices changes in procedures for the identification and payment to the states of benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners changes in the use and oversight of reinsurance increases to reserving requirements changes in governance and other oversight procedures assessments by tax authorities or other governing agencies fines and other administrative action which could injure our reputation adversely affect our issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies andor have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition determination by regulatory authorities that we have engaged in improper conduct may also adversely affect our defense of various lawsuits see regulation contained herein in item 1 and notes 7 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionin addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditydefault riskour investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities these securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer a regulatory change pertaining to the issuers industry a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the issuer widening risk spreads ratings downgrades a change in the issuers marketplace or business prospects or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations  20our mortgage loan portfolio has default risk events or developments such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents or limit the availability of refinancing may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector a default results in the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment loss on the investment a default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us the probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience periods of volatility and illiquidity credit spread riskour exposure to credit spreads which is the yield above comparable treasury securities primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads a widening of credit spreads may unfavorably impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of the investment portfolio and may adversely impact liquidity credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities valuation riskwe report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at fair value valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation particularly during periods of market disruption resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold further rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments there can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken additional impairments may need to be taken in the future and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionmarket timing and liquidity riskwhile we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business there may at times be a lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired in addition we may in certain circumstances need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs there may also be a limited market for certain of our investments such as our private placement fixed maturity securities mortgage loans and policy loans which makes them more illiquid in periods of market volatility or disruption other of our securities may also experience reduced liquidity if events occur wherein we need to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or credit environment or need to quickly sell securities which are illiquid market prices may be lower than what we might realize under normal circumstances with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our investments and derivatives  21the failure of cyber or other information security systems as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition we rely heavily on the effective operation of our information technology systems to administer almost every aspect of our business we also store confidential policyholder and employee information and other proprietary information on our systems as a part of our normal business operations these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control we maintain security systems and implement measures to protect our information technology systems and data but they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering these threats may originate externally such as from cyber criminals or other hackers or internally from within our company such as from employee error or malfeasance in some cases we may be unaware of emerging threats and the magnitude of their effects or we may not become aware of a cyber incident for some time after it occurs which could increase our exposurein the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an epidemic a cyber attack cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure a terrorist attack or war unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data in addition in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised the failure of our information technology andor disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers operations and result in the loss theft or failure to maintain the security confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data including personal information relating to our customers such a failure could harm our reputation subject us to regulatory sanctions legal claims and increased expenses lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely impact our profitability and our business while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides coverage for network security privacy liability technology errors and omissions media liability first party network business interruption electronic restoration and cyber extortion including sublimits for credit monitoring notification costs regulatory expense and investigative expense our insurance may not provide adequate loss coverage in all circumstancesthe effectiveness of our hedging programs may be affected by changes in the economic environment changes in interest rates capital market volatility nonperformance by our counterparties changes in the level of required collateral or regulation which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditywe use derivative financial instruments to help us manage certain risks related to our business operations primarily interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities and foreign currency risk factors associated with derivative financial instruments could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity ineffectiveness of our hedges due to changes in expected future events such as the risk created by uncertainty in the economic environment or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of nonperformance by our counterparties many of which are financial institutions nonperformance by our counterparties may force us to unwind hedges and we may be unable to replace the hedge thereby leaving the risk unhedged under the terms of our hedging contracts we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral which may adversely affect our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute hedging strategies due to the increased economic cost of derivatives primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements  22competition may adversely affect our market share or profitability all of our businesses are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength and claimspaying ratings we compete for new product sales the retention of existing business and the ability to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products all of which affect our profitability the level and intensity of competition may grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive new competitors entering the market including those who enter the market as a result of healthcare reform and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result in larger competitors with greater financial resources there are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business and there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future which may adversely affect our market share or profitability see competition contained herein in item 1 for further discussiona decrease in our financial strength or issuer credit ratings may adversely affect our competitive position our ability to hedge our risks and our cost of capital or ability to raise capital which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditywe compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies a downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially among other things adversely affect relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force negatively impact persistency and new sales and generally adversely affect our ability to compete a downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to unum group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital if we are downgraded significantly ratings triggers in our derivatives financial instrument contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the derivative contracts such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks see ratings contained herein in item 1 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 for further discussionevents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionthere are many events which may harm our reputation including but not limited to those discussed in this item 1a regarding regulatory investigations legal proceedings and cyber or other information security incidents in addition as an insurance company we are paid to accept certain risks those who conduct our business including executive officers and members of management sales managers investment professionals and to some extent independent agents and brokers do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk these include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities delivering effective technology solutions complying with established sales practices executing our capital management strategy exiting a line of business andor pursuing strategic growth initiatives and other decisions although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective if our employees and business associates take excessive risks andor fail to comply with internal policies and practices the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation depending on the severity of the damage to our reputation we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital andor increase our cost of capital see regulation contained herein in item 1 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on regulatory matters and legal proceedings 23we provide a broad array of disability longterm care group life and voluntary insurance products that are affected by many factors and changes in any of those factors may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity disability insurancedisability insurance may be affected by a number of social economic governmental competitive and other factors changes in societal attitudes such as work ethic motivation or stability can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products both economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies the relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price underwrite and adjudicate the claims within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates however these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time the pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes our individual noncancelable disability policies in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium do not permit us to adjust premiums on our inforce business guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market longterm care insurancelongterm care insurance can be affected by a number of demographic medical economic governmental competitive and other factors because longterm care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is longduration in nature there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products this creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves longterm care insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but the repricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside which can affect the length of time in which the repricing can be implemented if at all we monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity mortality and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves mortality continues to improve for the general population and life expectancy has increased which could lengthen the time a claimant receives longterm care benefits and may subject more policyholders to advanced aging and an associated increase in claims incidence medical advances may continue to have an impact on claim incidence and duration both favorable and unfavorable due to the long duration of the product the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities sustained periods of low interest rates could result in increases in reserves and adversely affect our results of operations group life insurancegroup life insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily our risk selection process our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics the geographical concentration of employees and mortality rates claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks natural disasters and pandemic health events which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage there are a series of lawsuits challenging the use of retained asset accounts in group life plans that are governed by erisa if these challenges are upheld by the courts our ability to use such accounts for the beneficiaries of these plans may be adversely affected  24voluntary productsvoluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect our risk selection process and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics our voluntary life insurance products generally include interestsensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate it is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate the nonlife contracts are guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products see reserves for policy and contract benefits contained herein in item 1 and executive summary and critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 for further discussion our risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk which could negatively affect our businesswe have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program which has the objective of managing our strategic market credit insurance operations capital and liquidity and reputational risks however our program may not be comprehensive and our methods for monitoring and managing risk may not fully predict or mitigate future exposures see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained herein in item 7a for further information about our risk management program litigation and contingencies are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses andor harm to our reputation we are and in the future may be defendants in a number of litigation matters and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive and treble damages an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated an adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may depending on the nature scope and amount of the ruling materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition encourage other litigation and limit our ability to write new business particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratingsas part of our normal operations in managing claims we are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages may from time to time have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive lossesbeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established additional reserves for payment of these benefits similar to other insurers we are undergoing an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states we are cooperating fully with this examination as well as with a delaware market conduct examination and a voluntary disclosure agreement process with the state of minnesota the legal and regulatory environment around unclaimed death benefits continues to evolve it is possible that the current examination andor similar investigations by other state jurisdictions may result in additional payments to beneficiaries the payment of abandoned funds under state law andor administrative penalties the total of which may be in excess of the reserves established  25see critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on legal proceedingschanges in accounting standards may materially affect our financial statementsour financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the united states and the united kingdom which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the us financial accounting standards board fasb the uk accounting standards board asb and the naic accounting standards issued by the fasb and asb may be influenced by the international accounting standards board iasb these authoritative bodies have several ongoing projects regarding accounting standards that will likely be adopted in the near future future accounting standards we adopt will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition currency translation could materially impact our reported operating resultsthe functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our financial results in periods when the pound weakens translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period in periods when the pound strengthens translating pounds into dollars increases current period results in relation to the prior period however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk our ability to finance our ongoing operations may not always be possible solely from internal sources of capital and liquidity if we need to seek external capital there is the risk that adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital or our cost of capitala change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations deterioration in the credit market which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner could also negatively impact our cash flows regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this item 1a may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries increase collateral requirements for certain of our derivatives transactions andor implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity without sufficient liquidity our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms or at all which may adversely affect us if our financial results are unfavorable we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the us the pra in the uk and the rating agencies that rate insurers claimspaying abilities and financial strength failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by the rating agencies need for additional capital may limit a subsidiarys ability to distribute funds to our holding companiesobtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be complicated in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty the markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers the availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in unum group  26we rely on our credit facility as a potential source of liquidity our right to borrow funds under this facility is subject to financial covenants negative covenants and events of default our ability to borrow under this facility is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the

conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance reduce our results of operations accordingly we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which may adversely affect our ability to write future business result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue and increase our capital requirements the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers we cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have assets which may not be fully recoverable or realizable which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionif our business does not perform well or as initially anticipated in our assumptions we may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment loss on intangible assets or longlived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset we have intangible assets such as deferred acquisition costs dac value of business acquired voba and goodwill dac and voba are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies recoverability testing for dac and voba is performed on an annual basis insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring servicing and measuring profitability of the contracts if recoverability testing indicates that either dac andor voba are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense goodwill is not amortized but on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors in accordance with accounting guidance we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below in addition certain events including but not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually  27longlived assets including assets such as real estate and information technology software also require impairment testing to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we may be unable to recover the carrying amount we assess our deferred tax assets to determine if they are realizable factors in our determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income if based on available information it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to net income charges such as accelerated amortization impairment losses or the establishment of valuation allowances could have a material adverse effect on

may adversely affect the value of certain assets in our investment portfolio disrupt our operations or result in higher claim costs the continued threat of terrorism both within the us and abroad ongoing military actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility in the global financial markets and result in loss of life property damage business disruption and reduced economic activity some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism terrorist actions also could disrupt our operations centers in the us or abroad in addition the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated beyond obtaining insurance coverage for our facilities there are few if any commercial options through which to transfer the exposure from extreme events away from us we purchase reinsurance protection against catastrophic disaster events including terrorism the continued threat of terrorism could result in increased reinsurance prices and reduced insurance coverage and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices see reinsurance contained herein in

included in item 8executive summarythroughout 2013 we remained focused on profitable topline growth in select markets and a disciplined investment strategy as we continued to drive effectiveness in our operating performance and to generate consistent sustainable capital available for deployment a discussion of our operating performance and capital management follows2013 operating performance and capital management for 2013 we reported net income of 8581 million or 323 per diluted common share compared to net income of 8944 million or 317 per diluted common share in 2012 included in these results are net realized investment gains and losses and nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses also included are fourth quarter 2013 adjustments for a reserve increase related to unclaimed death benefits 955 million before tax and 621 million after tax or 024 per diluted common share and a reserve reduction related to group life waiver of premium benefits 850 million before tax and 552 million after tax or 021 per diluted common share adjusting for these items aftertax operating income was 8825 million or 332 per diluted common share in 2013 compared to 8875 million or 315 per diluted common share in 2012 total operating revenue which excludes net realized investment gains and losses was 11 percent lower in 2013 relative to 2012 with slight declines in both premium income and net investment income total operating income excluding net realized investment gains and losses nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses and income taxes decreased by 07 percent compared to 2012 operating income when also excluding the 2013 reserve adjustments related to unclaimed death benefits and group life waiver of premium benefits increased slightly relative to 2012 with favorable earnings in all of our segments other than our corporate segment earnings per share were also favorably impacted by our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock see additional information in 2013 unclaimed death benefits reserve increase 2013 group life waiver of premium benefit reserve reduction consolidated operating results and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained herein in item 7our unum us segment reported an increase in operating income including the 2013 reserve adjustments related to unclaimed death benefits and group life waiver of premium benefits of 25 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 operating income excluding these reserve adjustments increased 14 percent with growth in premium income and overall favorable risk results premium income increased 14 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 as we believe the weak pace of economic growth low levels of employment growth the competitive environment and the distraction caused by political instability and the implementation of healthcare reform continued to pressure our sales and premium income growth throughout 2013 the benefit ratio for our unum us segment for 2013 was 713 percent or 716 percent excluding the reserve adjustments compared to 727 percent in 2012 unum us sales decreased 20 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 although persistency declined slightly during 2013 relative to 2012 our persistency remains strong and is generally consistent with our expectations our unum uk segment reported an increase in operating income as measured in unum uks local currency of 17 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 with overall favorable risk results premium income in local currency declined 188 percent in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to reinsurance agreements entered into effective january 1 2013 to cede an additional portion of our group life business the reinsurance agreements significantly decreased premium income and benefit payments for group life during 2013 and also reduced volatility in this line of business the decline in the benefit ratio for unum uk to 743 percent in 2013 from 779 percent in 2012 was due primarily to improved risk results in the group life product line unum uk sales in 2013 decreased 187 percent in local currency in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower group life sales as we continued to execute our plans to improve new business pricing and reposition our group life business for better margins and greater stability persistency declined as expected primarily as a result of pursuing rate increases on renewing business 32our colonial life segment reported a decrease in operating income including the 2013 reserve increase related to unclaimed death benefits of 35 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 operating income excluding this reserve adjustment increased 39 percent in 2013 with higher operating revenue and stable risk results premium income grew 32 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 the 2013 benefit ratio for colonial life was 541 percent and excluding the reserve increase was 525 percent consistent with the level of 2012 colonial life sales increased 16 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by higher large case commercial market sales persistency in 2013 declined slightly but remains strong for all lines of business our closed block segment reported an increase in operating income of 146 percent in 2013 relative to 2012 net investment income increased 34 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher invested asset levels risk results in 2013 were slightly favorable for both individual disability and longterm care relative to the prior year our investment portfolio continues to perform well and our invested asset quality remains strong the net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was 41 billion at december 31 2013 compared to 72 billion at december 31 2012 with the decline due primarily to an increase in us treasury rates during 2013 we believe our capital and financial positions are strong at december 31 2013 the riskbased capital rbc ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula was approximately 405 percent compared to 396 percent at december 31 2012 during 2013 we repurchased 112 million shares of unum group common stock at a cost of 3186 million under our share repurchase program cash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately 514 million at december 31 2013 relative to 805 million at december 31 2012 the decline was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock and a capital contribution related to our 2013 redomestication of a captive reinsurance subsidiary 2013 unclaimed death benefits reserve increasebeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis we believe adopting this process which reflects an evolving regulatory and industry practice is in the best interest of our customers therefore in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous yearsduring the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established additional reserves for payment of these benefits claim reserves were increased 491 million for unum us group life 263 million for unum us voluntary life and 201 million for colonial life voluntary life for a total reserve increase of 955 million these reserve adjustments decreased net income 621 millionalthough the legal and regulatory environment continues to evolve we believe our decision to adopt this claims practice and establish additional reserves is in the best interests of our customers2013 group life waiver of premium benefit reserve reductionwithin our unum us segment we offer group life insurance coverage which consists primarily of renewable term life insurance and includes a provision for waiver of premium if disabled the group life waiver of premium benefit group life waiver provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insured or the employer on behalf of the insured is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to a disability the group life waiver claim reserve is the present value of future anticipated death benefits reflecting the probability of death while remaining disabled claim reserves are calculated using assumptions based on past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience and are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations the two fundamental assumptions in the development of the group life waiver reserve are mortality and recovery our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry indicate an increase in life expectancies which decreases the ultimate anticipated death benefits to be paid under the group life waiver benefit emerging experience also reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates which also lessens the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insured is disabled  33during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions for our unum us group life waiver reserves and as a result reduced the applicable claim reserves by 850 million and increased net income 552 million 2013 retirement benefit changesin 2013 we adopted plan amendments which freeze participation and benefit accruals in our defined benefit pension plans in the us and uk effective december 31 2013 for the us plans and june 30 2014 for the uk plan as a result of these plan amendments we recognized a net beforetax curtailment gain of 30 million during 2013 because the amendments eliminate all future service accruals subsequent to the effective dates of the amendments we were also required to remeasure the benefit obligations of our pension plans which decreased our net pension liability approximately 330 million during 2013 with a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income less applicable income tax of approximately 115 million concurrent with our amendments to our defined benefit pension plans we adopted amendments to increase the benefits under our defined contribution plans commensurate with the effective dates of the pension plan amendments further discussion is included in consolidated operating results reconciliation of nongaap financial measures segment results investments and liquidity and capital resources contained in this item 7 and in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 82011 longterm care strategic reviewfollowing a comprehensive and strategic review of our longterm care business in february 2012 we announced that we would discontinue selling group longterm care we discontinued selling individual longterm care during 2009 as part of the strategic review and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year we analyzed our reserve assumptions for longterm care in conjunction with our annual loss recognition testing we generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year but more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test included in the analysis was a review of our reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in longterm interest rates which occurred late in 2011 we also considered an updated industry study for longterm care experience which was made available midyear 2011 from the society of actuaries our analysis of this study which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience based on our analysis as of december 31 2011 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates we also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience while our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2011 we determined that deferred acquisition costs of 1960 million were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by 5736 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations these charges decreased our net income 5003 million2011 claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block businessclaim reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business we are now able with a higher degree of confidence to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible there is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered these benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age longer duration disabled claimants which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits as a result of this experience as of december 31 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and as a result increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by 1835 million and decreased net income 1193 million 34outlook for 2014we believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services while we anticipate the environment for 2014 will be somewhat similar to modestly improving from 2013 with belowaverage economic growth relatively low interest rates and continued political uncertainty we have strategies in place which we believe will help us navigate this environment we believe the need for our products and services remains strong and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk actions during 2014 we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and our employees with a focus on quality and simplification of processes and product offerings our strategy will be centered on maintaining a strong customer focus while providing an innovative product portfolio of financial protection choices to deepen employee coverages broaden employer relationships and open new markets we believe that consistent operating results combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital should allow us to meet our longterm financial objectivescritical accounting estimateswe prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements the accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits deferred acquisition costs valuation of investments pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes and contingent liabilities for additional information refer to our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 reserves for policy and contract benefitsreserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us reserves for policy and contract benefits equaled 405 billion and 399 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively or approximately 798 percent and 744 percent of our total liabilities respectively reserves ceded to reinsurers were 68 billion and 67 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets  policy reservespolicy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums allowing a margin for expenses and profit these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interestsensitive products including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment individual disability products in our unum uk segment disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment and individual disability longterm care and other products in our closed block segment the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie loss recognition occurs persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns in establishing policy reserves we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation we do not however establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions 35we perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency thereafter the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing referred to as the gross premium valuation method wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency mortality and morbidity and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance therefore we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains inforce even after a separate claim reserve is established incidence rates in industry standard valuation tables for policy reserves have traditionally included all lives active and disabled in addition the waiver of premium provision provides funding for the policy reserve while a policyholder is disabled as a result the funding mechanisms and the cost of claims are aligned and require a policy reserve to be held while on claim in addition most policies allow for multiple occurrences of claims and a policy reserve is consequently still maintained at the time of claim to fund any potential future claims the policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders reach the terminal age for coverage die or voluntarily lapse the policy policy reserves for unum us unum uk and colonial life products which at december 31 2013 represented approximately 121 percent 01 percent and 99 percent respectively of our total gross policy reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap in applying this method we use as applicable by product type morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions claim resolution rate assumptions and policy persistency assumptions among others to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income we then apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive with a provision for profit allowed policy reserves for our closed block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability individual and group longterm care and certain other products all of which are no longer actively marketed the reserves for individual disability and individual and group longterm care which represented approximately 417 percent of our total gross policy reserves at december 31 2013 are determined using the gross premium valuation method reserves for individual disability are based on assumptions established as of january 1 2004 the date of loss recognition reserves for longterm care are based on assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of loss recognition key assumptions are persistency mortality claim incidence claim resolution rates commission rates and maintenance expense rates we apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive with no provision for future profit the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business under the gross premium valuation method we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business annually or more frequently if appropriate policy reserves for certain other products excluding individual disability and individual and group longterm care which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our closed block segment represent 58 billion on a gross basis or approximately 362 percent of our total policy reserves we have ceded 46 billion of these other products policy reserves to reinsurers the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable we continue to service a block of group pension products which we have not ceded and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilitiesclaim reservesclaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and as prescribed by gaap equals our longterm best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim such as the benefits available under the applicable policy the covered benefit period and the age and occupation of the claimant as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate reserves for ibnr claims similar to incurred claim reserves include our assumptions for  36claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions including claim reporting patterns the average cost of claims and the expected volumes of incurred claims our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptionsclaim reserves unlike policy reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate if we believe based on our actual experience and our view of future events that our longterm assumptions need to be modified we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period incomemultiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method the paid development method the incurred loss development method the count and severity method and the expected claim cost method no single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reservesclaim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability product lines and our closed block individual disability and individual and group longterm care product lines represent approximately 353 percent and 472 percent respectively of our total claim reserves at december 31 2013 we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual longterm disability and group and individual longterm care claims that have been reported under the tabular reserve methodology reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants such as age length of time disabled and medical diagnosis we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate longterm liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim ibnr claim reserves for our longterm products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs for unum us group shortterm disability products an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted as well as ibnr claims is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our longterm products using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our longterm liabilities and results in less estimation variability claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately 37 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2013 claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid ibnr death claims and a liability for waiver of premium benefits the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately 100 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2013 and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience adjusted for unum uks own experience the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have shortterm benefits which generally have less estimation variability than our longterm products because of the shorter claim payout period our claim reserves for colonial lifes lines of business which approximate 17 percent of our total claim reserves at december 31 2013 are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are 1 the timing rate and amount of estimated future claim payments and 2 the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims  37the following table displays policy reserves incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves by major product line with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our longterm care products ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products the ibnr and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis impacting year

59260                consolidated          461790 70209 391581key assumptionsthe calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are 1 the discount rate 2 the claim resolution rate and 3 the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves of these assumptions our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 1the discount rate which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in this case the reserves may eventually be insufficient we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield2the claim resolution rate used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the probability that a disability or longterm care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time claim resolution assumptions involve many factors including the cause of disability the policyholders age the type of contractual benefits provided and the time since initially becoming disabled we primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience  393the incidence rate used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured the insureds occupation or industry the benefit plan design and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors reserves particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for longterm disabilities and longterm care are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion the impact of internal and external events such as changes in claims operational procedures economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence the emergence of new diseases new trends and developments in medical treatments and legal trends and legislative changes among other factors will influence claim incidence and resolution rates in addition for policies offering coverage for disability or longterm care at advanced ages the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line additionally in any period and over time our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our longterm assumptions either singularly or collectively and these variances may offset each other we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a longterm view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption but rather in the aggregate by product line the following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions in aggregate for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for either favorable or unfavorable trends in key assumptionsgenerally we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time we have historically experienced an increase in our group longterm disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period particularly in our unum us operations during 2012 and 2011 claim incidence rates for unum us group longterm disability were slightly elevated relative to the level of 2010 but in 2013 incidence rates improved slightly returning to the level of 2010 we expect that claim incidence trends for unum us group longterm disability may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general us workforceduring 2013 and 2012 claims incidence was elevated for our closed block longterm care line of business as compared to the longterm assumptions we established at the time of loss recognition in 2011 we view the elevated incidence as temporary in nature see 2011 longterm care strategic review contained in this item 7 throughout the period 2011 to 2013 actual new money interest rates varied with the changing market conditions and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves during this period generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines in 2011 longterm interest rates declined significantly due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve boards actions interest rates improved somewhat in 2013 but continue to remain low relative to historical norms reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the longduration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of businessduring 2013 we updated our mortality and interest rate assumptions for our closed block group pension line of business to reflect recent trends the updated assumptions resulted in an immaterial increase to our group pension reserves the retirement rate experience has remained stable and consistent with expectations  40claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately claim resolution rates in our unum us group and individual longterm disability product lines and our closed block individual disability product line have over the last several years exhibited some variability relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business actual quarterly rates during 2012 and 2013 have varied by 3 and 3 percent in our unum us group longterm disability line of business between 8 and 10 percent in our unum us individual disability  recently issued line of business and between 4 and 4 percent in our closed block individual disability line of business claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time throughout the period 2011 to 2013 our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our longterm assumptions our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period both favorably and unfavorably regarding experience for our older age longer duration disabled claimants in our closed block individual disability line of business the claim resolution rates primarily as pertaining to life expectancy of the insured remained relatively consistent during 2013 and 2012 with the mortality assumptions for this particular claim block that we updated in 2011 see 2011 claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business contained in this item 7 we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate in our estimation scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions when modeled together in aggregate could produce a potential result either positive or negative in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our claim reserve balance by  33 percent using our actual claim reserve balance at december 31 2013 this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of 240 million to our claim reserves using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our closed block individual disability line of business the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by  23 percent of our reported balance which at december 31 2013 would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of 230 million to our claim reserves the major contributor to the variance for both the unum us group longterm disability line of business and the closed block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate in addition we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to longterm care policy reserves these reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of loss recognition assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient  as such positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge policy reserves for longterm care are based upon a number of key assumptions and each assumption has various factors which may impact the longterm outcome key assumptions with respect to morbidity mortality persistency interest rates and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates for example a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate over the lifetime of this business would impact reserves by approximately 400 million with all other factors held constant key assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves for example changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases andor morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health andor medical breakthroughs there is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions in the aggregate could result in a material impact on our reserve levels but we record our reserves based on our longterm best estimate because these product lines have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs either positive or negative we closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of longterm assumptions deferred acquisition costs dac we defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies deferred costs include certain commissions other agency compensation selection and policy issue expenses and field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral  41approximately 83 percent of our dac relates to traditional non interestsensitive products and we amortize dac for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies dac related to interestsensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are persistency premium income and for our interestsensitive products mortality margins and investment returns we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions for traditional products the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy during 2013 our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2013 did not change materially from those used in 2012 generally we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time the following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years 3 10 and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred and our dac balances as of december 31 2013 and 2012    balance remaining as a  dac balances amortization of initial deferral at december 31 period year 3 year 10 year 15 2013 2012unum us        in millions of

reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to the anticipated experience any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur as an example for our traditional products we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our dac accounting policy  42fair value of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as availableforsale and are reported at fair value our derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities which are also reported at fair valuefair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the types of investments we hold the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value the market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades price quotes from third party pricing vendors price quotes we obtain from outside brokers matrix pricing discounted cash flow and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputsinputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique we use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstancescertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active marketas of december 31 2013 the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below where appropriate we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change risk free interest rates of 174 percent for fiveyear maturities to 397 percent for 30year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities this compares to interest rates of 072 percent for fiveyear maturities to 295 percent for 30year maturities used at december 31 2012 current baa corporate bond spread adjustments ranging from 101 percent to 210 percent were added to the risk free rate to reflect additional credit risk and the lack of liquidity we used spread adjustments ranging from 098 percent to 223 percent at december 31 2012 the changes were based on observable market spreads newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums higher than a similar interest rate spread on comparable newly issued public securitiesadditional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for foreign investments certain industries and individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 43as of december 31 2013 approximately 60 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level 1 885 percent as level 2 and 55 percent as level 3 level 1 is the highest category of the threelevel fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs other than those included in the level 1 category that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life the level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 investment impairmentsone of the significant estimates related to investments is our impairment valuation in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate the following factors whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securitywhether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basiswhether the security is current as to principal and interest paymentsthe significance of the decline in valuethe time period during which there has been a significant decline in valuecurrent and future business prospects and trends of earningsthe valuation of the securitys underlying collateralrelevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cyclesmarket conditionsrating agency and governmental actionsbid and offering prices and the level of trading activityadverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investmentschanges in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet dateany other key measures for the related security we evaluate available information including the factors noted above both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we also consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and near term funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a securitywhile determining otherthantemporary impairments is a judgmental area we utilize a formal welldefined and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an otherthantemporary impairmentwe use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation mortgage loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans considering the value of the underlying collateral the value of which is periodically assessed mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 44there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilitiesthe assessment of a borrowers ability to meet its contractual obligations will change the economic outlook either domestic or foreign may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated and as such the investment may not recover in value new information may become available concerning the security such as disclosure of accounting irregularities fraud or corporate governance issues significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industrysignificant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchasedadverse rating agency actions may occursee notes 1 and 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees including nonqualified pension plans the us defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense our uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees the us defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on december 31 2013 and the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on december 31 2002 in 2013 we adopted plan amendments which freeze participation and benefit accruals in our us qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans effective december 31 2013 also in 2013 we adopted amendments to our uk pension plan which freeze participation in the plan effective june 30 2014 and which reduce the maximum rate of inflation indexation from 50 percent to 25 percent for pension benefits which were earned prior to april 1997 effective at the date of adoption assumptionsour net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets we also use as applicable expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits which reflects a health care cost trend rate and the uk pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefitsthe assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans are reviewed annually using a december 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement as occurred in 2013 due to our pension plans amendments the discount rate assumptions and expected longterm rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments actual experience being different from our assumptions special benefits to terminated employees andor changes in benefits provided under the plans the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirementrelated benefit plans to reflect the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs the discount rate we used to determine our net periodic benefit costs for our us pension plans for 2014 was 530 percent and for 2013 was 450 percent for the period january 1 2013 through the date of remeasurement and 500 percent for the period from the date of remeasurement through december 31 2013 the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for our uk pension plan for 2014 was 440 percent and for 2013 was 450 percent for the period january 1 2013 through the date of remeasurement and 460 percent from the date of remeasurement through december 31 2013 the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our opeb plan for 2014 and 2013 was 500 percent and 420 percent respectively   45regarding sensitivity analysis reducing the discount rate assumptions by 50 basis points would have increased our 2013 pension and opeb expenses by approximately 164 million before tax and would have increased our pension and opeb benefit obligations by approximately 1744 million as of december 31 2013 resulting in an aftertax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately 1165 million as of december 31 2013  an increase in the discount rate assumptions of 50 basis points would have decreased our 2013 pension and opeb expenses by approximately 139 million before tax and would have decreased our pension and opeb benefit obligations by approximately 1564 million as of december 31 2013 resulting in an aftertax increase in stockholders equity of approximately 1046 million as of december 31 2013 the longterm rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid the us pension plans use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on their pension plan assets the investment portfolio for our us qualified pension plan contains a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap mid cap and small cap equity securities us government and agency corporate and state and municipal fixed income securities private equity direct investments private equity funds of funds hedge funds of funds and cash equivalents assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds including diversified growth funds which invest in assets such as global equities hedge funds commodities belowinvestmentgrade fixed income securities and currencies as well as leveraged interest rate and inflation swap funds intended to broadly match part of the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the plans liabilities assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily in life insurance contracts we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector with no potential risk concentrations in any one category our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists and current market yields for the us pension plans the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as longterm rates of return volatility of returns and the correlation of returns between various asset classes the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plans current asset allocation investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition  the longterm rate of return on asset assumption used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2014 and 2013 was 750 percent for both years the longterm rate of return on asset assumption used for our uk pension plan for 2014 was 610 percent and for 2013 was 620 percent for the period from january 1 2013 to the date of remeasurement and 635 percent from the date of remeasurement through december 31 2013 the longterm rate of return on asset assumption used for our opeb plan was 575 percent for both years the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period adjusted for contributions and benefit payments a change in the longterm rate of return on asset assumptions on the pension plan assets of 50 basis points would have changed our 2013 pension plan expense by approximately 79 million before tax but would not materially changed our opeb plan expense a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense benefit obligation and fair value of plan assetsthe marketrelated value equals the fair value of assets determined as of the measurement date the return on assets fully recognizes all asset gains and losses including changes in fair value through the measurement date during 2013 the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan increased 2371 million or approximately 175 percent while the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan increased 99 million or approximately 78 percent although the effect of these increases in fair value had no impact on our 2013 net periodic pension costs the favorable rate of return on these plan assets in 2013 and the increase in the liability discount rate for the us plans will have a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for 2014 we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment   46our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of 3687 million and a net unrecognized prior service credit of 24 million which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense as of december 31 2013 the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was 3663 million the unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost our 2013 2012 and 2011 pension and opeb expense includes 279 million 434 million and 288 million respectively of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit cost the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans which is 3790 million at december 31 2013 will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants which is approximately 33 years for us participants and 34 years for uk participants to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor as described below the unrecognized net actuarial gain of 103 million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants estimated at five years to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap the corridor for the pension and opeb plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation at december 31 2013 1691 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the us plan and 87 million was outside of the corridor for the uk plan at december 31 2013 none of the actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the opeb planthe fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was 15907 million at december 31 2013 compared to 13536 million at december 31 2012 the effect of the increase in the liability discount rate and fair value of plan assets as well as the plan amendment contributed to the overfunded plan position of 134 million at december 31 2013 compared to an underfunded position of 4543 million at december 31 2012the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was 114 million at december 31 2013 compared to 115 million at december 31 2012 these assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan our opeb plan represents a nonvested nonguaranteed obligation and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits which are comprised of retiree life medical and dental benefits it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan we expect to continue to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 based on current law to partially offset these payments the expected subsidy included in our consolidated balance sheets is immaterial we discontinued offering retiree life insurance to future retirees effective december 31 2012 we will still provide this benefit to those employees who retired prior to december 31 2012  the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan was 1364 million at december 31 2013 compared to 1265 million at december 31 2012 the uk pension plan was in an overfunded position of 103 million and 53 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively  see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionincome taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in 2011 as part of an internal revenue service irs settlement we released a 41 million valuation allowance related to basis differences in foreign subsidiaries and net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions for which we previously believed we would not realize a tax benefit as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no valuation allowance in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions both domestic and foreign the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability  47gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met  if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effectivesee note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 contingent liabilitieson a quarterly basis we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending in part on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8accounting developmentsin july 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a proposed accounting standards update asu on insurance contracts that is intended to bring greater consistency to the accounting for contracts that transfer significant risk between parties and would require a current measure of insurance contracts including the use of updated assumptions and discounting the proposed asu which would supersede existing guidance on accounting for insurance contracts calls for retrospective application and would prohibit early adoption the proposal did not specify an effective date but instead requested feedback on the appropriate timing for additional information on new accounting standards and the impact if any on our financial position or results of operations see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial

meaningful percentagein describing our results we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures as follows for additional discussion of these items the comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the british pound sterling to dollar exchange rate the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling in periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period as occurred during 2013 and 2012 translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period in periods when the pound strengthens translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period our weighted average pounddollar exchange rate was 1566 1584 and 1603 for years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively if the 2012 and 2011 results for our uk operations had been translated at the exchange rate of 2013 our operating revenue by segment in 2012 and 2011 would have been lower by approximately 108 million and 209 million respectively and our operating income in 2012 and 2011 would have been lower by approximately 14 million and 44 million respectively however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk consolidated premium income for 2013 declined slightly relative to 2012 although we experienced premium growth in our unum us and colonial life segments the level of growth remains below our longterm expectations we believe premium growth in many of our product lines has been unfavorably impacted by the weak pace of economic growth low levels of employment growth the competitive environment and the distraction caused by political instability and the implementation of healthcare reform offsetting the growth in premium income in unum us and colonial life was a decline in premium income due to the reinsurance agreements we entered into during 2013 to cede a portion of certain product lines in unum us individual disability  recently issued and in unum uk consolidated premium income for 2012 increased relative to 2011 and included premium growth for each of our three principal operating business segments although the growth was unfavorably impacted by the same factors pressuring 2013 growth premium income year over year continued to decline as expected in our closed block segment in both 2013 and 2012 further discussion of premium income for each of our segments as well as our outlook for future premium growth is included in segment results as follows 49net investment income was slightly lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to a decline in the yield on invested assets partially offset by a higher level of invested assets miscellaneous net investment income which includes income from bond calls and private equity partnership investments was relatively consistent on a consolidated basis but exhibited more yearoveryear volatility on an operating segment level net investment income was slightly lower in 2012 relative to 2011 due primarily to a decline in yield on invested assets an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships and lower income on our unum uk inflation indexlinked bonds these declines were mostly offset by a higher level of invested assets higher bond call premiums an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities we recognized a net realized investment gain of 68 million in 2013 compared to a gain of 562 million in 2012 and a loss of 49 million in 2011 included in the 2013 net realized gain was a realized investment loss of 300 million recognized on the sale of certain securities during the early part of the third quarter of 2013 when interest rates increased during that time period we sold certain of our lower yielding fixed maturity securities to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment by reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding securities thereby increasing our investment yield and also improving the credit quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio included in the 2011 net realized loss was an otherthantemporary impairment loss on fixed maturity securities of 199 million also included in our realized investment gains and losses is the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement which resulted in a realized gain of 307 million and 518 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and a loss of 394 million in 2011 the consolidated benefit ratios were 865 percent in 2013 compared to 871 percent in 2012 and 959 percent in 2011 excluding the 2013 reserve adjustments in our life insurance product lines within the unum us and colonial life segments the benefit ratio for 2013 was 864 percent and excluding the 2011 reserve adjustments in our closed block segment the benefit ratio for 2011 was 859 percent the underlying risk results in 2013 for each of our principal operating business segments as well as for the majority of our product lines within those segments were favorable or consistent with 2012 the yearoveryear increase in the benefit ratio for 2012 relative to the level of 2011was primarily attributable to adverse risk results in our unum uk group life line of business and in our closed block longterm care line of business risk results in our unum us segment for 2012 were generally consistent with the level reported in 2011 and the benefit ratio for colonial life was only slightly elevated in 2012 compared to 2011 further discussion of our line of business risk results for each of our segments is included in segment results as follows interest and debt expense for 2013 was higher than 2012 due primarily to the issuance of 2500 million of debt in august 2012 offset partially by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt and the purchase and retirement of the debt held by tailwind holdings llc tailwind holdings in january 2013 interest and debt expense for 2012 was slightly higher than 2011 due primarily to the issuance of 2500 million of debt in august 2012 partially offset by the maturity of 2251 million of debt in march 2011the deferral of acquisition costs in 2013 was generally consistent with 2012 the deferral increased in 2012 compared to 2011 with continued growth in certain of our product lines and the associated increase in deferrable expenses more than offsetting the lower level of deferrable costs in product lines with lower growth the amortization of acquisition costs was higher yearoveryear in both 2013 and 2012 due to continued growth in the level of the deferred asset for certain of our product lines and the prospective unlocking for expected future experience relative to assumptions for our interestsensitive life products we also experienced a higher level of policy terminations relative to assumptions for certain issue years within some of our unum us supplemental and voluntary product lines during 2013 at december 31 2011 we determined that our longterm care deferred acquisition costs were not recoverable and we recognized an impairment charge at that time further discussion of deferred acquisition costs and amortization by product line for each of our segments is included in segment results as follows other expenses including compensation expense were in aggregate lower in 2013 and 2012 relative to the prior year periods due in part to our continued focus on operating effectiveness and expense management also contributing to the decline in 2013 relative to 2012 was a reduction in the amortization of our net actuarial loss due to pension plan amendments adopted in 2013 as well as expense reductions associated with reinsurance agreements entered into during 2013 partially offsetting the lower expenses resulting from active expense management were increased costs for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2012 as compared to 2011 for further discussion of the 2013 pension plan amendments see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8  50our income tax for 2013 2012 and 2011 includes reductions of 63 million 93 million and 68 million respectively to reflect the impact of the decrease in the uk corporation tax rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to our uk operations also lowering our income tax rate in 2013 and 2012 relative to the preceding year is an increase in the level of our investments in lowincome housing tax credit partnerships our 2012 income tax includes a release of an 110 million tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits our 2011 income tax includes a reduction in federal income taxes of 413 million due to a final settlement with the irs and an 186 million tax related to the repatriation of 1500 million of dividends from our uk subsidiaries see note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further information on our income tax reconciliation of nongaap financial measureswe analyze our performance using nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures of operating revenue beforetax operating income or beforetax operating loss and aftertax operating income differ from total revenue income before income tax and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below we believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit planswe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a

annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of inforce policies written in prior years as well as current new salessales persistency of

persistency in the group longterm disability product line the weak pace of economic growth low levels of employment growth and competitive environment continue to pressure our premium income growth including growth from existing customers net investment income declined in 2013 relative to 2012 due to decreases in the level of invested assets lower income from bond call premiums and a decrease in

of 40 million on the purchase and retirement of the debt issued by tailwind holdingsrisk results were favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due to favorable claim incidence rates and continued strong claim recovery experience these results were partially offset by the decrease in the discount rate which we implemented during the third quarter of 2012 for new group longterm disability claim incurralsthe deferral and amortization of acquisition costs were both higher in 2013 relative to the prior year due to an increase in deferrable expenses and the resulting continued growth in the

54year ended december 31 2012 compared with year ended december 31 2011premium income increased slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 due to sales growth and generally stable persistency levels high unemployment levels and the competitive environment continued to pressure our premium income growth including growth from existing customers net investment income declined in 2012 relative to 2011 due

on mortgagebacked securities other income for 2012 included fees from administrative services products of 817 million compared to 779 million in 2011 risk results were slightly unfavorable in 2012

benefits were slightly favorable in 2013 compared to the prior year due to favorable experience in the life and critical illness product lines commissions were lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to amounts ceded under the individual disability reinsurance contract previously discussed the deferral of acquisition costs was generally consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2013 compared to the prior year due to a less favorable yearoveryear impact from the prospective unlocking for expected future experience relative to assumptions for our interestsensitive voluntary life products as well as a higher level of policy terminations relative to assumptions for certain issue years within certain of our product lines the other expense ratio in 2013 was higher than 2012 due primarily to lower premium income resulting from the reinsurance contract entered into during 2013 in our individual disability  recently

increase in bond call premiums and other fees and an increase in the level of prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets risk results for the individual disability  recently issued line of business were unfavorable in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to higher submitted incidence rates partially offset by higher claim recoveries risk results for voluntary benefits were favorable in 2012 compared to 2011 driven primarily by the release of active life reserves associated with individual contracts that terminated and bought voluntary group coverage during 2012commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher sales the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to unfavorable persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years within certain of our product lines including the impact on persistency from individual contracts that

relative to 2012 in both markets sales to existing accounts increased in 2013 but this increase was more than offset by a decrease in new account sales the decline in new sales in our group core market was driven by fewer sales opportunities in the smallsize employer market segment during 2013 which we believe may be temporarily attributable to healthcare reform as well as the uncertain economic and political environment we believe the decline in new sales in our large case market was partially due to our disciplined and opportunistic approach to sales growth the sales mix in our group market sector in 2013 was approximately 68 percent core market and 32 percent large case market generally consistent with 2012 sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2013 compared to 2012 with an increase in core market sales partially offset by a decrease in large case market sales new account sales increased during 2013 but were partially offset by a decrease in sales to existing customers primarily in the large case market sales in our individual disability  recently issued line of business which are primarily concentrated in the multilife market were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower sales growth from existing customers we continue to believe that the group core market and voluntary benefits market which combined together were approximately 73 percent of our unum us sales for 2013 represent significant growth opportunities we will continue to seek disciplined and opportunistic growth in the group large case and individual disability markets while in the short term we expect economic trends premium rate increases for certain of our group products and the market distraction which we believe has resulted from the implementation of healthcare reform will continue to pressure our sales growth we believe we are well positioned to expand existing relationships and leverage our brand and market leadershipyear ended december 31 2012 compared with year ended december 31 2011unum us sales were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 with growth in each of our product lines and in each of our major market segments sales in our group core market segment were higher in 2012 relative to 2011 with increases in each of the product lines within this market segment the number of new accounts added in our group core market segment during 2012 was 19 percent higher than the number of new accounts added during 2011  59sales in our group large case market segment were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 with increases in each of the product lines within this market segment we continued our disciplined and opportunistic approach to sales growth in the large case market during 2012 and although the level of sales in this market segment was higher than in 2011 our new business pricing was within our guidelines our sales mix in 2012 was approximately 69 percent core market and 31 percent large case market generally consistent with 2011 sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to strong large case sales and increases in sales to both new and existing customers the number of new accounts added in the voluntary benefits product line was 69 percent lower in 2012 than the number of new accounts added during 2011 sales in our individual disability  recently issued line of business were 25 percent higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to higher sales to existing customerssegment outlookwe believe that premium growth particularly growth within existing customer accounts will continue to be pressured during 2014 by the weak pace of economic growth low levels of employment growth the competitive environment and the distraction caused by political instability and the implementation of healthcare reform although we expect to achieve marginal yearoveryear growth in premium income during 2014 opportunities for further premium growth are not expected to reemerge until the economy improves and employment growth accelerates our net investment income may be impacted either favorably or unfavorably by fluctuations in bond call premiums and other types of miscellaneous net investment income the low interest rate environment and the tightening of credit spreads continue to place nearterm pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields and claim reserve discount rates as a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the aging of insureds we began initiating price increases for our group disability products during 2012 and will continue with these pricing levels on new and renewal business throughout 2014 we anticipate that the 2014 benefit ratio for our group disability product line will be slightly below the level of 2013 our amortization of deferred acquisition costs may be unfavorably impacted particularly in our voluntary benefits product line by higher than expected policy terminations we believe future profit margin improvement is achievable driven primarily by our continued product mix shift expense efficiencies and consistent operating effectiveness certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the disability insurance business components of claims experience such as incidence and recovery rates may be worse than we expect disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates or lower discount rates but these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates we have previously taken steps to improve our risk profile including reducing our exposure to volatile business segments through diversification by market size product segment and industry segment claim incidence levels may fluctuate due to the normal volatility that occurs in group disability business or may be related to economic conditions we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we remain confident that our strategy of focusing on protecting consumers broadening client relationships and building collaborative partnerships will enable us to achieve our longterm financial objectives we continue to see future growth opportunity based on employee choice defined employer funding superior service and effective communication our focused offerings risk management discipline consistent benefits performance and expense management have enabled us to deliver earnings growth we believe we will reach our longterm sales and premium objectives by capturing opportunities emerging in our core group and voluntary markets to grow them at abovemarket rates despite shortterm sales pressure from healthcare reforms impact and increased competition and changing distribution dynamics in the voluntary benefits market we intend to maintain our focus on persistency of our inforce block and on increasing participation levels from existing customers our continued investments in partnerships and market expansion should enhance our ability to grow the market over the long term we believe our operational excellence and the benefits derived from investments in our technology infrastructure will improve our cost position 60unum uk segment the unum uk segment includes insurance for group longterm disability group life and

partially offset by an increase in premium income as a result of rate increases in existing customer accounts net investment income declined in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to decreases in the

consistent with 2012 with higher new account sales and an increase in core market sales offset by a decrease in sales to existing customers and a decline in sales in the large case market group life sales were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of declines in new account sales in both the core and large case markets which more than offset higher sales to existing customers the decrease in group life sales was due in part to pricing discipline and the initiation of rate increases on new business also impacting the comparability of group life sales relative to 2012 was the discontinuance of new sales of certain of our group life product lines beginning in the third quarter of 2012 supplemental sales were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to lower sales in our individual disability product line sales in unum uks group longterm disability product line were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher new account sales in both the core and large case markets partially

sales and lower sales to existing customers partially offset by higher core market sales supplemental sales were lower in 2012 compared to the 2011 due primarily to lower sales in our group critical illness and individual disability product lines  64segment outlookour primary focus during 2014 is to build key capabilities to enable us to deliver future growth our shift in business mix and focus on premium rate increases for both group longterm disability and group life is expected to continue to improve our profitability however pressure on new sales and persistency is likely to continue and the low interest rate environment is expected to dampen overall earnings growth we intend to continue with our group life reinsurance program during 2014 although we have increased our retention level for our group life products that provide lump sum benefits we expect that the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment in the uk which has continued to negatively impact unum uks premium growth may continue in the near term the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly in our group life business our nearterm actions regarding rate increases reinsurance and the discontinuance of certain product lines have reduced volatility we will continue to implement rate increases in 2014 and we believe profit margins will continue to improve although group life premium income may decline as a result of these actions and a shift in business mix during 2013 the increase to premium income from rate increases largely offset the impact of policy terminations in our group longterm disability business we remain committed to driving growth in the uk market although we continue to have a cautious outlook for growth given the current environment we anticipate returning to more normal levels of premium growth as our rate increases continue to be placed in the market and as we continue to increase sales to new and existing customers we have seen some positive results in terms of new to market sales and increased coverage in existing cases in addition we continue to focus on new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income protection expanding

continued growth in the inforce block of business as a result of sales and stable persistency net investment income increased in 2013 due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher income from bond call premiums and private equity partnership investments partially offset by a decrease in the yield on invested assets 66our reported risk results were unfavorable compared to 2012 as a result of the previously discussed reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits excluding this reserve increase the benefit ratio of 525 was consistent with the level of 2012 with favorable risk results in the life product line due to improved mortality experience offsetting less favorable risk results in the accident sickness and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines that resulted from an increased level of incurred claims commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were generally consistent in 2013 compared to the prior year the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to continued growth in the level of the deferred asset as well as an unfavorable impact from the prospective unlocking for expected future experience relative to assumptions for our interestsensitive life products the increase in other expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was commensurate with the growth in premium incomeyear ended december 31 2012 compared with year ended december 31 2011premium income increased in 2012 relative to 2011 due primarily to prior period sales growth and improved persistency net investment income was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of growth in the level of invested assets an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and a higher level of fees from mortgage loan prepayments partially offset by a decline in income from bond call premiums and a decrease in yield risk results were unfavorable in 2012 compared to 2011 for the life and cancer and critical illness product lines partially offset by favorable risk results for the accident sickness and disability product line the unfavorable risk results for the life product line in 2012 were driven by higher mortality rates which can exhibit volatility from period to period risk results for the cancer and critical illness product line were slightly unfavorable in 2012 due primarily to a higher level of paid claims in the cancer product line and a higher active life reserve change due to favorable persistency for certain issue years the slightly favorable risk results in the accident sickness and disability product line in 2012 were due to favorable claim experience in the disability product commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were both higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in costs related to growth in new business premium  the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to an increase in the level of the

sales3676 16 3619 11 3659 67colonial lifes sales for 2013 were slightly higher than 2012 with growth in existing account sales in all market segments this growth was partially offset by a slight decrease in new account sales with the decline primarily occurring in the core market segment although large case commercial market sales were significantly higher than 2012 our new business pricing was within our guidelines as we continued our disciplined yet opportunistic approach to sales growth in this market we believe the 2013 decrease in core commercial market sales particularly in the small employer segment may be partially attributable to healthcare reform as well as the uncertain economic and political environment the number of new accounts decreased 182 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 while the average new case size increased 200 percentcolonial lifes sales were lower in 2012 relative to 2011 with a decrease in new account sales partially offset by an increase in existing account sales commercial market sales in 2012 were lower than 2011 with a decline in large case commercial market sales which was only partially offset by a slight increase in core commercial market sales sales also declined in the public sector market in 2012 compared to 2011 the number of new accounts decreased 50 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 while the average new case size was 42 percent lowersegment outlookcurrent economic conditions continue to affect employment growth and buying conditions which in turn impact sales and premium growth we believe proper execution of our growth strategy and a gradual improvement in the economy will deliver sales and premium growth that are in line with longterm expectations we see the continuing us economic conditions and the increasing competition in the voluntary market as external risks to achievement of our business plans we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we expect our sales momentum to improve during 2014 relative to the growth rate for 2013 further contributing to premium growth volatility in net investment income is likely to continue during 2014 as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income regarding risk results periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on colonial life due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration indemnity benefits we expect our overall benefit ratio for 2014 to be generally consistent with the level of 2013 excluding the reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits and we believe our strong profit margins will continue we believe our success will be driven primarily by execution in the core commercial and public sector segments and through expansion of the overall market as well as further geographic expansion of our market within the united states the market environment continues to shift at a rapid pace and we believe our products capabilities and service offerings will enable us to succeed in this marketplace we intend to continue to focus on operational excellence through a strong continuous improvement culture risk management practices focus on talent development and crossbusiness collaboration closed block segmentthe closed block segment consists of individual disability group and individual longterm care and other insurance products no longer actively marketed the individual disability line of business in this segment generally consists of policies we sold

ended december 31 2012total premium income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to expected policy terminations and maturities the premium decrease resulting from persistency trends in the longterm care line of business was partially offset by the favorable impact of premium rate increases on certain policies as well as the issuance of group longterm care certificates on inforce cases we continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group longterm care policies the rate increases reflect current interest rates and claim experience higher expected future claims persistency and other factors related to pricing longterm care coverage in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs net investment income was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher invested asset levels partially offset by a decrease in the yield on invested assets other income which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 due in part to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies individual disability risk results for 2013 were slightly favorable compared to 2012 due primarily to lower claim incidence rates longterm care risk results were slightly favorable in 2013 compared to 2012 due to more favorable development in active life reserves interest and debt expense in 2013 was lower than 2012 due to principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings llc northwind holdings and a decrease in the floating rate of interest the other expense ratio was consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 year ended december 31 2012 compared with year ended december 31 2011total premium income decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 with lower individual disability premium income partially offset by higher longterm care premium income the decrease in individual disability premium income was due to the runoff of this closed line of business driven by expected policy terminations and maturities the increase in longterm care premium income was due to issuances of group longterm care policies and the implementation of rate increases on certain of our individual longterm care policies although we announced in the first quarter of 2012 that we would no longer sell group longterm care we had group cases which were already in the quoting andor underwriting process at the time of our announcement and for which we subsequently issued the policies net investment income was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher asset levels higher bond call premiums and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities and other fees partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets other income which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies  individual disability risk results for 2012 were favorable compared to 2011 due to the previously discussed 2011 reserve charge excluding this charge individual disability risk results were favorable compared to 2011 due to higher claim recovery rates and a decrease in reserves for existing claims longterm care risk results were favorable in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to the 2011 reserve charge excluding this charge risk results were unfavorable compared to 2011 due to higher claim incidence rates partially offset by higher claim resolutionsinterest and debt expense in 2012 was generally consistent with 2011 as principal repayments on the amount of outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings were offset by an increase in the floating rate of interest on this debt  we had no amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2012 due to the longterm care impairment charge recognized at december 31 2011 the other expense ratio was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to a decrease in selling and underwriting costs due to our discontinuance of the sale of group longterm care in 2012 and our continued focus on operating effectiveness and expense management   70segment outlookoperating revenue and income for this segment will continue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down although we do expect additional premium income associated with longterm care rate increases we also expect a small amount of group longterm care certificates to continue to be issued where we are required to do so under the terms of existing group policies we expect that this segment may experience volatility in net investment income due to the volatility of bond call premiums relative to historical levels during 2014 we intend to continue our focus on operational effectiveness rate increases and capital management we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly profitability of our longtailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity investment returns and persistency we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for the individual disability and longterm care lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term but these product lines may experience quarterly volatility particularly in the near term for our longterm care product lines as our claim block matures claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period it is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions including but not limited to interest rates mortality morbidity and persistency could result in a material impact on our reserve levels including adjustments to reserves previously established under loss recognition 71corporate segmentthe corporate segment includes

credit partnerships and lower shortterm interest rates the negative impact on net investment income and operating income attributable to tax credit partnerships is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments other income was higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to 40 million of income recognized in 2013 related to a settlement of our appeal to the irs for tax years 2005 to 2006interest and other expenses were higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the interest expense related to the issuance of 2500 million of 575 senior notes in august 2012 and a higher level of expense accruals in 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a lower rate of interest on fixed rate debt that we have effectively converted to floating rate debt year ended december 31 2012 compared with year ended december 31 2011net investment income was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower asset levels a lower proportion of assets invested at longterm interest rates a decrease in bond call premiums and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships other income was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to 175 million of interest income recognized in 2011 related to a settlement of our appeal to the irs related to tax years 1996 to 2004interest and other expenses were lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to the maturity of 2251 million of 7625 senior notes in march 2011 a lower level of expense accruals during 2012 comparatively higher expenses in 2011 due in part to corporate initiatives and state income taxes recognized during 2011 as a result of the repatriation of uk dividends from our uk subsidiaries in 2011 partially offsetting these decreases was an impairment of a longlived fixed asset recognized during 2012 and higher interest expense due to the issuance of the 2500 million senior notes in august 2012 segment outlookwe expect the quality of our investment portfolio to remain strong the impact on net investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships is likely to continue to negatively impact net investment income for our corporate segment throughout 2014 however this is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments we are currently holding capital at our insurance subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our longterm requirements we expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through our statutory earnings while we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to risk management we believe we are well positioned with substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated each period 72investmentsoverviewour investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur we believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio including credit and interest rate management has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our resultsbelow is a summary of our formal investment policy including the overall quality and diversification objectives the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfoliosthe longterm nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns a maximum of 10 percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in belowinvestmentgrade securities 2 percent in equity securities 3 percent in tax credit partnerships 35 percent in private placements and 10 percent in commercial mortgage loans the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investmentgrade corporate securities mortgageasset backed securities bank loans government and government agencies and municipal securitieswe intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities in the aggregate the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be baa1 or higherthe maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the finance committee of unum groups board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments

discussion of our valuation of investmentsinvestment resultsnet investment income was slightly lower in 2013 relative to 2012 due primarily to a decline in the yield on invested assets partially offset by a higher level of invested assets miscellaneous net investment income which includes income from bond calls and private equity partnership investments was relatively consistent on a consolidated basis but exhibited more yearoveryear volatility on an operating segment levelnet investment income was slightly lower in 2012 relative to 2011 due primarily to a decline in yield on invested assets an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships and lower income on our unum uk inflation indexlinked bonds these declines were mostly offset by a higher level of invested assets higher bond call premiums an increase in income from private equity partnership investments and higher prepayment income on mortgagebacked securities the duration weighted book yield on the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was 628 percent as of december 31 2013 compared to a yield of 647 percent as of december 31 2012 duration is a measure of the percentage change in the fair values of assets and liabilities for a given change in interest rates cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at varying interest rate levels to obtain a range of projected cash flows under different interest rate scenariosto assess the impact of a duration mismatch which may occur under the different interest rate scenarios we measure the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change in interest rates to quantify a dollar value change although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk our determination of investment strategy relies more on longterm measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields

fixed maturity securities to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment by reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding mortgagebacked and corporate securities thereby increasing our investment yield and also improving the credit quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio the securities sold had a book value of 4089 million and generated a realized loss of 300 million 74we

companys management was replaced by a new team of executives that embarked on a radically different retailing strategy while the company had ample liquidity and sizable value in real estate assets initial operating results under this new strategy had been significantly below market expectations and there was uncertainty as to whether this new strategy would be successful because of this we had concerns that liquidity could be compromised over an extended period of time at the time of disposition these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three yearswe have an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement for which we include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the fair value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us the change in fair value of this embedded derivative during 2013 2012 and 2011 resulted primarily from a change in

insurance policy and all such securities are rated investmentgrade absent the guaranty insurance policy at december 31 2013 we held 2014 million fair value 1857 million amortized cost of perpetual debentures or hybrid securities that generally have no fixed maturity date interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrumentat december 31 2013 our mortgageassetbacked securities had an average life of 523 years effective duration of 431 years and a weighted average credit rating of aa1 the mortgageassetbacked securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services one of the risks involved in investing in mortgageassetbacked securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment incomewe have no exposure to subprime mortgages alta loans or collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolios we have not invested in mortgagebacked derivatives such as interestonly principalonly or residuals where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates the credit quality of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans the change in value of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agencybacked mortgagebacked securities as of december 31 2013 the amortized cost and fair value of our belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities was 31017 million and 31993 million respectively belowinvestmentgrade securities are inherently more risky than investmentgrade securities since the risk of default by the issuer by definition and as exhibited by bond rating is higher also the secondary market for certain belowinvestmentgrade issues can be highly illiquid additional downgrades may occur but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in belowinvestmentgrade securities nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturityour investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize nonmarket risks in our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses for each security we consider the political legal and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates the country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuers headquarters in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived we continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure we do not have foreign currency risk as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities we have no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries no unfunded commitments to issuers domiciled in these countries and have not used credit derivatives to hedge our exposure or to sell credit protection our monitoring is heightened for investments in certain countries due to our concerns over the current economic and political environments as well as the banking crisis and we believe these investments are more vulnerable to potential credit problems for those countries for which we have heightened our monitoring the following table lists our exposure by country together with a discussion on each exposure we have neither direct nor indirect exposure to sovereign debt of any other countries for which we believe there is a heightened risk of sovereign default 77european fixed maturity securities exposure  by country as of december 31 2013in millions of dollars  fair

investments during the year ended december 31 2013risk managementwhile we have no direct sovereign holdings in the aforementioned countries we have performed comprehensive stress testing and scenario analyses on all of our corporate holdings of issuers domiciled in these countries we have performed stress tests under a number of scenarios including deep recession liquidity crisis and currency redenomination with significant devaluation we continue to closely monitor this situationpotential risks for these corporate holdings include a lack of access to credit in their countries of domicile and redenomination risk as it pertains to their outstanding liabilities under either of these scenarios we believe the risk is largely mitigated because our holdings in these countries are nonfinancial and operate in defensive industries that provide essential services most are market leaders with access to diverse global capital markets current developments regarding ratings downgrades bailout packages or higher sovereign interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 78mortgage loansour mortgage loan portfolio was 18151 million and 17127 million on an amortized cost basis at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low due to conservative underwriting we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry we held one mortgage loan at december 31 2013 that was considered impaired and was carried at the estimated net realizable value of 131 million net of a valuation allowance of 15 million we held two mortgage loans at december 31 2012 which were considered impaired and were carried at the estimated net realizable value of 174 million net of a valuation allowance of 15 millionderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment duration foreign currency and credit risks historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and us treasury rates current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts forward contracts on specific fixed income securities and credit default swaps our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held was 55 million at december 31 2013 we held 11 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at december 31 2013 the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 956 million at december 31 2013 we had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at december 31 2013 we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties all of which have a median credit rating of a3 or better and by our use of crosscollateralization agreementsotherour exposure to noncurrent investments defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest andor principal payments totaled 399 million and 633 million on a fair value basis at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively  see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instrumentsliquidity and capital resourcesoverviewour liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations principally in our insurance subsidiaries premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash debt andor securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits costs of acquiring new business principally commissions operating expenses and taxes as well as purchases of new investments we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business however deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities which may negatively impact our cash flows furthermore if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries this will negatively impact statutory capital which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations as requirements of doddfrank continue to take effect in 2014 and in subsequent years to the extent that we enter into derivatives that are subject to centralized exchanges and cleared through a regulated clearinghouse we may be subject to stricter collateral requirements which could have an adverse effect on our overall liquidity  79our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations however our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent even during cycles of economic downturns which serves to minimize liquidity riskcash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately 514 million and 805 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the decline during 2013 was due primarily to repurchases of our common stock and a capital contribution of approximately 300 million related to our 2013 redomestication of unumprovident international ltd upil a captive reinsurance subsidiary from bermuda to the united states the december 31 2013 balance of which approximately 230 million was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the uk was comprised primarily of commercial paper fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of 17 years and various moneymarket funds no significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds we currently have no intent nor do we foresee a need to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries in the uk we believe we hold domestic resources sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months if we repatriate additional funds from our subsidiaries in the uk the amounts repatriated would be subject to repatriation tax effects which generally equal the difference in the us tax rate and the uk tax rateas part of our capital deployment strategy we have in recent years repurchased shares of unum groups common stock as authorized by our board of directors our current share repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in december 2013 and authorizes the repurchase of up to 750 million of common stock through june 2015 with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash alternative uses for cash and our stock price this new authorization replaced the previous authorization of 750 million that was scheduled to expire in january 2014 the dollar value of shares remaining under the current repurchase program was approximately 730 million at december 31 2013 cash available from subsidiaries unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders to pay debt obligations andor to pay expenses these payments by our insurance and noninsurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends operating and investment management fees andor interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities for life insurance companies domiciled in the us that limitation generally equals depending on the state of domicile either ten percent of an insurers statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses of the preceding year the payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to northwind reinsurance company northwind re tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re and upil all of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries captive reinsurers with unum group as the ultimate parent the captive reinsurers are all domiciled in the united states as of december 31 2013 the ability of northwind re tailwind re and upil to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by northwind re tailwind re and upil see debt contained herein in this item 7 and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of dividend restrictions for northwind reunum group andor certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our uk subsidiaries the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the uk unum limited will be impacted by new capital requirements and risk management standards under solvency ii which is to be adopted january 1 2016 solvency ii requirements have not been fully finalized but the current proposals contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers although the impact of solvency ii cannot be fully determined at this time its implementation will result in changes to the capital supervisory and disclosure requirements applicable to our uk subsidiaries the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiarys board of directors 80the ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as rbc ratios and capital adequacy andor solvency requirements funding growth objectives at an affiliate level and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings unum groups rbc ratio for its traditional us insurance subsidiaries calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula was approximately 405 percent at december 31 2013 compared to 396 percent at december 31 2012 the capital adequacy andor individual rbc ratios for each of our us insurance subsidiaries including our captive reinsurers is above the range that would require state regulatory action  during 2014 we intend to maintain a level of capital in our us and uk insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins the amount available during 2013 for the payment of ordinary dividends from unum groups traditional us insurance subsidiaries which excludes our captive reinsurers was 6237 million of which 5504 million was declared and paid the amount available during 2013 from unum limited was 1447 million of which 375 million was declared and paid to one of our uk holding companies during 2013 tailwind re and northwind re paid dividends of 124 million and 433 million to tailwind holdings and northwind holdings respectively upil paid no dividends during 2013although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends based on applicable restrictions under current law approximately 591 million is available without prior approval by regulatory authorities during 2014 for the payment of dividends from our traditional us insurance subsidiaries which excludes our captive reinsurers approximately 188 million is available for the payment of dividends from unum limited during 2014 subject to regulatory approvalinsurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from noninsurance subsidiaries except where the noninsurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum groupfunding for employee retirement benefitsin 2013 we adopted plan amendments which freeze participation and benefit accruals in our defined benefit pension plans in the us and uk effective december 31 2013 for the us plans and june 30 2014 for the uk plan because the amendments eliminate all future service accruals subsequent to the effective dates of the amendments we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations of our pension plans which decreased our net pension liability approximately 330 million with a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income less applicable income tax of approximately 115 million as of the respective dates of remeasurement concurrent with our amendments to our defined benefit pension plans we adopted amendments to increase the benefits under our defined contribution plans commensurate with the effective dates of the pension plan amendments we have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by erisa we made a voluntary contribution of 500 million to our us qualified defined benefit plan during 2013 but we do not expect to make any additional contributions during 2014 we contribute to our uk pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation we made required contributions of 25 million during 2013 and we expect to make contributions of approximately 14 million during 2014 we made contributions during 2013 of approximately 188 million and 19 million to our us and uk defined contribution plans respectively and expect to make contributions of approximately 715 million and 25 million during 2014we have estimated our future funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 and under applicable uk law considering the effects of the retirement benefit changes described herein and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial

revolving credit facility under the terms of the agreement we may request that the credit facility be increased up to 600 million borrowings under the facility are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants negative covenants and events of default that are customary the facility provides for interest rates based on either the prime rate or libor our credit facilitys financial covenants contain provisions regarding our leverage and net worth we do not anticipate any violation of those covenants however if economic conditions worsen and we incur unexpected losses we could violate certain of the financial covenants imposed by the credit facility and lose access to available funds through that facility at december 31 2013 no amount was outstanding on the facility while maintenance of the unsecured revolving credit facility provides a valuable source of contingent liquidity we believe operating cash flows are sufficient to support our shortterm liquidity needs shelf registrationwe have a shelf registration which we renewed in 2011 with the securities and exchange commission to issue various types of securities including common stock preferred stock debt securities depository shares stock purchase contracts units and warrants or preferred securities of whollyowned finance trusts the shelf registration enables us to raise funds

processing services software maintenance agreements and consulting services the aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was 283 million at december 31 2013 as part of our regular investing strategy we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date for both types of transactions we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral generally cash is received as collateral under these agreements in the event that securities are received as collateral we are not permitted to sell or repost them we also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date see transfers of financial assets as follows for further discussion to help limit the credit exposure of derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position including accrued interest receivable less collateral held was 55 million at december 31 2013 we held 11 million cash collateral from our counterparties at december 31 2013 we posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of 956 million as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2013 see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information transfers of financial assetsour investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements which increase our investment income with minimal risk we account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings we had 765 million of securities lending agreements outstanding which were collateralized by cash at december 31 2013 and were reported as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets the cash received as collateral was reinvested in shortterm investments the average balance during the year ended december 31 2013 was 1590 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 2923 million in addition at december 31 2013 we had 1329 million of offbalance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control the average balance of these offbalance sheet transactions during the year ended december 31 2013 was 670 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 1377 millionwe had no repurchase agreements outstanding at december 31 2013 the average balance during the year ended december 31 2013 was 07 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 128 million our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position the availability of longterm investments that meet our purchasing criteria and our general business needs see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information  85consolidated cash flowsoperating cash flowsnet cash provided by operating activities was 10315 million for 2013 compared to 13796 million and 11937 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income offset by payments of claims commissions expenses and income taxes premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales but on renewals and growth of existing business renewal price increases and persistency investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield the level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business the level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy as previously discussed in the operating results by segment operating cash flows also included contributions of 704 million 743 million and 203 million to our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities and change in income tax adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to 2013 and 2012 was due primarily to the 2011 charges for our longterm care and individual disability closed blocks of businessinvesting cash flows    investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments net cash used by investing activities was 399 million for 2013 compared to 11134 million and 4103 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business currently when our fixed maturity securities mature the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products when market opportunities arise as occurred during the third quarter of 2013 we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio we may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities andor rebalance our portfolio as a result sales before maturity may vary from period to period the sale and purchase of shortterm investments is influenced by our securities lending program and by the amount of cash which is at times held in shortterm investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate longterm investments andor to fund our capital deployment programsee notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further information on our investing cash flowsfinancing cash flowsfinancing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt issuance or repurchase of common stock and dividends paid to stockholders net cash used by financing activities was 9748 million in 2013 compared to 3055 million and 7204 million in 2012 and 2011 respectivelythe balance outstanding under our securities lending program decreased by 3793 million in 2013 and increased by 1435 million and 3123 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2013 we purchased and retired the outstanding principal of 625 million on our floating rate senior secured nonrecourse notes issued by tailwind holdings for 562 million and made principal payments of 600 million on our senior secured nonrecourse notes issued by northwind holdings aggregate principal payments on the tailwind holdings and northwind holdings notes were 700 million and 844 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2012 we issued 2500 million of 575 senior notes and received proceeds of 2464 million excluding the associated debt issuance costs and discounts during 2011 we made shortterm debt repayments of 2251 million at the maturity date of our senior notes due march 2011 86cash used to repurchase shares of unum groups common stock during 2013 2012 and 2011 was 3172 million 4967 million and 6199 million respectively during 2013 2012 and 2011 we paid dividends of 1465 million 1338 million and 1210 million respectively to holders of unum

disclosures about market riskwe are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below as actual results may differ see investments contained herein in item 7 and notes 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk including derivative financial instrument activity interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments derivatives and interestsensitive liabilities fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans and shortterm investments fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds securities issued by government agencies public utility bonds corporate bonds mortgagebacked securities and redeemable preferred stock all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations certain of our financial instruments fixed maturity securities and derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized gain related to these financial instruments but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities conversely a decline in interest rates may increase the net unrealized gain but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments terminate derivative positions determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge other fixed rate investments such as mortgage loans and policy loans are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances respectively rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans carrying amounts for shortterm investments approximate fair value and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investmentswe believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business we may in certain circumstances however need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs although our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk due to the long duration of our longterm care product the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes we use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments we use current and forward interest rate swaps options on forward interest rate swaps and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 89longterm debt is not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets if we modify or replace existing longterm debt instruments at current market rates we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction we believe our debtrelated risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal in the near term we expect that our need for external financing is small but changes in our business could increase our need we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december 31 2013 and 2012 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels the selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an eventthe hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december 31 2013 and 2012 are shown as follows december 31 2013in millions of dollarsnotional amount of derivativesfair valuehypothetical fv  100 bpchange in

balance sheets changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets the corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes except for changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges or derivatives not designated as hedging instruments the offset of which is reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss 902  the adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgagebacked securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgagebacked securities these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses because we actively manage our investments and liabilities actual changes could be less than those estimated above sustained periods of low interest rates may result in lower than expected profitability assuming december 31 2013 interest rates and credit spreads remained constant through 2015 our net investment income would decrease by approximately 05 million in 2014 and 65 million in 2015 relative to our current expectations this interest rate scenario does not give consideration to the effect of other factors which could impact these results such as changes in the bond market and changes in hedging strategies and positions nor does it consider the potential change to our discount rate reserve assumption and any mitigating factors such as pricing adjustments in addition a continued low interest rate environment may also result in an increase in the net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans but we do not believe it would materially affect net income in 2014 or 2015 foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in our uk operations assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the december 31 2013 and 2012 levels stockholders equity as reported in us dollars as of and for the periods then ended would have been lower by approximately 1021 million and 1095 million respectively assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the actual average exchange rates for 2013 and 2012 beforetax operating income as reported in us dollars would have decreased approximately 143 million and 126 million respectively for the years then endeddividends paid by unum limited are generally held at our uk finance subsidiary or our uk holding company if these funds are repatriated to our us holding company we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend when converted into us dollars would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries we use current and forward currency swaps to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments see consolidated operating results and unum uk segment contained herein in item 7 for further information concerning foreign currency translation  91risk management effectively taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our company to facilitate this effort we have a formal enterprise risk management erm program with a framework comprising the following key components  risk culture and governancerisk appetite policyrisk identification and prioritizationrisk and capital modelingrisk management activitiesrisk reportingour erm framework is the ongoing system of people processes and tools across our company under which we intend to function consistently and collectively to identify and assess risks and opportunities to manage all material risks within our risk

responsible for identifying measuring reporting and managing insurance and operational risks within their respective areas consistent with enterprise risk management guidance corporate risk committees and other management committees oversee the operational global technology services investment and capital management risks on a corporate level risk appetite policyour risk appetite policy describes the types of risks we are willing to take as well as the amount of enterprise risk exposure we deem acceptable in pursuit of our goals with an objective of clearly defining boundaries for our risktaking activities the starting point of our philosophy and approach to our erm strategy is our corporate strategy in contrast to many multiline peer companies we do not offer retirement savings traditional medical benefits or property and casualty insurance our corporate strategy is focused on providing group individual and voluntary benefits either as standalone products or combined with other coverages that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers we have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and believe this combination of focused expertise and experience is a competitive advantage and forms the foundation of our approach to risk management we believe our sound and consistent business practices strong internal compliance program and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently and to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business we take and manage risks to achieve our business and strategic objectives and our risk appetite statement sets boundaries for risktaking activities that link earnings capital and operational processes as well as summarizes our most material risk limits and controls we monitor our risk profile against our established risk tolerance and limits risks falling outside our risk tolerance and limits are reported to the applicable governance group where decisions are made pertaining to acceptance of the risk or implementation of remediation plans or corrective actions as deemed appropriate by that governance grouprisk identification and prioritizationrisk identification and prioritization is an ongoing process whereby we identify and assess our risk positions and exposures including notable risk events additionally we identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us knowing the potential risks we face allows us to monitor and manage their potential effects including adjusting our strategies as appropriate and holding capital levels which provide financial flexibilityrisk committees have primary responsibility for identifying and prioritizing risks within their respective areas in addition we maintain a risk ethics and compliance rec leaders program the goal of the program is to further embed rec management into our culture in a visible and effective manner this group assists with the early identification of issues timely referrals problem solving and communicationindividual employees can report material concerns and identified risks through a variety of options such as discussion with management contacting a rec leader or the erm team or utilizing the companys anonymous hotline and electronic reporting mechanismwe face a wide range of risks and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures for additional information on certain risks that may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1 and risk factors contained herein in item 1a 93risk and capital modelingwe assess material risks including how they affect us and how individual risks interrelate to provide valuable information to management in order that they may effectively manage our risks we use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess existing and emerging risks and to develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to bothwe utilize stress testing and scenario analysis for risk management and to shape our business financial and strategic planning activities both are key components of our risk appetite policy and play an important role in monitoring assessing managing and mitigating our primary risk exposures in particular stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure assess mitigating actions develop contingency plans and guide decisions around our target capital and liquidity levels for example we periodically perform stress tests on certain categories of assets or liabilities to support development of capital and liquidity risk contingency plans these tests help ensure that we have a buffer to support our operations in uncertain times and financial flexibility to respond to market opportunities stress testing is also central to reserve adequacy testing cash flow testing and asset and liability management in addition we aim to constantly improve our capital modeling techniques and methodologies that are used to determine a level of capital that is commensurate with our risk profile and to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory and rating agency requirements our capital modeling reflects appropriate aggregation of risks and diversification benefits resulting from our mix of products and business unitsour internal capital modeling and allocation aids us in making significant business decisions including

reportingregular internal and external risk reporting is an integral part of our erm framework internally erm reports are a standard part of our quarterly senior management and board meetings the reports summarize our existing and emerging risk exposures as well as report against the tolerances and limits defined by our risk appetite policy externally we are subject to a number of regulatory and rating agency risk examinations and risk reports are often included by 2015 we must comply with the orsa requirements which are intended to become a regular part of reviews of insurers erm programs we believe the orsa will provide strong evidence of the strengths of our erm framework measurement approaches key assumptions utilized in assessing our risks and prospective solvency

principles see note 15 intercompany transactions have been eliminated description of business we are the largest provider of group and individual disability products in the united states and the united kingdom we also provide a complementary portfolio of other insurance products including life insurance employer and employeepaid group benefits and other related services we market our products primarily to employers interested in providing benefits to their employees we have three principal operating business segments unum us unum uk and colonial life our other reporting segments are closed block and corporate see note 13 for further discussion of our operating segments use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed hereinfixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include longterm bonds and redeemable preferred stocks fixed maturity securities not bought and held for the purpose of selling in the near term but for which we do not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value changes in the fair value of availableforsale fixed maturity securities except for amounts related to otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings are reported as a component of other comprehensive income these amounts are net of income tax and valuation adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realizedinterest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount included within fixed maturity securities are mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income for fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when receivedin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate available information both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and nearterm funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income as applicable otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate  102notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedof cash flows expected to be collected discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income see notes 2 and 3 mortgage loans mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received for mortgage loans on which collection of interest income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of interest and recognize it in the period when an interest payment is received we typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower we consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan we evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis loantovalue and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining impairment if we determine that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of a mortgage loan we establish an allowance for credit loss if we expect to foreclose on the property the amount of the allowance typically equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral if we expect to retain the mortgage loan until payoff the allowance equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the expected future cash flows of the loan additions and reductions to our allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans are reported as a component of net realized investment gains and losses we do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments see note 3policy loans policy loans are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate included in policy loans are 30437 million and 29127 million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively other longterm investments other longterm investments are comprised primarily of tax credit partnerships and private equity partnershipstax credit partnerships in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal the primary sources of investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment these partnerships are accounted for using either the equity or the effective yield method depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of credit a tax indemnity agreement or another similar arrangement tax credits received from these partnerships are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of state premium taxes which are a component of other expenses or a reduction of income tax for those partnerships accounted for under the equity method the amortization of the principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of net investment income for those partnerships accounted for under the effective yield method amortization of the principal amount invested is reported as a component of income tax or other expensesour investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature the underlying investments held by these partnerships include both equity and debt securities and are accounted for using the equity or cost method depending on the level of ownership and the degree of our influence over partnership operating and financial policies for partnerships accounted for under the equity method our portion of partnership earnings is reported as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of income for those partnerships accounted for under the cost method we record income received from partnership distributions as either a component of net investment income or net realized investment gain or loss in accordance with the source of the funds distributed from the partnership see notes 2 and 3shortterm investments shortterm investments are carried at cost shortterm investments include investments maturing within one year such as corporate commercial paper and us treasury bills bank term deposits and other cash accounts and cash equivalents earning interest see note 2 103notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedcash and bank deposits cash and bank deposits include cash on hand and noninterest bearing cash and deposit accounts derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recognized as either other longterm investments or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value the accounting for a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging transaction we formally document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instruments effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness a derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risks of the hedged item hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship using qualitative and quantitative methods qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationshipchanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge including amounts measured as ineffectiveness and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period in which the termination occurs when interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged itemsto the extent it is effective changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earningsgains or losses on the termination of ineffective fair value or cash flow hedges are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedge out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of the derivative together with the payment of periodic fees if applicable are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value cash flow activity from the settlement of derivative contracts is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a component of proceeds from sales and maturities of other investmentsin our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreements see notes 2 and 4  104notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedfair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date assets or liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value when actively quoted prices are not available fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities or other observable inputs if observable inputs are not available unobservable inputs andor adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine fair value we categorize our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a threelevel hierarchy based on the significance of the inputs the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 see note 2  realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold see note 3deferred acquisition costs incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts have been deferred such costs include commissions other agency compensation certain selection and policy issue expenses and certain field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing in subsequent yearsdeferred acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income deferred acquisition costs related to interestsensitive policies are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins deviations from projections result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period during which such events occur generally the amortization periods for these policies approximate the estimated lives of the policiesfor certain products policyholders can elect to modify product benefits features rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment endorsement or rider to a contract or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract these transactions are known as internal replacement transactions internal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred internal replacement transactions principally on group contracts that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs loss recognition is performed on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as to future experience as of the date of the test insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense  105notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedgoodwill goodwill is the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the fair values of the reporting units are determined using discounted cash flow models the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings and the discount rate we set our discount rate assumption based on an expected risk adjusted cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the unamortized goodwill the carrying amount is reduced with a corresponding charge to expense property and equipment property and equipment is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation which is calculated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life the accumulated depreciation for property and equipment was 7608 million and 7050 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively value of business acquired value of business acquired represents the present value of future profits recorded in connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies the asset is amortized based upon expected future premium income for traditional insurance policies and estimated future gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins for interestsensitive insurance policies the value of business acquired which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets was 190 million and 235 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the accumulated amortization for value of business acquired was 1382 million and

million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we periodically review the carrying amount of value of business acquired using the same methods used to evaluate deferred acquisition costspolicy and contract benefits policy and contract benefits represent amounts paid and expected to be paid based on reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses for traditional life and accident and health products for interestsensitive products benefits are the amounts paid and expected to be paid on insured claims in excess of the policyholders policy fund balancesreserves for policy and contract benefits policy reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims not yet incurred policy reserves for traditional life and accident and health products are determined using the net level premium method the reserves are calculated based upon assumptions as to interest persistency morbidity and mortality that were appropriate at the date of issue interest rate assumptions are based on actual and expected net investment returns persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations morbidity and mortality assumptions are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations the assumptions vary by plan year of issue and policy duration and include a provision for adverse deviationpolicy reserves for group single premium annuities have been provided on a net single premium method the reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to interest mortality and retirement that were appropriate at the date of issue mortality assumptions are based upon industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations the assumptions vary by year of issue policy reserves for interestsensitive products are principally policyholder account valueswe perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency  106notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedclaim reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us our claim reserves relate primarily to disability policies and are calculated based on assumptions as to interest and claim resolution rates that are currently appropriate claim resolution rate assumptions are based on our actual experience the interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates after consideration for defaults and investment expenses for the assets supporting the liabilities for the various product lines unlike policy reserves for which assumptions are generally established and locked in at the time of policy issuance claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future experience change see note 6policyholders funds policyholders funds represent customer deposits plus interest credited at contract rates we control interest rate risk by investing in quality assets which have an aggregate duration that closely matches the expected duration of the liabilitiesincome tax deferred taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes have been measured using enacted statutory income tax rates and laws that are currently in effect we record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized see note 7shortterm and longterm debt debt is generally carried at the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized discount or premium shortterm debt consists of debt due within the next twelve months including that portion of debt otherwise classified as longterm and securities lending agreements collateralized by cash we account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings and the carrying amount of the related shortterm debt represents our liability to return cash collateral to the counterparty original issue discount or premium as well as debt issue costs are recognized as a component of interest expense over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding the carrying amount of longterm debt that is part of a fair value hedge program includes an adjustment to reflect the effect of the change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged net interest settlements for fair value hedges on our longterm debt are recognized as a component of interest expense see note 8treasury stock and retirement of common stock treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost

recognition traditional life and accident and health products are longduration contracts and premium income is recognized as revenue when due from policyholders if the contracts are experience rated

family medical leave products are reported as other income when services are rendered reinsurance we routinely enter into reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies to spread risk and thereby limit losses from large exposures for each of our reinsurance agreements we determine if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards if we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting  107notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies

a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity the determination of whether the transfer of a financial asset subject to a repurchase agreement is a sale is based in part on whether the entity maintains effective control over the financial asset this update removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial asset on substantially the agreed terms even in the event of default by the transferee and the related requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possess

instruments which are valued using active trades from independent pricing services for which there was current market activity in that specific debt instrument have fair values of 13292 million and 12120 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and are assigned a level 1 within the fair value hierarchy debt instruments which are valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques have fair values of 14952 million and 17568 million as of december 31 2013 and

these financial instruments are assigned a level 2 within the fair value hierarchyfair value measurements for financial instruments carried at fair valuewe report fixed maturity securities derivative financial instruments and equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available conversely financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditionsvaluation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or the current replacement costwe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort in some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities in other cases multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value we evaluate and weigh the results as appropriate considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstancesthe selection of the valuation methods to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the type of investments we hold our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs when using a pricing service we  112notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continuedobtain the vendors pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies we periodically review and approve the selection of our pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies when markets are less active brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker our internal investment management professionals which include portfolio managers and analysts monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions we also consider the nature of the quote particularly whether the quote is a binding offer if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value when relevant market data is unavailable which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty the income approach can in suitable circumstances provide a more appropriate fair value during 2013 we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2012we use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments inputs that may be used include the

spreadsrelevant reports issued by analysts and rating agencies audited financial statementsthe management of our investment portfolio includes establishing pricing policy and reviewing the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a securitys price in the event we receive a vendors market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security we may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade we also review all price changes from the prior month which fall outside a predetermined corridor the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price these adjustments may be made when in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument the market in which the financial instrument is traded counterparty credit risk credit structure concentration or liquidity additionally an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument in the event an asset is sold we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting period closest to the transaction datethe parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies rather the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions 113notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continuedfair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the liborsetting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values if net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the liborbased fair value obtained from our pricing sources we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources for purposes of valuing net counterparty risk we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions in regard to our own credit risk component we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the liborbased valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities interest rate risk and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangementcertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active marketat december 31 2013 approximately 60 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from trace pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific

based on nonbinding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs as discussed belowapproximately 760 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques these assets were classified as level 2 level 2 assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs other than prices included in level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated lifeapproximately 41 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more nonbinding broker price levels if validated by observable market data or on trace prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity when only one price is available it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate these assets for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data were classified as level 2approximately 139 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities matrix pricing market models andor internal models or were valued based on nonbinding quotes with no other observable market data these assets were classified as either level 2 or level 3 with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data level 3 is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date financial assets and liabilities categorized as level 3 are

to develop credit concerns than investmentgrade securities at december 31 2013 the unrealized losses in our belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities were generally due to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and to a lesser extent credit concerns related to specific securities for each specific security in an unrealized loss position we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded an otherthantemporary impairment will recover in valueas of december 31 2013 we held 245 individual

securities and 8 belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one yearin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate the following factorswhether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securitywhether we intend to sell the security

transfers of financial assetsto manage our cash position more efficiently we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions we generally use repurchase agreements as a

agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days we post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later specified date the fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash received our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements these agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be maintained as collateral generally cash is received as collateral under these agreements and is typically reinvested in shortterm investments in the event that securities are received as collateral we are not permitted to sell or repost themwe account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as

instrumentspurpose of derivativeswe are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities foreign currency risk and credit risk  historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and us treasury rates current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts forward contracts on specific fixed income securities and credit default swaps transactions hedging interest rate risk are primarily associated with our individual and group longterm care and individual and group disability products all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposesderivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities an interest rate swap is an agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts we use interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate longterm debtforward treasury locks are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity securities a forward treasury lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific us treasury bond at a future date at a predetermined priceoptions on us treasury rates are used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities these options give us the right but not the obligation to receive a specific interest rate for a specified period of time these options enable us to lock in a minimum investment yield to hedge the potential adverse impact of declining interest ratesderivatives designated as fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund our floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest additionally we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate longterm debt into floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interestderivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk are as followsforeign currency interest rate swaps have historically been used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification and to hedge the currency risk associated with certain of the principal and interest payments of the us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries  for hedges of fixed maturity securities we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment for hedges of debt issued we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments to the counterparty in exchange for fixed rate us dollardenominated principal and interest payments foreign currency forward contracts are used to minimize foreign currency risks a foreign currency forward is a derivative without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to exchange a specific amount of currencies at a specific exchange rate on a specific date we have used these forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the principal repayments of the us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries and to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for diversification purposes  130notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 4  derivative financial instruments  continuedderivatives not designated as hedging instruments and used to reduce our exposure to credit losses on securities owned are as follows credit default swaps are used as economic hedges against credit risk but do not qualify for hedge accounting a credit default swap is an agreement in which we agree with another party to pay at specified intervals a fixedrate fee in exchange for insurance against a credit event on a specific investment if a defined credit event occurs our counterparty may either pay us a net cash settlement or we may surrender the specific investment to them in exchange for cash equal to the full notional amount of the swap credit events typically include events such as bankruptcy failure to pay or certain types of debt restructuring derivative risksthe basic types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market primarily the change in interest and exchange rates and credit risk that the counterparty will not perform according to the terms of the contract the market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position including accrued interest receivable less collateral held was 55 million at december 31 2013 we held 11 million cash collateral from our counterparties at december 31 2013 we held no cash collateral at december 31 2012 we post either fixed maturity securities or cash as

we had no cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2013 we had 18 million cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2012 see note 3 for further discussion of our master netting agreements the majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings should our ratings fall below these specified levels we would be in violation of the provisions and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a liability position was 1356 million and 1705 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 131notes

years  all other incurred for the years shown in the preceding chart includes the reserve adjustments as discussed in the following paragraphs which create variances year over year excluding those adjustments the variability exhibited year over year is caused primarily by the level of claim resolutions in the period relative to the longterm expectations reflected in the reserves our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period both favorably and unfavorably claim resolution rates for 2013 in the unum us group longterm disability product line were less favorable than the level of 2012 though still above the level of our longterm assumptions2013 unclaimed death benefits reserve increasebeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established 955 million of additional claim reserves for payment of these benefits claim reserves were increased 491 million for unum us group life 263 million for unum us voluntary life and 201 million for colonial life voluntary life the reserves established were attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart 137notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 6  liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  continued2013 group life waiver of premium benefit reserve reductionwithin our unum us segment we offer group life insurance coverage which consists primarily of renewable term life insurance and includes a provision for waiver of premium if disabled the group life waiver of premium benefit group life waiver provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insured or the employer on behalf of the insured is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to a disability the group life waiver claim reserve is the present value of future anticipated death benefits reflecting the probability of death while remaining disabled claim reserves are calculated using assumptions based on past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience and are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations the two fundamental assumptions in the development of the group life waiver reserve are mortality and recovery our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry indicate an increase in life expectancies which decreases the ultimate anticipated death benefits to be paid under the group life waiver benefit emerging experience also reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates which also lessens the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insured is disabled during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions for our unum us group life waiver reserves and as a result reduced claim reserves by 850 million of this amount approximately 780 million was attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart2011 longterm care loss recognitionwe generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year but more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation included in our analysis for the longterm care product line during the fourth quarter of 2011 was a review of our reserve discount rate mortality and morbidity assumptions our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in longterm interest rates which occurred late in 2011 we also considered an updated industry study for longterm care experience which was made available midyear 2011 from the society of actuaries our analysis of this study which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience based on our analysis as of december 31 2011 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates we also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience while our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2011 we determined that deferred acquisition costs of 1960 million were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by 5736 million to reflect our then current estimate of future benefit obligations of this amount 2481 million was related to claim reserves and approximately 2150 million was attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart  138notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 6  liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  continued2011 claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block businessin december 2011 we analyzed our reserve assumptions for individual disability closed block claim reserves claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business at that time we were able with a higher degree of confidence to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data had become credible there is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered these benefits were offered during the 1980s and 1990s recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base emerging experience indicated a longer life expectancy for our older age longer duration disabled claimants which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits as a result of this experience as of december 31 2011 we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and as a result increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by 1835 million of this amount approximately 1760 million was attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart reconciliationa reconciliation of policy and

the us defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on december 31 2013 and the uk plan was closed to new entrants on december 31 2002amendments to us pension plansin 2013 we adopted plan amendments which freeze participation and benefit accruals in our us qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans effective december 31 2013 because the amendments eliminate all future service accruals subsequent to december 31 2013 for active participants in these plans we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations during 2013 the discount rate assumption increased from 450 percent at december 31 2012 to 500 percent at the remeasurement date reflecting the change in market interest rates during that period the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 750 percent remained unchanged from december 31 2012 the remeasurement resulted in a decrease in our net pension liability of 3274 million at the remeasurement date with a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income less applicable income tax of 1146 million the decrease in the net pension liability resulted primarily from the curtailment of benefits under the plan amendments as well as the increase in the discount rate assumption used to remeasure the benefit obligations as a result of these plan amendments we recognized a beforetax curtailment loss of 07 million in earnings during 2013 with a corresponding reduction in the prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive income and associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered  145notes to

reduce the maximum rate of inflation indexation was effective september 12 2013 and the amendment to freeze participation will become effective june 30 2014 although all future service accruals will be eliminated for active participants pension payments to participants currently employed will be based on the higher of i pensionable earnings at a participants retirement age or the date a participants employment ceases subject to the inflation indexation provisions in the plan or ii pensionable earnings as of june 30 2014 also subject to the inflation indexation provisions because the

rate of return on plan assets changed from 620 percent at december 31 2012 to 635 percent at the remeasurement date the remeasurement resulted in a 23 million or 15 million increase in our net pension asset at the remeasurement date as a result of these plan amendments we recognized a beforetax curtailment gain of 37 million or 23 million in earnings during 2013 with a corresponding decrease in the prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive income and associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered the majority of the prior service credit was related to the amendment to reduce the rate of inflation indexation amendments to opeb planwe discontinued offering retiree life insurance to future retirees effective december 31 2012 but continue to provide this benefit to employees who retired prior to that date as a result of this plan amendment we recognized a curtailment gain of 42 million and a prior service credit of 50 million in accumulated other comprehensive income during 2012amortization period of actuarial gain or lossbecause all participants in the us and uk pension plans are considered inactive as a result of these amendments we are required to amortize the net actuarial loss for these plans over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants the net actuarial loss was previously amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants or approximately 11 years for both us and uk participants up to the dates of remeasurement  as of december 31 2013 the estimate of the average remaining life

on plan assets assumption is an estimate based on statistical analysis of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the plan assets until current benefits are paid the marketrelated value equals the fair value of assets determined as of the measurement date our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories were based on a combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists 153notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 9

of returns and the correlation of returns between various asset classes the expected return for the total portfolio was calculated based on the plans strategic asset allocation investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the expected return assumption for the life insurance reserve for our opeb plan at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 575 percent which was based on full investment in fixed income securities with an average book yield of 558 percent and 577 percent in 2013 and 2012 respectivelyour rate of compensation increase assumption is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trendsfor measurement purposes at december 31 2013 and 2012 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year was 750 percent and 800 percent respectively for benefits payable to both retirees prior to medicare eligibility as well as medicare eligible retirees the rate was assumed to change gradually to 500 percent by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter the medical and dental premium used to determine the per retiree employer subsidy are capped if the cap is not reached by the year 2015 the caps are then set equal to the year 2015 premium certain of the current retirees and all future retirees are subject to the cap net

continuedour opeb plan currently receives a subsidy from the federal government under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the medicare act this act allows an employer to choose whether to coordinate prescription drug benefits under a retiree medical plan with the medicare prescription drug benefit or to keep the company plan design as it is and receive a subsidy from the federal government when the medicare act became effective in 2006 we initially elected to receive the subsidy from the federal government with plans to defer our coordination with the new prescription drug benefit until a later date this anticipated change was reflected in the net periodic benefit cost in 2009 we amended the plan design to stop the deferral of coordination of benefits and elected to continue receiving the existing subsidy from the federal government this election resulted in a 44 million prior service credit that began amortization in 2010 we received subsidy payments of 12 million 13 million and 13 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our expected benefit payments in future years have been reduced by the amount of subsidy payments we expect

corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business we measure and analyze our segment performance using nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below we believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit planswe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue and operating

states courts with respect to requests for monetary damages including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court further some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts based on our extensive experience and that of others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of the case or the likely disposition value therefore the specific monetary relief sought is not stated unless indicated otherwise in the descriptions below reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated claims handling matters we and our insurance subsidiaries in the ordinary course of our business are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our consolidated financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could from time to time have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period depending on the results of operations for the particular period from time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated since each insurance claim is evaluated based on its own merits there is rarely a single act or series of actions which can properly be addressed by a class action nevertheless we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are made 166notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 14  commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedmiscellaneous matters     in september 2008 we received service of a complaint in an adversary proceeding in connection with the bankruptcy case in re quebecor world usa inc et al entitled official committee of unsecured creditors of quebecor world usa inc et al v american united life insurance company et al filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the complaint alleges that we received preference payments relating to notes held by certain of our insurance subsidiaries and seeks to avoid and recover such payments plus interest and cost of the action in july 2011 the bankruptcy court ruled in our favor granting a summary judgment motion to dismiss the case against us and the other defendants this decision was affirmed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york in september 2012 and upheld by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in june 2013 in october 2013 the plaintiff filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court on february 24 2014 the supreme court denied the plaintiffs petitionin october 2010 denise merrimon bobby s mowery and all others similarly situated vs unum life insurance company of america was filed in the united states district court for the district of maine this class action alleges that we breached fiduciary duties owed to certain beneficiaries under certain group life insurance policies when we paid life insurance proceeds by establishing interestbearing retained asset accounts rather than by mailing checks plaintiffs seek to represent a class of beneficiaries under group life insurance contracts that were part of the erisa employee welfare benefit plans and under which we paid death benefits via retained asset accounts the plaintiffs principal theories in the case are 1 funds held in retained asset accounts were plan assets and the proceeds earned by us from investing those funds belonged to the beneficiaries and 2 payment of claims using retained asset accounts did not constitute payment under maines late payment statute requiring us to pay interest on the undrawn retained asset account funds at an annual rate of 18 percent in february 2012 the district court issued an opinion rejecting both of plaintiffs principal theories and ordering judgment for us at the same time however the district court held that we breached a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries by failing to pay rates comparable to the best rates available in the market for demand deposits the district court also certified a class of people who during a certain period of time were beneficiaries under certain group life insurance contracts that were part of erisa employee welfare benefit plans and were paid death benefits using retained asset accounts a bench trial was held on the issue of damages in june and july of 2013 in september 2013 the district court awarded damages based on a benchmark it created by averaging the interest rates paid on money market mutual funds and money market checking accounts based on these averages the district court found that for certain periods of the class we should have paid additional interest and awarded damages of 121 million and prejudgment interest of 13 million subsequent to this judgment in september 2013 we filed an appeal to the first circuit court of appeals and plaintiffs filed a cross appeal based on contrary law that has developed recently in similar cases we believe that we have strong legal arguments to raise on appeal we have not accrued a loss for the judgment because we have determined that we do not have a probable loss under the applicable accounting standard relating to the accrual of loss contingencies we cannot predict the timing of a decision or assure the ultimate outcome of our appealbeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established additional reserves of 955 million for payment of these benefits similar to other insurers we are undergoing an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states we are cooperating fully with this examination as well as with a delaware market conduct examination and a voluntary disclosure agreement process with the state of minnesota the legal and regulatory environment around unclaimed death benefits continues to evolve it is possible that the current examination andor similar investigations by other state jurisdictions may result in additional payments to beneficiaries the payment of abandoned funds under state law andor administrative penalties the total of which may be in excess of the reserves established see note 6 for further information concerning the reserve for unclaimed death benefits 167notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 14  commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedin december 2012 state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v provident life and accident insurance company and state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v colonial life amp accident insurance company were filed in the circuit court of putnam county west virginia these two separate complaints alleged violations of the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act by failing to identify and report all unclaimed insurance policy proceeds due to be escheated to west virginia the complaints sought to examine company records and assess penalties and costs in an undetermined amount in december 2013 the court dismissed both complaints holding that the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act does not require insurance companies to periodically search the social security administrations death master file or escheat unclaimed life insurance benefits until a claim has been submitted in january 2014 the plaintiff appealed the dismissal of both complaintsin may 2013 a purported class action complaint entitled ruben don v unum life insurance company of america wedner insurance group inc dba the morton wedner insurance agency and does 130 was filed in the superior court of california county of los angeles the plaintiff seeks to represent a class of california insureds who were issued longterm care policies containing an inflation protection feature the plaintiff alleges we incorrectly administer the inflation protection feature resulting in an underpayment of benefits the complaint makes allegations against us for breach of contract bad faith fraud violation of business and professions code 17200 and injunctive relief in june 2013 we removed the case to the united states district court for the central district of california we are in the process of preparing our response to this complaintsummaryvarious lawsuits against us in addition to those discussed above have arisen in the normal course of business further state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulationsgiven the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses except if noted in connection with specific matters it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending in part on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period we believe however that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification should not have a material adverse effect on our financial positionnote 15  statutory financial

that are generally consistent with current naic statutory accounting principles for its insurance reserves and invested assets supporting reserves all other assets and liabilities are accounted for in
