reinsurance to other insurance companies in a reinsurance transaction a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium we undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management if the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations we remain contingently liable in the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure we may also require assets to be held in trust letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers although we have controls to minimize our exposure the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsin general the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by our us insurance subsidiaries under group or individual life or group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policies during 2015 was 750 thousand per covered life per policy the retention amount has been increased to 1 million for 2016 for unum limited life insurance risk

percent of unum us group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our us insurance subsidiaries  these reinsurance agreements for unum us group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory accounting principles but do not meet insurance risk transfer in accordance with applicable us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and therefore are not accounted for as reinsurance in our consolidated gaap financial statementscertain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to northwind reinsurance company northwind re and fairwind insurance company fairwind both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries captive reinsurers domiciled in the united states with unum group as the ultimate parent these captive reinsurers were established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency during 2015 tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary established for the same purpose and domiciled in the united states merged with unum america with unum america remaining as the surviving company following the merger the

notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8  10reserves for policy and contract benefitsthe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report as liabilities policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies these reserves are the amounts which with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables interest rates and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries these differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods the assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable if actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions additional reserves may be required the key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates claim resolution rates mortality and morbidity rates policy persistency interest rates premium rate increases and any applicable policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred as we believe appropriatethe consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits the change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses deaths and benefit payments if policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits for further

of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 investments investment activities are an integral part of our business and profitability is significantly affected by investment results we segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines generally our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses we seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner subject to constraints of quality liquidity diversification and regulatory considerations our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk we may redistribute investments among our different lines of business when necessary to adjust the cash flow andor duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk our determination of investment strategy relies on longterm measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the reserves we also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and  11the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1a

subsidiary and reflect each rating agencys view of the overall financial strength capital levels earnings growth investments business mix operating performance and market position of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis rating agencies assign an outlook statement of positive negative or developing to indicate an intermediateterm trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change positive means that a rating may be raised negative means that a rating may be lowered and developing means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability alternatively a rating may have a stable outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change credit watch or under review highlights the potential direction of a shortterm or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency events that may trigger this action include mergers acquisitions recapitalizations regulatory actions criteria changes or operating developments ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level this status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list

ratings see also further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1acompetition there is significant competition among insurance companies for the types of products we sell we are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and nontraditional competitors with changes in product offerings enrollment approaches and technology solutions we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength ratings and claimspaying ratings in the individual and group disability markets we compete in the united states with a number of major companies and regionally with other companies offering specialty products our principal competitors for our other products including group life and the product offerings sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction include the largest insurance companies in the united states some of these companies have more competitive pricing or have higher claimspaying ratings some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete in the united kingdom we compete for the individual and group products we sell with a mix of large internationally recognized providers and strong local carriers we have observed some of these providers aggressively trying to maintain or grow market share in a difficult economic environment characterized by very low interest rates and expense pressures on employers and individuals we believe the need for the types of products we offer is significant in both the united states and the united kingdom individuals and families often live paycheck to paycheck with a considerable chance of being out of work pressure is also mounting on governments as to the sustainability of public assistance based on current penetration levels we believe there is substantial upside growth potential 12all areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market there is a risk that purchasers of employee benefits products may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us the effect of competition may as a result adversely affect the persistency of these and other products as well as our ability to sell products in the futurewe must attract and retain independent agents and brokers to actively market our products strong competition exists among insurers for agents and brokers we compete with other insurers for sales agents and brokers primarily on the basis of our product offerings financial strength support services and compensation sales of our products could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents and brokersfor further discussion refer to risk factors contained herein in item 1aregulation we and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive and comprehensive supervision and regulation both in the united states and in the united kingdom the laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change new or existing laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as a result of the financial market and economic challenges in recent years regulation and the cost of compliance with regulation has continued to increaseinsurance regulation and oversightour us insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business and by the us department of labor dol on a national basis primarily for the protection of policyholders state insurance departments in the us generally have broad powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including the power to license and examine insurance companies regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct license agents and brokers approve policy forms approve premium rates and subsequent increases thereon for certain insurance products establish reserve requirements and solvency standards place limitations on shareholder dividends prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments and regulate reinsurance transactions our us insurance subsidiaries are examined periodically by their states of domicile and by other states in which they are licensed to conduct business the domestic examinations have traditionally emphasized financial matters from the perspective of protection of policyholders but they can and have covered other subjects that an examining state may be interested in reviewing such as market conduct issues examinations in other states more typically focus on market conduct such as a review of sales practices including the content and use of advertising materials and the licensing and appointing of agents and brokers as well as underwriting claims and customer service practices and identification and handling of unclaimed property to determine compliance with state laws our us insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessments by state insurance guaranty associations to cover the proportional cost of insolvent or failed insurers the dol enforces a comprehensive federal statute which regulates claims paying fiduciary responsibilities and reporting and disclosure requirements for most employee benefit plansour uk insurance subsidiary unum limited is subject to dual regulation by the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca the pra oversees the financial health and stability of financial services firms and is responsible for the prudential regulation and daytoday supervision of insurance companies the fca seeks to protect consumers and oversees financial services products and practices including those governing insurance companies in the uk capital requirementsriskbased capital rbc standards for us life insurance companies are prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic the domiciliary states of our us insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the rbc model formula of the naic which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers the basis of the system is a riskbased formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurers business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer the life and health rbc formula is designed to measure annually i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks the formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized the formula is intended to be used as a regulatory tool only and is not intended as a means to rank insurers generally  13the naic continues with its initiative regarding assessment of the statebased solvency regulation framework to identify opportunities to respond to national and international insurance regulatory and solvency developments the topics of its assessment include capital requirements governance and risk management statutory accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance this ongoing assessment will likely result in significant changes to us insurance regulation and solvency standards including those for our us insurance subsidiaries this initiative resulted in the adoption of the naic risk management and own risk and solvency assessment orsa model act which following enactment at the state level requires insurers to provide at least annually a grouplevel perspective on the risks of the current and future business plans and the sufficiency of capital to support those risks of the states where our traditional us insurance subsidiaries are domiciled maine new york and tennessee have enacted orsa requirements and we filed our initial orsa summary report with the applicable insurance regulators in 2015the naic has adopted a valuation manual containing a principlesbased approach to life insurance company reserves although the naic targets a january 2017 effective date to begin a threeyear implementation period that would apply only for new business the principlesbased approach will not become effective unless it is enacted into law by a minimum number of state legislatures the timing and the effect of these changes are uncertain at this timethe naic has established a subgroup to study the insurance industrys use of captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk and is considering ways to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers the naic continues to study this issue and most recently adopted a proposal to subject certain captive reinsurers and special purpose vehicles to the same capital requirements as traditional insurers as the naic continues to examine the issue we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of their work although we believe it to be unlikely a potential outcome of the naic study is that companies could be prohibited from using captive reinsurers no changes in the use or regulation of captive reinsurers have been proposed by the naic and it is too early to predict the extent of any changes that might be made accordingly we expect to continue our strategy of using captive reinsurers to manage risks and enhance capital efficiency while monitoring the naics study and proposed changes in regulations see reinsurance contained herein in this item 1 for further discussionthe pra has statutory requirements including capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and minimum solvency margins to which unum limited must adhere current solvency standards require an insurance company to hold capital equal to the greater of i a formulaic calculation of capital related to liabilities or ii a riskbased assessment of capital which is company specific reflecting the insurance companys individual risk profile as of january 1 2016 solvency ii a european union directive that prescribes new capital requirements and risk management standards that are the result of a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the european insurance industry replaced the previous capital requirements for unum limited our european holding company is also subject to the solvency ii requirements relevant to insurance holding companies while its subsidiaries the unum european economic area eea group which includes unum limited are subject to group supervision under solvency ii solvency ii results in amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers including i requirements to demonstrate adequate financial resources including quantitative requirements technical provisions and calculation of solvency ii capital requirements through either an approved full or partial internal model or the european standard formula approach ii requirements to demonstrate an adequate system of governance including effective risk management underpinned by prospective risk identification and quantification and iii disclosure and regulatory reporting requirements the unum eea group received approval from the pra to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the solvency ii capital regime is implemented as a result there is no material change to capital requirements or to solvency ratios for the unum eea group unum eea group will however be subject to increased disclosure requirements in its reporting to the pra beginning in 2016the international association of insurance supervisors iais is developing a common framework comframe for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs that contemplates groupwide supervision across national boundaries including uniform standards for insurer corporate governance and enterprise risk management a framework for group capital adequacy assessment that accounts for groupwide risks and the establishment of ongoing supervisory colleges we do not qualify as an iaig under the current criteria for designating an iaig however we monitor the activities of the iais for the potential that comframe could apply to us in the future the iais has announced that it expects to develop a riskbased global insurance capital standard applicable to iaigs with implementation scheduled to begin in 2019 at this time we cannot predict what if any additional capital requirements compliance costs or other requirements this proposed standard might impose on us if adopted 14see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources contained herein in item 7 and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 insurance holding company regulationwe and our us insurance subsidiaries excluding captive reinsurers are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which currently include maine massachusetts tennessee south carolina and new york these laws generally require each insurance company that is domiciled in the state and a member of an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of that state and to furnish at least annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system including information concerning capital structure ownership management financial condition and certain intercompany transactions transactions between an insurer and affiliates in the holding company system generally must be fair and reasonable and if material require prior notice and approval by the domiciliary insurance regulatorin addition such laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their respective shareholders including our company and certain of our intermediate holding company subsidiaries see further discussion in risk factors contained herein in item 1a and liquidity and capital resources  cash available from subsidiaries contained herein in item 7there are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations in ways that could affect us and our insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted or amended model laws on holding company regulation that provide for supervision of insurers at the corporate group level the various proposals to implement group supervision include uniform standards for insurer corporate governance groupwide supervision of insurance holding companies adjustments to rbc calculations to account for groupwide risks and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies including a requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a us insurer submit to the lead state insurance regulator an annual enterprise risk report which identifies activities circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that if not remedied properly are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole the naic has adopted the corporate governance annual disclosure model act and the corporate governance annual disclosure model regulation which would require us insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices the model act and regulation must be adopted by individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective in a particular state at this time we cannot predict what if any additional compliance costs or other requirements the model act and regulation might impose on us if adoptedthe laws of most states including the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurance company or its holding company where these laws apply to us there can be no effective change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the appropriate insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval of the proposed change the usual measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to these laws is the acquisition of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company although this presumption is rebuttable consequently a person acquiring 10 percent or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its holding company without the prior approval of the insurance regulators in the states of domicile of the insurance companyies sought to be acquired or whose holding company is sought to be acquired will be in violation of these laws such a person may also be subject to one or more of the following actions i injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those shares by the applicable insurance regulators ii prohibition of voting of such shares and iii other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulators further many states insurance laws require that prior notification be given to state insurance regulators of a change in control of a nondomiciled insurance company doing business in the state these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance regulators to disapprove the change in control however they do authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our company or of any of our insurance subsidiaries may require prior notification in those states that have adopted prenotification laws these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change in control of our company including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable  15federal laws and regulations enacted in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the united states doddfrank directs various government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law many of which remain to be completed among other provisions doddfrank creates a new framework for regulation of the overthecounter derivatives markets including requiring that certain swaps be executed through a centralized exchange or regulated facility and be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse and subjecting major swap participants to capital and margin ie collateral requirements which will likely have the effect of increasing the costs of hedging generally and the credit risk posed by some counterparties we use derivative transactions to help us manage certain risks in our business new margin requirements for cleared and uncleared transactions are expected to require the posting of higher margin levels for our derivatives activities and also may narrowly restrict the range of eligible collateral which may require us to hold more of our assets in cash or cash equivalents that generate lower yields than other investments doddfrank also established a financial stability oversight council fsoc with authority to subject systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies such as us to supervision and stricter prudential regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve board including stricter requirements and limitations relating to riskbased capital leverage liquidity stress testing and credit exposure and in certain circumstances limitations on acquisitions or combinations restrictions on product offerings andor requirements to sell assets the fsoc adopted final rules for evaluating whether a nonbank financial company should be designated as systemically important we have not been designated as a systemically important financial company and based on the quantitative criteria set forth in the final rules at this time we believe it is unlikely that we will be subject to such designation in addition doddfrank established a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry other than with respect to health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the us financial system and recommending insurers potentially including us that should be designated for stricter regulation the fio released its report on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states which concluded that modernization and improvement are possible through a combination of steps by states and certain actions by the federal government the report made recommendations for enhanced uniformity and efficiency by states in the areas of insolvency and marketplace regulation and for direct federal involvement in certain areas such as for the fio to engage in supervisory colleges and also to study and report on the manner in which personal information is used

antimoney laundering laws outside of the united states contain some similar provisions additionally other federal laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and regulations issued by the office of foreign assets controls as well as the uks bribery act of 2010 have increased requirements relating to identifying customers prohibiting transactions with certain organizations

may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company including those in this document or made by us elsewhere such as in earnings release investor calls investor conference presentations or press releases see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1sustained periods of low interest rates in the longterm investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products and projecting our pension obligations which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition further declines in interest rates andor the continuance of the current level of low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products an interest or discount rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products we set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in that case the reserves may eventually be insufficient resulting in the need to increase our reserves andor increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs our expectations for the future investment returns on plan assets are based on a combination of historical market performance current market conditions and future capital market assumptions obtained from external consultants and economists the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period increases or decreases in longterm interest rates as well as equity market volatility will impact the fair value of our plan assets and may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans andor increased pension costs which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity

accounting principles do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions there can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances future loss development may require reserves to be increased which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods life expectancies may continue to increase which could lengthen the time a claimant receives disability or longterm care benefits and could result in a change in mortality assumptions and an increase in reserves for these and other longtailed products adjustments to reserve amounts may also be required in the event of

regulation is to protect policyholders not stockholders to that end applicable laws establish regulatory authorities including state insurance departments in the united states and the pra in the united kingdom with broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business for example our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses permits authorizations or accreditations or may be able to do so only at great cost in addition we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with or obtain appropriate exemptions from the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly reexamined existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations for example they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us restrict transactions between subsidiaries andor between us and our subsidiaries and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationsit is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate we cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted or what impact if any such proposals or if enacted such laws could have on our business results of operations or financial condition the naic or state regulators may adopt revisions to the rbc formula the pra may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins the iais may adopt capital requirements to which we could be subject or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries increased financial services regulation which could include activities undertaken by the naic and the european commission may impose greater quantitative requirements supervisory review and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies capital requirements and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries the united kingdoms financial ombudsman service which was established to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses providing financial services and the fca which has rulemaking investigative and enforcement powers to protect consumers may hamper our ability to do business which could have a material adverse effect on our uk operations programs such as healthcare reform and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace the united states social security disability insurance program may not be sustainable which may adversely affect the level of our disability claim payments and reserves 20we use affiliated captive reinsurers for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency if we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurers or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangements our ability to maintain current rbc ratios andor our capital deployment activities could be adversely affectedlegislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability changes in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes furthermore the value of deferred tax assets could be impacted by our future earnings levels changes in tax laws could also make some of our products less attractive to consumers we cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether if at all any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations doddfrank directs existing and recently created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years as a result of the regulations implemented thus far regulations directed at some derivative activities and the implementation of central clearing rules have increased the cost of some hedging activities primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements we cannot predict the requirements of the remaining regulations that will ultimately be adopted or how or whether such regulations will affect our businesses results of operations cash flows or financial condition require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings most group longterm and shortterm disability plans we administer are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa changes to erisa enacted by congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans increase the premiums associated with such plans and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitabilitythe insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates andor benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees these regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices are improper these actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operationsregulatory examinations or investigations could result in

to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionin addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditydefault riskour investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities these securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer a regulatory change pertaining to the issuers industry a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the issuer widening risk spreads ratings downgrades a change in the issuers marketplace or business prospects or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations  21our mortgage loan portfolio has default risk events or developments such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents or limit the availability of refinancing may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector a default results in the recognition of an impairment loss on the investment a default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us the probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience periods of volatility and illiquidity credit spread riskour exposure to credit spreads which is the yield above comparable us treasury securities primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads a widening of credit spreads may unfavorably impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of the investment portfolio and may adversely impact liquidity credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities valuation riskwe report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at fair value valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation particularly during periods of market disruption resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold further rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments there can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken additional impairments may need to be taken in the future and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionmarket timing and liquidity riskwhile we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business there may at times be a lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be acquired in addition we may in certain circumstances need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs there may also be a limited market for certain of our investments such as our private placement fixed maturity securities mortgage loans and policy loans which makes them more illiquid in periods of market volatility or disruption other of our securities may also experience reduced liquidity if events occur wherein we need to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or credit environment or need to quickly sell securities which are illiquid market prices may be lower than what we might realize under normal circumstances with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and notes 1 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated

of operations or financial conditionwe store confidential policyholder and employee information and other proprietary information on our information technology systems as a part of our normal business operations although we devote significant resources to maintain security systems and implement measures to protect our information technology systems and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information retained on them and to date have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity there is no assurance that these systems and measures will be sufficient to prevent physical and electronic breakins computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering we have contractual and governance safeguards in place with our thirdparty outsourcing partners and cloud computing providers to manage security as part of the service they deliver to us but these measures may not prevent attackers from exploiting weaknesses in their networks to access  22misappropriate alter or delete our data threats to our systems or those of thirdparty providers may originate externally such as from cyber criminals or other hackers or internally from within our company such as from employee error or malfeasance in some cases especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched we may be unaware of emerging threats and the magnitude of their effects or we may not become aware of an unauthorized data disclosure incident for some time after it occurs which could increase our exposure as we increase the amount of information that we retain and that we share with third parties our exposure to data security and related cybersecurity risks increasesa successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information systems could cause serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information retained on those systems harm to our reputation decreased levels of customer service or satisfaction violations of applicable privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation or enforcement proceedingswhile we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides coverage for network security privacy liability technology errors and omissions media liability first party network business interruption and electronic restoration which includes coverage for credit monitoring notification costs regulatory expense and investigative expense our insurance may not provide adequate loss coverage in all circumstancesthe failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a natural catastrophe cyber attack or other event could adversely affect our profitability results of operations or financial condition in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an epidemic a cyber attack cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure a terrorist attack or war unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data in addition in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised the failure of our information technology andor disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers operations and result in the loss theft or failure to maintain the security confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data including personal information relating to our customers such a failure could harm our reputation subject us to regulatory sanctions legal claims and increased expenses and lead to a loss of customers and revenues  competition may adversely affect our market share or profitability all of our businesses are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price quality of customer service and claims management integrated product choices financial strength and claimspaying ratings we compete for new product sales the retention of existing business and the ability to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products all of which affect our profitability we are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and nontraditional competitors with changes in product offerings enrollment approaches and technology solutions the level and intensity of competition may also grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result in larger competitors with greater financial resources there are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business and there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future see competition contained herein in item 1 for further discussionthe failure to effectively execute upgrades to or replacements of information technology systems could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionwe rely heavily on the effective operation of our information technology systems to administer our business although we believe we have information technology systems which adequately support our business needs we continually upgrade our existing information technology systems and acquire or develop new systems to keep pace with the rapidly changing business and technology environment there are risks involved with upgrading or replacing information technology systems including but not limited to data loss data errors and disruption to our operations we seek to monitor and control our exposure to the risks arising out of these activities through our risk control framework which encompasses a variety of reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms  23a decrease in our financial strength or issuer credit ratings may adversely affect our competitive position our ability to hedge our risks and our cost of capital or ability to raise capital which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquiditywe compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies a downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially among other things adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force negatively impact persistency and new sales and generally adversely affect our ability to compete a downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to unum group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital if we are downgraded significantly ratings triggers in our derivatives financial instrument contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the derivative contracts such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks see ratings contained herein in item 1 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 for further discussionevents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionthere are many events which may harm our reputation including but not limited to those discussed in this item 1a regarding regulatory investigations legal proceedings and cyber or other information security incidents in addition as an insurance company we are paid to accept certain risks those who conduct our business including executive officers and members of management sales managers investment professionals and to some extent independent agents and brokers do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk these include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities delivering effective technology solutions complying with established sales practices executing our capital management strategy exiting a line of business andor pursuing strategic growth initiatives and other decisions although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective if our employees and business associates take excessive risks andor fail to comply with internal policies and practices the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation depending on the severity of the damage to our reputation we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital andor increase our cost of capital see regulation contained herein in item 1 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on regulatory matters and legal proceedingswe provide a broad array of disability longterm care group life and voluntary insurance products that are affected by many factors and changes in any of those factors may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity disability insurancedisability insurance may be affected by a number of social economic governmental competitive and other factors changes in societal attitudes such as work ethic motivation or stability can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products both economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies the relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price underwrite and adjudicate the claims  24within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates however these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time the pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes our individual noncancelable disability policies in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium do not permit us to adjust premiums on our inforce business guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market longterm care insurancelongterm care insurance can be affected by a number of demographic medical economic governmental competitive and other factors because longterm care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is longduration in nature there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products this creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves longterm care insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but the repricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside the rate approval process can affect the length of time in which the repricing can be implemented if at all and the rate increases ultimately approved may be favorable or unfavorable relative to assumptions used to establish our reserves we monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity mortality and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves mortality continues to improve for the general population and life expectancy has increased which could lengthen the time a claimant receives longterm care benefits and may subject more policyholders to advanced aging and an associated increase in claims incidence medical advances may continue to have an impact on claim incidence and duration both favorable and unfavorable due to the long duration of the product the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities sustained periods of low or declining interest rates could result in increases in reserves and adversely affect our results of operations group life insurancegroup life insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily our risk selection process our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics the geographical concentration of employees and mortality rates claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks natural disasters and pandemic health events which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage voluntary productsvoluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect our risk selection process and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics our voluntary life insurance products generally include interest sensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate it is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate the nonlife contracts are guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products see reserves for policy and contract benefits contained herein in item 1 and executive summary and critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 for further discussion our risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk which could negatively affect our businesswe have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program which has the objective of managing our strategic market credit insurance and operations risks which ultimately impact our reputational risk however our program may not be comprehensive and our methods for monitoring and managing risk may not fully predict or mitigate future exposures see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained herein in item 7a for further information about our risk management program  25litigation and contingencies are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses andor harm to our reputation  we are and in the future may be defendants in a number of litigation matters and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive and treble damages an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated an adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may depending on the nature scope and amount of the ruling materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition encourage other litigation and limit our ability to write new business particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratingsas part of our normal operations in managing claims we are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages may from time to time have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive lossessee critical accounting estimates included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein in item 7 and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information on legal proceedingsreinsurance may not be available or affordable or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionas part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various businesses market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance reduce our results of operations accordingly we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which may adversely affect our ability to write future business result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue and increase our capital requirements the collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers we cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the effectiveness of our hedging programs may be affected by changes in the economic environment changes in interest rates capital market volatility nonperformance by our counterparties changes in the level of required collateral or regulation which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity we use derivative financial instruments to help us manage certain risks related to our business operations primarily interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities and foreign currency risk factors associated with derivative financial instruments could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or liquidity ineffectiveness of our hedges due to changes in expected future events such as the risk created by uncertainty in the economic environment or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of nonperformance by our counterparties many of which are financial institutions nonperformance by our counterparties may force us to unwind hedges and we may be unable to replace the hedge thereby leaving the risk unhedged under the terms of our hedging contracts we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral which may adversely affect our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute hedging strategies due to the increased economic cost of derivatives primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements  26changes in accounting standards may materially affect our financial statementsour financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in both the united states and the united kingdom which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the us financial accounting standards board fasb the uk accounting standards board asb and the naic accounting standards issued by the fasb and asb may be influenced by the international accounting standards board iasb these authoritative bodies have several ongoing projects regarding accounting standards that will likely be issued in the near future future accounting standards we adopt will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition currency translation could materially impact our reported operating resultsthe functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk our ability to finance our ongoing operations may not always be possible solely from internal sources of capital and liquidity if we need to seek external capital there is the risk that adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital or our cost of capitala change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations deterioration in the credit market which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner could also negatively impact our cash flows regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this item 1a may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries increase collateral requirements for certain of our derivatives transactions andor implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity without sufficient liquidity our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms or at all which may adversely affect us if our financial results are unfavorable we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the us the pra in the uk and the rating agencies that rate insurers claimspaying abilities and financial strength failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by the rating agencies need for additional capital may limit a subsidiarys ability to distribute funds to our holding companiesobtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty the markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers the availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in unum group we rely on our credit facility as a potential source of liquidity our right to borrow funds under this facility is subject to financial covenants negative covenants and events of default our ability to borrow under this facility is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders to provide funds our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facility or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments would restrict our ability to access this facility when needed with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity see liquidity and

financial conditionif our business does not perform well or as initially anticipated in our assumptions we may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment loss on intangible assets or longlived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset we have intangible assets such as deferred acquisition costs dac value of business acquired voba and goodwill dac and voba are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies recoverability testing for dac and voba is performed on an annual basis insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring servicing and measuring profitability of the contracts if recoverability testing indicates that either dac andor voba are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense goodwill is not amortized but on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors in accordance with accounting guidance we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below in addition certain events including but not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually longlived assets including assets such as real estate and information technology software also require impairment testing to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we may be unable to recover the carrying amount we assess our deferred tax assets to determine if they are realizable factors in our determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income if based on available information it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to net income charges such as accelerated amortization impairment losses or the establishment of valuation allowances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition see executive summary and critical accounting estimates included in

8671 million or 350 per diluted common share compared to net income of 4021 million or 157 per diluted common share in 2014 included in the results for both years are net realized investment gains and losses and nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses also included in our 2014 results is a reserve increase related to our longterm care block of business 6982 million before tax and 4538 million after tax or 177 per diluted common share and costs related to the early retirement of debt 132 million before tax and 104 million after tax or 004 per diluted common share adjusting for these items aftertax operating income for 2015 was 9010 million or 364 per diluted common share compared to 8991 million or 351 per diluted common share in 2014 reflecting a 37 percent growth in earnings per diluted common share our weighted average common shares outstanding assuming dilution equaled 2479 million for 2015 compared to 2567 million for 2014 reflecting our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained in this item 7 for further discussion of these items operating revenue which excludes net realized investment gains and losses increased 25 percent in 2015 relative to the prior year driven by combined premium income growth of approximately 5 percent in our principal operating business segments net investment income while a significant source of revenue for us was slightly below the level of the prior year beforetax operating income which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses as well as the 2014 longterm care reserve increase and the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt declined 10 percent compared to 2014 primarily as the result of a higher operating loss in our corporate segment and the impact on reported financial results of our uk subsidiaries from a lower foreign currency exchange rate in 2015 our unum us segment reported a slight increase in operating income of 06 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with growth in premium income and overall favorable benefits experience partially offset by lower net investment income premium income increased 64 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the benefit ratio for our unum us segment for 2015 was 701 percent compared to 706 percent in 2014 unum us sales increased 42 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 persistency for certain of our product lines is slightly below the level of the prior year but remains within our range of expectations our unum uk segment reported an increase in operating income as measured in unum uks local currency of 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with an increase in premium income and overall favorable benefits experience partially offset by lower net investment income premium income in local currency increased 23 percent in 2015 relative to 2014 the benefit ratio for unum uk was 685 percent in 2015 compared to 709 percent in 2014 unum uk sales in local currency increased 62 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 persistency remains within our range of expectations our colonial life segment reported an increase in operating income of 34 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with growth in premium income and favorable benefits experience premium income grew 51 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the 2015 benefit ratio for colonial life was 510 percent compared to 519 percent in 2014 colonial life sales increased 69 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 persistency is slightly below the level of the prior year but remains within our range of expectations our closed block segment reported a 08 percent decrease in operating income in 2015 compared to 2014 when excluding the reserve increase discussed in 2014 longterm care reserve increase contained herein with less favorable benefits experience in our longterm care line of business mostly offset by an increase in net investment income and more favorable benefits experience in our individual disability line of business benefits experience in our longterm care line of business was less favorable than in 2014 but the benefits experience of this block of business remains within our range of expectations although our profit margins continue to be pressured by the impact of the low interest rate environment on our net investment income yields our invested asset quality remains strong the net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was 37 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 63 billion at december 31 2014 with the decrease due to an increase in both us  33treasury rates and credit spreads during 2015 the earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 540 percent for 2015 compared to a yield of 552 percent for 2014 we believe our capital and financial positions are strong at december 31 2015 the rbc ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula was approximately 400 percent and generally consistent with the prior year end during 2015 we repurchased 123 million shares of unum group common stock at a cost of approximately 427 million under our share repurchase program cash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies which are a significant source of liquidity for us were approximately 475 million at december 31 20152015 acquisition of businessin september 2015 we acquired 100 percent of the common shares and voting interests in national dental plan limited and associated companies national dental for a total cash purchase price of 359 million or 543 million national dental a leading provider of dental insurance in the uk workplace is reported in our unum uk segment as part of our supplemental product line the acquisition of national dental extends our market reach broadening our employee benefit offerings in the uk this acquisition the results of which are included in our financial results and sales for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition did not have a material impact on revenue operating results or sales for 2015 see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further details on the acquisition2014 longterm care reserve increasepolicy reserves for our longterm care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and prior to the fourth quarter of 2014 were valued based on assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of the initial loss recognition gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient we undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the reviewincluded in our fourth quarter of 2014 review was an analysis of our reserve assumptions including those for the discount rate mortality and morbidity rates persistency and premium rate increases our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the continued historic low interest rate environment future market expectations and our view of future portfolio yields the assumptions we established in 2011 were set at a level that we estimated would be sustainable in a low interest rate environment for three to five years with improvements in market yields beginning after the third year since that time however interest rates continued to hover near historic lows and credit spreads tightened our assumption update for mortality incorporated the last three years of companyspecific experience and emerging trends as well as industry data where available and appropriate and reflected improvements in life expectancies beyond what was initially anticipated in 2011 our morbidity assumptions were updated to reflect trends from our own emerging company experience in claim incidence and terminations as well as trends based on available and appropriate industry data and studies our premium rate increase assumptions were updated to reflect progresstodate and our ongoing rate increase strategybased on our analysis as of december 31 2014 we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our revised expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates our revised assumptions anticipated the low interest rate environment persisting for the next three to five years with a return to more historical averages over the following five year period we updated our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant may receive longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience and we updated our projection of future premium rate increase approvals using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2014 we determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased 6982 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations this charge decreased our 2014 net income 4538 million 2014 and 2013 retirement benefit changesin 2014 we amended our us qualified defined benefit pension plan to allow a limitedtime offer of benefit payouts to eligible former employees with a vested right to a pension benefit the offer provided eligible former employees regardless of age with an option to elect to receive a lumpsum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension benefit in december 2014 or to elect receipt of monthly pension benefits commencing in january 2015 we recognized a settlement loss of 644 million before tax or 419 million after tax during the fourth quarter of 2014 this nonoperating retirementrelated loss represented the  34applicable portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss which had previously been included in accumulated other comprehensive income and which pertained to the settled benefit obligationin 2013 we adopted plan amendments which froze participation and benefit accruals in our defined benefit pension plans in the us and uk effective december 31 2013 for the us plans and june 30 2014 for the uk plan as a result of these plan amendments we recognized a net beforetax curtailment gain of 30 million during 2013 because the amendments eliminated all future service accruals subsequent to the effective dates of the amendments we were also required to remeasure the benefit obligations of our pension plans which decreased our net pension liability approximately 330 million during 2013 with a corresponding increase in other comprehensive income less applicable income tax of approximately 115 million concurrent with our amendments to our defined benefit pension plans we adopted amendments to increase the benefits under our defined contribution plans commensurate with the effective dates of the pension plan amendments2013 unclaimed death benefits reserve increasebeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis we believe adopting this process which reflects an evolving regulatory and industry practice is in the best interest of our customers therefore in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous yearsduring the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established additional reserves for payment of these benefits claim reserves were increased 491 million for unum us group life 263 million for unum us voluntary life and 201 million for colonial life voluntary life for a total reserve increase of 955 million these reserve adjustments decreased 2013 net income 621 millionalthough the legal and regulatory environment continues to evolve we believe our decision to adopt this claims practice and establish additional reserves is in the best interests of our customers2013 group life waiver of premium benefit reserve reductionwithin our unum us segment we offer group life insurance coverage which consists primarily of renewable term life insurance and includes a provision for waiver of premium if disabled the group life waiver of premium benefit group life waiver provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insured or the employer on behalf of the insured is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to a disability the group life waiver claim reserve is the present value of future anticipated death benefits reflecting the probability of death while remaining disabled claim reserves are calculated using assumptions based on past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience and are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations the two fundamental assumptions in the development of the group life waiver reserve are mortality and recovery our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry indicate an increase in life expectancies which decreases the ultimate anticipated death benefits to be paid under the group life waiver benefit emerging experience also reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates which also lessens the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insured is disabled during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions for our unum us group life waiver reserves and as a result reduced the applicable claim reserves by 850 million and increased 2013 net income 552 million consolidated company outlook for 2016we believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services we believe the need for our products and services remains strong and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk actions we continue to invest in our infrastructure and our employees with a focus on quality and simplification of processes and offerings our strategy is centered on maintaining a strong customer focus while providing an innovative product portfolio of financial protection choices to deepen employee coverages broaden employer relationships and open new markets  35our focus throughout 2016 will remain on profitably growing our business maintaining solid margins through disciplined pricing underwriting and expense management and effectively managing our capital although the low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins and could unfavorably impact the adequacy of our reserves for some products we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate this environment and allow us to maintain solid operating margins and significant financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders we have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation we believe that consistent operating results combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital will allow us to meet our longterm financial objectivesfurther discussion is included in reconciliation of nongaap financial measures consolidated operating results segment results investments and liquidity and capital resources contained in this item 7 and in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8reconciliation of nongaap financial measureswe analyze our performance using nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures of operating revenue beforetax operating income or beforetax operating loss and aftertax operating income differ from total revenue income before income tax and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below we believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses as well as the 2014 settlement loss from our pension plan amendment from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit planswe believe that excluding the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt is appropriate because in conjunction with the debt redemption we recognized in realized investment gains and losses a deferred gain from previously terminated derivatives which were associated with the hedge of this debt the amount recognized as a realized investment gain which basically offsets the cost of the debt redemption is also excluded from our nongaap financial measures since we analyze our performance excluding amounts reported as realized investment gains or losses we believe it provides investors with a more realistic view of our overall profitability if we are consistent in excluding both the cost of the debt retirement as well as the gain on the hedge of the debtwe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability  36a

make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements the accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits deferred acquisition costs valuation of investments pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes and contingent liabilities for additional information refer to our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 reserves for policy and contract benefitsreserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us reserves for policy and  37contract benefits equaled 414 billion and 413 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively or approximately 798 percent and 766 percent of our total liabilities respectively reserves ceded to reinsurers were 69 billion at both december 31 2015 and 2014 and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets  policy reserves policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums allowing a margin for expenses and profit these reserves relate primarily to our noninterest sensitive products including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment individual disability products in our unum uk segment disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment and individual disability longterm care and other products in our closed block segment the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie loss recognition occurs persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns in establishing policy reserves we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation we do not however establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptionswe perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without a provision for adverse deviation we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency thereafter the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing referred to as the gross premium valuation method wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency mortality and morbidity and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance depending on the funding mechanism a full policy reserve is held during disability reflecting continued funding of the full policy reserve during a disability claim or a fractional policy reserve is held reflecting that the individual policyholder would need to recover before he or she can again generate future claims for a separate occurrence the policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders either reach the terminal age for coverage die or voluntarily lapse the policy policy reserves for unum us unum uk and colonial life products are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap in applying this method we use as applicable by product type morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions claim resolution rate assumptions and policy persistency assumptions among others to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income we then apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive with a provision for profit allowed policy reserves for our closed block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability individual and group longterm care and certain other products all of which are no longer actively marketed the reserves for individual disability and individual and group longterm care are determined using the gross premium valuation method key assumptions are persistency mortality and morbidity claim incidence claim resolution rates commission rates and maintenance expense rates for longterm care premium rate increases are also a key assumption we apply an interest or discount rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims commissions and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive with no provision for future profit the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business under the gross premium valuation method we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient  38policy reserves for certain other products excluding individual disability and individual and group longterm care which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our closed block segment represent 58 billion on a gross basis we have ceded 47 billion of these other products policy reserves to reinsurers the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable we continue to service a block of group pension products which we have not ceded and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilitiesclaim reservesclaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and as prescribed by gaap equals our longterm best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim such as the benefits available under the applicable policy the covered benefit period the age and as appropriate the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration discount rate and policy benefit offsets including those for social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits reserves for ibnr claims similar to incurred claim reserves include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims these reserves are also established based on historical incidence rate assumptions including claim reporting patterns the average cost of claims and the expected volumes of incurred claims our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptionsclaim reserves unlike policy reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate if we believe based on our actual experience and our view of future events that our longterm assumptions need to be modified we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period incomemultiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method the paid development method the incurred loss development method the count and severity method and the expected claim cost method no single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserveswe use a tabular reserve methodology for our unum us group and individual longterm disability claims and for our closed block group and individual longterm care claims that have been reported under the tabular reserve methodology reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants such as age length of time disabled and medical diagnosis as well as assumptions regarding claim duration discount rate and policy benefit offsets we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate longterm liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim ibnr claim reserves for our longterm products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs for unum us group shortterm disability products an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted as well as on ibnr claims is determined in aggregate using a paid development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on longterm products the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our longterm liabilities and results in less estimation variability claim reserves for unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid ibnr death claims and a liability for waiver of premium benefits the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid the ibnr reserve is calculated using the paid development method and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience adjusted for unum uks own experience the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have shortterm benefits which generally have less estimation variability than our longterm products because of the shorter claim payout period our claim reserves for colonial lifes lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience the  39incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are 1 the timing rate and amount of estimated future claim payments and 2 the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims the following table displays policy reserves incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves by major product line with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable incurred claim reserves represent the expected benefits payable under each incurred claim along with other expenses associated with the payment of the claims ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products the ibnr and reopened claim reserves for our disability products

calculate reserves are 1 the discount rate 2 the claim resolution rate and 3 the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves of these assumptions our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 1the discount rate which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments in this case the reserves may eventually be insufficient we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves considering current and expected future market conditions if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield2the claim resolution rate used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves is the probability that a disability or longterm care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time claim resolution assumptions involve many factors including the cause of disability the policyholders age the type of contractual benefits provided and the time since initially becoming disabled we primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience  413the incidence rate used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured the insureds occupation or industry the benefit plan design and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors reserves particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for longterm disabilities and longterm care are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion the impact of internal and external events such as changes in claims operational procedures economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence the emergence of new diseases new trends and developments in medical treatments and legal trends and legislative changes including changes to social security and other governmentbased welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets among other factors will influence claim incidence rates claim resolution rates and claim costs in addition for policies offering coverage for disability or longterm care at advanced ages the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line additionally in any period and over time our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our longterm assumptions either singularly or collectively and these variances may offset each other we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a longterm view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption but rather in the aggregate by product line the following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions in aggregate for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for either favorable or unfavorable trends in key assumptionsgenerally we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time we have historically experienced an increase in our group longterm disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period particularly in our unum us operations during 2015 claim incidence rates for unum us group longterm disability improved slightly relative to the levels of 2014 we believe claim incidence trends for unum us group longterm disability may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general us workforceduring 2015 claim incidence rates for our closed block longterm care line of business were generally consistent with the revised assumptions we established during our 2014 reserve review and assumption update see 2014 longterm care reserve increase contained in this item 7 interest rates were slightly higher at the end of 2015 compared to the overall level of 2014 however they remain well below historical norms the assumptions we used to discount our reserves during this period were slightly lower for certain of our product lines reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims are periodically adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the longduration investment portfolios which support the reserves for the majority of our lines of businessour claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period both favorably and unfavorably claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately claim resolution rates in our unum us group and individual longterm disability product lines and our closed block individual disability product line have over the last several years exhibited some variability relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business actual quarterly rates during 2014 and 2015 have varied by 3 and 3 percent in our unum us group longterm disability line of business between 10 and 5 percent in our unum us individual disability line of business and between 4 and 4 percent in our closed block individual disability line of business during 2015 claim resolution rates pertaining to life expectancy exhibited an increase in the number of deaths although overall mortality experience in 2015 was relatively consistent with the levels of 2014 and 2013 on an annual basis for the years 2013 to 2015 our overall claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our longterm assumptions  42we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate in our estimation scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions when modeled together in aggregate could produce potential results as illustrated in the chart below the major contributor to the variance for both the unum us group longterm disability line of business and the closed block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate  potential impact positive or negative of variations in reserve assumptions on our december 31 2015 claim reserve balance in millions of dollarsunum us group longterm disability33220closed block individual disability24224in addition we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to longterm care policy reserves these reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established as of december 31 2014 the date of loss recognition assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient as such positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge policy reserves for longterm care are based upon a number of key assumptions and each assumption has various factors which may impact the longterm outcome key assumptions with respect to morbidity mortality persistency interest rates and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates for example a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate over the lifetime of our longterm care business would impact reserves by approximately 430 million assuming all other factors held constantkey assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves for example changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases andor morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health andor medical breakthroughs there is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions in the aggregate could result in a material impact on our reserve levels but we record our reserves based on our longterm best estimate because these product lines have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs either positive or negative we closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of longterm assumptions deferred acquisition costs dac we defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies deferred costs include certain commissions other agency compensation selection and policy issue expenses and field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral approximately 852 percent of our dac relates to noninterest sensitive products and we amortize dac for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies dac related to interest sensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are persistency premium income and for our interest sensitive products mortality margins and investment returns we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions for noninterest sensitive products the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy during 2015 our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2015 did not change materially from those used in 2014 generally we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the shortterm and to the extent that these trends do change we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time  43the following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years 3 10 and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred and our dac balances as of december 31 2015 and 2014    balance remaining as a  dac balances amortization of initial deferral at december 31 period year 3 year 10 year 15 2015

rate of amortization in the period such events occur as an example for our noninterest sensitive products we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our dac accounting policy fair value of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as availableforsale and are reported at fair value our derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities which are also reported at fair valuefair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the types of investments we hold the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value the market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades price quotes from third party pricing vendors price quotes we obtain from outside brokers matrix pricing discounted cash flow and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded  44issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputsinputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities including assumptions about risk for example the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value andor the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique we use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstancescertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include riskfree interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active marketas of december 31 2015 the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below where appropriate we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change riskfree interest rates of 176 percent for fiveyear maturities to 302 percent for 30year maturities were derived from the december 31 2015 yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities this compares to interest rates of 165 percent for fiveyear maturities to 275 percent for 30year maturities used at december 31 2014baa corporate bond spread adjustments ranging from 160 percent to 330 percent were added to the riskfree rate to reflect additional credit risk and the lack of liquidity we used spread adjustments ranging from 121 percent to 254 percent at december 31 2014 the changes were based on observable market spreads newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums higher than a similar interest rate spread on comparable newly issued public securitiesadditional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for foreign investments certain industries and individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater riskas of december 31 2015 approximately 68 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level 1 889 percent as level 2 and 43 percent as level 3 level 1 is the highest category of the threelevel fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs other than those included in the level 1 category that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life the level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8  45investment impairmentsone of the significant estimates related to investments is our impairment valuation in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate the following factors whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securitywhether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basiswhether the security is current as to principal and interest paymentsthe significance of the decline in valuethe time period during which there has been a significant decline in valuecurrent and future business prospects and trends of earningsthe valuation of the securitys underlying collateralrelevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cyclesmarket conditionsrating agency and governmental actionsbid and offering prices and the level of trading activityadverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investmentschanges in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet dateany other key measures for the related security we evaluate available information including the factors noted above both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we also consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and near term funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a securitywhile determining otherthantemporary impairments is a judgmental area we utilize a formal welldefined and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an otherthantemporary impairmentwe use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation mortgage loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans considering the value of the underlying collateral the value of which is periodically assessed mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 46there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilitiesthe assessment of a borrowers ability to meet its contractual obligations will change the economic outlook either domestic or foreign may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated and as such the investment may not recover in value new information may become available concerning the security such as disclosure of accounting irregularities fraud or corporate governance issues significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industrysignificant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchasedadverse rating agency actions may occursee notes 1 and 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8pension and postretirement benefit planswe sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees including nonqualified pension plans the us qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost we have a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our uk operation during 2013 our us defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants and were amended to freeze participation and benefit accruals as of december 31 2013 in 2014 we amended our us qualified defined benefit pension plan to allow a limitedtime offer of benefit payouts to eligible former employees with a vested right to a pension benefit the offer provided eligible former employees regardless of age with an option to elect to receive a lumpsum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension benefit in december 2014 or to elect receipt of monthly pension benefits commencing in january 2015 in 2015 we further amended our us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase the eligibility limit from 10000 to 100000 for a participant who terminates from the plan after december 31 2015 and elects to receive a onetime lump sum settlement of his or her entire accrued pension benefit the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants effective december 31 2002 and was amended in 2013 to freeze participation effective june 30 2014 and to reduce the maximum rate of inflation indexation from 50 percent to 25 percent for pension benefits which were earned prior to april 1997 effective at the date of adoption in 2013 the opeb plan was closed to new entrants effective december 31 2012assumptionsour net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate the longterm rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates we also use as applicable expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits which reflects a health care cost trend rate and the uk pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefitsthe assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans are reviewed annually using a december 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement the discount rate expected longterm rate of return and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments actual experience being different from our assumptions special benefits to terminated employees andor changes in benefits provided under the plans discount rate  this interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirementrelated benefit plans the rate is determined at the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our net periodic benefit cost 47longterm rate of return  this assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes generated by statistical analysis of the asset portfolio the marketrelated value as it relates to our estimate of longterm rate of return equals the fair value of plan assets determined as of the measurement date the return on plan assets recognizes all asset gains and losses including changes in fair value through the measurement date our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists and current market yields the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plans current asset holdings the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period adjusted for contributions and benefit payments a lower longterm rate of return on plan assets increases our net periodic benefit cost investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector with no undue risk concentrations in any one category see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of the investment portfolios for our plansmortality rate  this assumption reflects our best estimate as of the measurement date of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments we derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables the weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit

plan assetsduring 2015 the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan decreased 704 million or 48 percent due primarily to the payment of benefits and expenses and a negative return on assets the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan decreased 11 million or 07 percent due to payment of benefits and expenses offset partially by the return on assets although the effect of these decreases in fair value had no impact on our 2015 net periodic pension costs the less favorable rate of return on plan assets during 2015 relative to our assumed rate of return will partially offset the favorable impact on our 2016 net periodic pension costs resulting from the discount rate increase for our plans we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment  as of december 31 2015 our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of 6261 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of 79 million which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans which is 6323 million at december 31 2015 will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan which is approximately 25 years for the us plan and 34 years for the uk plan to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor as described below the decrease in the average remaining life expectancy of the  48us plan from the life expectancy of 35 years assumed in the prior year was due primarily to the 2015 plan amendment as previously discussed the unrecognized net actuarial gain of 62 million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants estimated at four years to the extent the loss is outside of the corridor the corridor for the pension and opeb plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation at december 31 2015 4234 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the us plans and 34 million was outside of the corridor for the uk plan at december 31 2015 none of the actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the opeb planthe amortization of the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and the unrecognized prior service credit is a component of our net periodic benefit cost and equaled 116 million 39 million and 279 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectivelythe fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was 14033 million at december 31 2015 compared to 14737 million at december 31 2014 the plan was in an underfunded position of 2338 million and 2451 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively this year over year change was due primarily to the decrease in period benefit obligations due to the increase in discount rate mostly offset by lower than expected asset returns the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan was 1570 million at december 31 2015 compared to 1581 million at december 31 2014 the uk pension plan was in an overfunded position of 188 million and 124 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was 112 million and 113 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively these assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan our opeb plan represents a nonvested nonguaranteed obligation and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits which are comprised of retiree life medical and dental benefits it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan see executive summary contained herein in item 7 and note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our plansincome taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years forecasted earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made likewise if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed during 2015 we recorded a valuation allowance of 13 million related to unrealized tax losses on buildings which we own and occupy in the uk we had no valuation allowance as of december 31 2014 the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions both domestic and foreign the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met  if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effectivesee note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8  49contingent liabilitieson a quarterly basis we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has

meaningful percentage         in describing our results we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures contained in this item 7 for additional discussion of these items the comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the british pound sterling to dollar exchange rate the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling in periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period in periods when the pound strengthens translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period our weighted average pounddollar exchange rate was 1528 1646 and 1566 for years ended 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively if the 2014 and 2013 results for our uk operations had been translated at the lower exchange rate of 2015 our operating revenue by segment in 2014 and 2013 would have been lower by approximately 549 million and 162 million respectively and our operating income in 2014 and 2013 would have been lower by approximately 105 million and 32 million respectively however it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency except for a limited number of transactions we do not actually convert pounds into dollars as a result we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk we continued to report year over year premium growth in each of our principal operating business segments in 2015 and in 2014 due to increased sales premium rate increases and favorable persistency in most of our product lines premium income continues to decline year over year as expected in our closed block segment net investment income declined in 2015 relative to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower income from inflation indexlinked bonds in our unum uk segment partially offset by higher levels of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income which includes income from bond call premiums mortgage fees and payoffs and partnership investments net investment income declined in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income partially offset by higher levels of invested assets  51included in net realized investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement which resulted in a realized loss of 377 million during 2015 compared to realized gains of 33 million and 307 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively we recognized 324 million of otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities in 2015 compared to losses of 135 million and 08 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively we recognized hedge gains of 359 million during 2015 associated with the maturity of debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries and 131 million during 2014 associated with the early retirement of a portion of that debt our 2013 net realized investment gain includes a 300 million loss related to the sale of lower yielding securities during a period when interest rates increased and we advantageously reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding investments see notes 4 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussionthe consolidated benefit ratio was 839 percent in 2015 compared to 938 percent in 2014 and 865 percent in 2013 excluding the 2014 and 2013 reserve adjustments the benefit ratios for 2014 and 2013 were 848 percent and 864 percent respectively the underlying benefits experience for each of our principal operating business segments is discussed more fully in segment results as follows commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs increased year over year due primarily to sales growth in our unum us and colonial life segments amortization of acquisition costs was higher year over year due primarily to growth in the level of the deferred assets in our unum us and colonial life segments and a higher level of unum us supplemental and voluntary policy terminations relative to assumptions for certain issue yearsinterest and debt expense was lower in 2015 relative to 2014 due primarily to 132 million of costs incurred in 2014 related to the early retirement of a portion of the debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries interest and debt expense for 2014 excluding the costs related to the early retirement of debt was higher than 2013 due primarily to the issuance of 350 million of 400 senior notes in the first quarter of 2014 partially offset by the second quarter of 2014 retirement of 145 million of principal outstanding on 685 debt see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our debt higher sales in certain of our product lines led to year over year increases in acquisitionrelated expenses as reported in compensation expense and in other expenses our pension amendments and the associated expenses related to those amendments also impact the comparability of expenses year over year with the previously mentioned settlement loss recorded in 2014 higher expenses in both 2015 and 2014 related to increased contributions to our defined contribution plans resulting from the 2014 pension plan amendment and a lower level of net actuarial loss amortization related to plan amendments adopted in 2013 we also continue to invest in technology and other growthrelated investments thereby increasing our level of spend related to 2013 see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans our effective income tax rate for 2015 was 300 percent compared to 258 percent in 2014 and 306 percent in 2013 our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax credits and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rate our effective tax rates for 2015 and 2013 were both favorably impacted by the enactment of income tax rate reductions by the uk government the enactments reduced the net deferred tax liability related to our uk operations by 65 million in 2015 and 63 million in 2013 our 2015 income tax also includes a reduction in federal income taxes of 68 million related to our resolution with the internal revenue service of certain outstanding issues in 2014 our us earnings included a longterm care reserve charge that resulted in a larger proportion of our 2014 earnings derived from our foreign operations and taxed at the lower rate therefore reducing our overall effective tax rate see note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further

premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported depending on the effective date of the new sale sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with gaap this is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of inforce policies written in prior years as well as current new salessales persistency of the existing block of business employment and salary growth and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income trends in new sales as well as existing market share also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new

partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets other income decreased in 2015 relative to 2014 due primarily to an expected decline in surrender fees as our interest sensitive products maturebenefits experience for the individual disability product line in 2015 was generally consistent with 2014 benefits experience for voluntary benefits in 2015 was favorable compared to 2014 due primarily to improved claim experience in our disability product line and a release of active life reserves in the critical illness product line resulting from a higher level of policy terminations relative to the prior year 58 commissions and deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to sales growth the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to growth in the level of the deferred asset and the impact of a higher level of policy terminations in 2015 relative to assumptions for certain issue years within certain product lines the growth in premium income during 2015 more than offset the growth in other expenses related to continued investment in the growth of our business resulting in a slight decline in the other expense ratio compared to 2014the individual disability product line had goodwill of 1876 million at december 31 2015 none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment year ended december 31 2014 compared with year ended december 31 2013premium income was higher in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by higher sales and stable to favorable persistency

assetsbenefits experience for the individual disability product line was slightly less favorable during 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower claim recoveries and higher claim incidence rates benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the 2013 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits excluding this reserve increase benefits experience was favorable due to improved claim experience in the disability and life product lines commissions and deferral of acquisition costs were higher in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to higher sales the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset the other expense ratio for 2014 increased compared to 2013 due to an

core market which we define as employee groups with fewer than 2000 lives and in the large case market sales for group life and accidental death and dismemberment declined during 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales to new customers partially offset by higher sales to existing customers in the core market the sales mix in the group market sector for 2015 was approximately 67 percent core market and 33 percent large case market generally consistent with the level of 2014individual disability sales which are primarily concentrated in the multilife market increased in 2015 due primarily to sales to new customers sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 with increases in both core and large case market sales year ended december 31 2014 compared with year ended december 31 2013sales of our group products increased in 2014 relative to 2013 in both the core and large case market segments for new and existing customer accounts the sales mix in the group market sector for 2014 was approximately 66 percent core market and 34 percent large case market generally consistent with the level of 2013sales in our individual disability line of business increased in 2014 due to a favorable mix of sales in the core and large case market segments sales of voluntary benefits were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 with increases in both core and large case market sales we attribute a portion of our 2014 sales growth relative to 2013 to the distraction which occurred in the marketplace during 2013 as a result of healthcare reform implementation which we believe negatively impacted our core market sales for our group and voluntary benefits products throughout 2013 segment outlookduring 2016 we expect to achieve year over year premium growth resulting from stable persistency and disciplined sales growth we believe additional improvement in our premium and sales growth rates may occur if the overall economic recovery further accelerates  our net investment income may be impacted either favorably or unfavorably by fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income the low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields and claim reserve discount rates as part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates as appropriate the implementation of premium rate increases could unfavorably impact persistency in certain of our product lines we expect our group disability benefit ratio for full year 2016 to be generally consistent with the level of 2015 our amortization of deferred acquisition costs may be unfavorably impacted particularly in our supplemental and voluntary product line by higher than expected policy terminations certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the disability insurance business components of claims experience such as incidence and recovery rates may be worse than we expect disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by among other factors the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence within the group disability market pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates or lower discount rates but these actions take time to implement and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices in addition changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates claim incidence levels may fluctuate due to the normal volatility that occurs in group disability business or may be related to economic conditions we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we remain confident in our strategy of providing consumers with valuable financial protection benefits broadening our employer client relationships and building collaborative partnerships with complementary product manufacturers technology firms and distributors our continued investment in our franchise includes active client management and a differentiated integrated experience across our product lines there are significant growth opportunities in each of our markets and within our existing client base and we continue to invest in the people processes and technologies that will allow us to enhance our ability to grow the market over the long term we believe future profit margin improvement is achievable driven primarily by our continued product mix shift expense efficiencies and consistent operating effectiveness underpinning our strategy is our continued commitment to risk management discipline talent development and our core values 60unum uk segment the unum uk segment

inforce group longterm disability product line resulting from prior year sales growth and stable persistency and in the supplemental product line resulting from the acquisition of national dentalnet investment income declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to lower income from inflation indexlinked bonds which we invest in to support the claim reserves associated with certain of our group

over year change in the reserves for future claims payments related to the inflation indexlinked group longterm disability and group life policies benefits experience was favorable in 2015 compared to 2014 due as a result of favorable experience in both the group longterm disability and group life product lines the favorable group longterm disability benefits experience was due primarily to favorable claim recoveries partially offset by unfavorable mortality experience the favorable group life experience was due to a lower claim incidence rate and a lower average claim size commissions

program as of january 1 2014 for our group life products that provide lump sum benefits partially offsetting these increases were large case policy terminations in our group life and supplemental

illness product line 64segment outlookour primary focus during 2016 remains building on the key capabilities that we believe will enable us to deliver future growth we expect to further improve our profitability through an increased focus on new to market sales our shift in business mix premium rate increases and continued pursuit of efficiency opportunities we expect the low interest rate environment to continue to contribute to a dampening of overall earnings growth and unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence lower levels of claim recoveries or lower claim discount rates as part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates as appropriate we believe the current low levels of inflation in the uk may continue to adversely impact our indexlinked net investment income with an expected corresponding reduction in the cost of benefits prior to our adoption of solvency ii a new european union capital regime that became effective january 1 2016 we received approval from the prudential regulation authority pra to use our own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the solvency ii capital regime is implemented as a result there was no material change to our capital requirements or to solvency ratios we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we remain committed to driving growth in the uk market we will continue to follow a disciplined approach to new sales activity in the competitive pricing environment we do however see genuine opportunities to grow the market in the uk through establishing new relationships with employers deepening the level of coverage with our existing corporate clients and through new offerings such as the dental product resulting from our acquisition of national dental we anticipate returning to more normal levels of premium growth as our rate increases continue to be placed in the market and as we continue to increase sales to new and existing customers we have seen some positive results in terms of new to market sales and increased coverage in existing cases we believe the outlook for higher levels of employment increases in corporate payrolls and expansion of benefit spending is beginning to improve and will positively impact our sales and operating results in addition we continue to focus on new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income protection expanding group longterm disability market penetration remains a significant opportunity and

with the level of 2015 while we expect the low interest rate environment to continue to pressure our profit margins we believe our underlying profitability will remain strong disciplined execution of our growth strategy should deliver sales and premium growth that are in line with longterm expectations unfavorable us economic conditions and the increasing competition in the voluntary market are seen as external risks to achievement of our business plans we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we believe our success will

maturities premium income for longterm care increased slightly due to rate increases and stable persistency we continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group longterm care policies the rate increases reflect current interest rates and claim experience higher expected future claims longevity persistency and other factors related to pricing longterm care coverage in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needsnet investment income was higher in 2015 relative to 2014 due to increased invested asset levels and higher miscellaneous investment income partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets other income which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of individual disability reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower investment income on those investment portfoliosindividual disability benefits experience for 2015 was favorable relative to 2014 primarily due to favorable mortality longterm care benefits experience was favorable in 2015 relative to the prior year due to the 2014 reserve increase as previously discussed excluding this reserve increase longterm care benefits experience was unfavorable compared to 2014 due to less favorable development in active life reserves as a result of higher persistencyinterest and debt expense in 2015 was lower than 2014 due to principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings llc northwind holdings the other expense ratio in 2015 was generally consistent with the same period of 2014year ended december 31 2014 compared with year ended december 31 2013total premium income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to expected policy terminations and maturities the premium decrease resulting from persistency trends in the longterm care line of business was partially offset by the favorable impact of premium rate increases on certain of these policies net investment income was higher in 2014 relative to 2013 due to increased invested asset levels and higher miscellaneous investment income partially offset by a decrease in yield on invested assets other income was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower investment income from the investment portfolios held by the ceding companies individual disability benefits experience for 2014 was unfavorable relative to 2013 due primarily to higher claim incidence rates longterm care benefits experience was unfavorable in 2014 relative to 2013 due to the 2014 reserve increase excluding this reserve increase longterm care benefits experience was favorable compared to 2013 due to lower claim incidence rates commissions decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a lower level of accrued commissions in 2014 as well as the expected runoff of these blocks of business interest and debt expense in 2014 was lower than 2013 due to principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings and a decrease in the floating rate of interest the other expense ratio was higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower premium income and an increase in expenses attributable to our longterm care product line 70segment outlookwe intend to continue our focus on operational effectiveness rate increases enhancement of our experience analysis tools and capital management we expect operating revenue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down although we anticipate additional premium income associated with longterm care rate increases we also expect a small amount of group longterm care certificates may continue to be issued where we are required to do so under the terms of existing group policies we will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly we expect the low interest rate environment to continue to place pressure on our earnings and the adequacy of our reservesprofitability of our longtailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity investment returns premium rate increases and persistency we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for the individual disability and longterm care lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term but these product lines may continue to experience quarterly volatility particularly in the near term for our longterm care product lines as our claim block matures claim resolution rates which measure the resolution of claims from recovery deaths settlements and benefit expirations are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period it is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions including but not limited to interest rates mortality morbidity premium rate increases benefit change elections and persistency could result in a material impact on the adequacy of our reserves including adjustments to reserves established under loss recognition  71corporate segmentthe corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of

compared to 2013 due to the costs related to the 2014 early retirement of debt and due to increased interest expense on debt partially offset by a higher level of retirementrelated costs allocated from corporate to our other segmentssegment outlookwe expect the low interest rate environment as well as holding lower levels of assets in this segment to continue to place pressure on investment income we are currently holding capital at our insurance subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our longterm requirements and we expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through our statutory earnings while we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to risk management we believe we are well positioned with substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated 72investmentsoverviewour investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur we believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio including credit and interest rate management has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our resultsbelow is a summary of our formal investment policy including the overall quality and diversification objectives the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfoliosthe longterm nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns a maximum of 10 percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in belowinvestmentgrade securities 2 percent in equity securities 3 percent in tax credit partnerships 35 percent in private placements and 10 percent in commercial mortgage loans the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investmentgrade corporate securities mortgageasset backed securities

103 million on fixed maturity securities issued by a large usbased coal company at the time of the impairment loss the company had a high debttoequity ratio and its projected liquidity had decreased significantly as a result of the declines in coal prices and the likelihood that prices may stay at depressed levels for an extended period of time the company has assets it can sell but liquidation

of the impairment loss the company had a high debttoequity ratio and its projected liquidity had decreased significantly as a result of the declines in oil and natural gas prices at the time of the impairment loss these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than 90 days but less than 180 days we had no individual realized investment losses of 100 million or greater from otherthantemporary impairments during 2013 and no individual realized investment losses of 100 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2015 2014 or 2013 at december 31 2015 we had minimal exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy and the securities in aggregate have a weighted average credit rating of investmentgrade absent the guaranty insurance policy at december 31 2015 we held 1425 million fair value 1293 million amortized cost of perpetual debentures or hybrid securities that generally have no fixed maturity date interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrumentat december 31 2015 our mortgageassetbacked securities had an average life of 517 years effective duration of 603 years and a weighted average credit rating of aaa the mortgageassetbacked securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services one of the risks involved in investing in mortgageassetbacked securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment incomewe have no exposure to subprime mortgages alta loans or collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolios we have not invested in mortgagebacked derivatives such as interestonly principalonly or residuals where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates the credit quality of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans the change in value of our mortgagebacked securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agencybacked mortgagebacked securitiesas of december 31 2015 the amortized cost and fair value of our belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities was 35064 million and 32981 million respectively belowinvestmentgrade securities are inherently more risky than investmentgrade securities since the risk of default by the issuer by definition and as exhibited by bond rating is higher also the secondary market for certain belowinvestmentgrade issues can be highly illiquid additional downgrades may occur but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in belowinvestmentgrade securities nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity our investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize nonmarket risks in our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses for each security we consider the political legal and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates the country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuers headquarters in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived we do not have exposure to foreign currency risk as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities we continually evaluate our foreign  77investment risk exposure our monitoring is heightened for investments in certain countries due to our concerns over the current economic and political environments and we believe these investments are more vulnerable to potential credit problems at december 31 2015 we had minimal exposure in those countries and had no direct exposure to financial institutions of those countriesfixed maturity securities  energy sectorour investment portfolio has exposure to companies whose businesses are negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices these include exploration and production companies refineries midstream and pipeline companies and oilfield service businesses the sharp drop in the price of oil is putting pressure on the earnings and cash flows of some of these businesses the degree to which a business is affected by oil and gas prices can vary greatly depending on among other things its energy subsector exposure to different types of oil and gas within a subsector geographic locations cost structure flexibility capital structure and hedging policies at december 31 2015 approximately onethird of our exposure to the energy sector was represented by the independent and oilfield subsectors where demand for products is highly correlated with oil and gas prices the remaining twothirds of our exposure to the energy sector was represented by the midstream integrated refining and other energy subsectors which tend to be more correlated to product volume sales as opposed to the commodity price the majority of our energy sector holdings are investmentgrade fixed maturity securities at december 31 2015 the fair value of investmentgrade fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was 44864 million with a gross unrealized gain of 3212 million and a gross unrealized loss of 1829 million the fair value of belowinvestmentgrade fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was 5251 million with a gross unrealized loss of 1897 millionwe perform sensitivity analysis on all energyrelated investments in our portfolios using different oil and gas price scenarios and we continue to closely monitor this situation while downgrades and impairments may occur we currently believe that the impact would not materially alter our financial position or capital plans if oil prices were to remain at the current depressed levels for a period of several years we would expect losses on these investments to increase the following table shows additional information related to

loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low due to conservative underwriting we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry we held no impaired mortgage loans at december 31 2015 we held one impaired mortgage loan at december 31 2014 that was carried at the estimated net realizable value of 131 million net of a valuation allowance of 15 million 78derivative financial instrumentswe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment duration foreign currency and credit risks historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and us treasury rates current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts forward contracts on specific fixed income securities and credit default swaps our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position including accrued interest receivable less collateral held was 85 million at december 31 2015 we held 364 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at december 31 2015 the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 273 million at december 31 2015 we had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at december 31 2015 we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties all of which have an investmentgrade credit rating and by our use of crosscollateralization agreementsotherour exposure to noncurrent investments defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest andor principal payments totaled 368 million and 404 million on a fair value basis at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively  see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instrumentsliquidity and capital resourcesoverview our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations principally in our insurance subsidiaries premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash debt andor securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits costs of acquiring new business principally commissions operating expenses and taxes as well as purchases of new investments we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business however deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities which may negatively impact our cash flows furthermore if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries this will negatively impact statutory capital which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations as requirements of doddfrank continue to take effect in 2016 and in subsequent years to the extent that we enter into derivatives that are subject to centralized exchanges and cleared through a regulated clearinghouse we may be subject to stricter collateral requirements which could have an adverse effect on our overall liquidityour policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations however our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent even during cycles of economic downturns which serves to minimize liquidity riskcash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately 475 million and 575 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the december 31 2015 balance of which approximately 168 million was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the uk was comprised primarily of commercial paper fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of 57 years and various moneymarket funds no significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds we currently have no intent nor do we foresee a need to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries in the uk we believe we hold domestic resources sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months if we repatriate additional funds from our subsidiaries in the uk the amounts repatriated would be subject to repatriation tax effects which generally equal the difference in the us tax rate and the uk tax rate 79as part of our capital deployment strategy we have in recent years repurchased shares of unum groups common stock as authorized by our board of directors our current share repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in may 2015 and authorizes the repurchase of up to 750 million of common stock through november 2016 with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash alternative uses for cash and our stock price during 2015 we repurchased 123 million shares at a cost of approximately 427 million the dollar value of shares remaining under the repurchase program was approximately 502 million at december 31 2015 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 cash available from subsidiaries unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders to pay debt obligations andor to pay expenses these payments by our insurance and noninsurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends operating and investment management fees andor interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities for life insurance companies domiciled in the us that limitation generally equals depending on the state of domicile either ten percent of an insurers statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses of the preceding year the payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to northwind reinsurance company northwind re and fairwind insurance company fairwind both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in the united states with unum group as the ultimate parent the ability of northwind re and fairwind to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by northwind re and fairwind during 2015 tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the united states merged with unum life insurance company of america unum america a domestic insurance subsidiary of unum group with unum america remaining as the surviving company following the merger the majority of the block of group longterm disability business written by unum america and previously ceded to tailwind re was ceded to an unaffiliated reinsurer unum americas capital adequacy and ability to pay dividends to unum group were not materially impacted by this transactionthe ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as rbc ratios and capital adequacy andor solvency requirements funding growth objectives at an affiliate level and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings at december 31 2015 the capital adequacy and individual rbc ratios for each of our us insurance subsidiaries including our captive reinsurers is above the range that would require state regulatory action 80unum group andor certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our uk subsidiaries the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the uk as of january 1 2016 solvency ii a european union directive that prescribes new capital requirements and risk management standards for the european insurance industry replaced the previous capital requirements for unum limited our european holding company is also subject to the solvency ii requirements relevant to insurance holding companies while its subsidiaries the unum european economic area eea group which includes unum limited are subject to group supervision under solvency ii the unum eea group received approval from the uk pra to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the solvency ii capital regime is implemented as a result there is no material change to capital requirements or to solvency ratios for the unum eea group there remains some uncertainty regarding how solvency ii may impact dividend approvalsthe payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiarys board of directorsthe amount available during 2015 for the payment of ordinary dividends from unum groups traditional us insurance subsidiaries which excludes our captive reinsurers was approximately 605 million of which 5946 million was declared and paid the amount available during 2015 from unum limited was approximately 167 million of which 300 million was declared and paid to one of our uk holding companies during 2015 northwind re paid dividends of 790 million to northwind holdings fairwind paid no dividends during 2015during 2016 we intend to maintain a level of capital in our us and uk insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends based on applicable restrictions under current law approximately 664 million is available without prior approval by regulatory authorities during 2016 for the payment of dividends from our traditional us insurance subsidiaries which excludes our captive reinsurers approximately 148 million is available for the payment of dividends from unum limited during 2016 subject to regulatory approvalinsurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from noninsurance subsidiaries except where the noninsurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum groupfunding for employee benefit planswe made contributions of 698 million and 37 million to our us and uk defined contribution plans respectively in 2015 and expect to make contributions of approximately 70 million and 4 million during 2016 we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan or our uk defined benefit pension plan during 2015 nor do we expect to make any contributions to either plan during 2016 we have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the employee retirement income security act we have estimated our future funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 and under applicable uk law and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans debtthere are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations we continually monitor our compliance with our debt covenants and remain in compliance we have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants purchases and retirement of debt in 2015 we made a debt repayment of 1519 million at the maturity date of our remaining 685 notes due november 2015 in 2014 we purchased and retired 1450 million principal of the 685 notes including a makewhole amount of 132 million for a total cost of 1582 million in 2013 we purchased and retired the outstanding principal of 625 million on the floating rate senior secured nonrecourse notes issued by tailwind holdings resulting in a beforetax gain of 40 million  81northwind holdings made principal payments on its floating rate senior secured notes of 744 million 416 million and 600 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectivelyissuance of debt in 2015 we issued 2750 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering these notes due 2025 bear interest at a fixed rate of 3875 and are payable semiannually the notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt in 2014 we issued 3500 million of unsecured senior notes in a public offering these notes due 2024 bear interest at a fixed rate of 400 and are payable semiannually the notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt credit facilityin 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 400 million unsecured revolving credit facility under the terms of the agreement we may request that the credit facility be increased up to 600 million borrowings under the credit facility are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants negative covenants and events of default that are customary the credit facility provides for borrowing at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or libor in addition the credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations at december 31 2015 letters of credit totaling 21 million had been issued from the credit facility but there was no borrowed amount outstanding our credit facilitys financial covenants contain provisions regarding our leverage and net worth we do not anticipate any violation of these covenants however if economic conditions worsen and we incur unexpected losses we could violate certain of the financial covenants imposed by the credit facility and lose access to available funds or lines of credit through the facility while maintenance of the unsecured revolving credit facility provides a valuable source of contingent liquidity we believe operating cash flows are sufficient to support our shortterm liquidity needs shelf registrationwe filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission in 2014 to issue various types of securities including common stock preferred stock debt securities depository shares stock purchase contracts units and warrants or preferred securities of whollyowned

maintenance agreements and consulting services the aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was 143 million at december 31 2015 as part of our regular investing strategy we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date for both types of transactions we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral generally cash is received as collateral under these agreements in the event that securities are received as collateral we are not permitted to sell or repost them we also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and also shortterm agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date see transfers of financial assets as follows for further discussion to help limit the credit exposure of derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position including accrued interest receivable less collateral held was 85 million at december 31 2015 we held cash collateral from our counterparties of 364 million at december 31 2015 and had posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of 273 million as collateral to our counterparties see notes 3 4 and 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for additional information transfers of financial assets our investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements which increases our investment income with minimal risk we account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings we had 290 million of securities lending agreements outstanding which were collateralized by cash at december 31 2015 and were reported as payables for collateral on investments in our consolidated balance sheets the cash received as collateral was reinvested in shortterm investments the average balance during the year ended december 31 2015 was 331 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 521 million in addition at december 31 2015 we had 1593 million of offbalance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control the average balance of these offbalance sheet transactions during the year ended december 31 2015 was 1652 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 2087 millionwe had no repurchase agreements outstanding at december 31 2015 the average balance during the year ended december 31 2015 was 14 million and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was 123 million our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position the availability of longterm investments that meet our purchasing criteria and our general business needs  84certain of our us insurance subsidiaries are members of regional fhlbs during 2015 we made initial common stock membership purchases and obtained funding advances of 3500 million for the

payments of claims commissions expenses and income taxes premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales but on policy renewals and growth of existing business renewal price increases and persistency investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield the level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business the level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy as previously discussed in the operating results by segmentthe variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2014 was due primarily to the 2014 reserve increase for our longterm care line of businessinvesting cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business when market opportunities arise we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio as was the case during 2013 when we sold lower yielding fixed maturity securities to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment by reinvesting the proceeds into higher yielding mortgagebacked and corporate securities with a higher credit quality we may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities andor rebalance our portfolio as a result sales before maturity may vary from period to period the sale and purchase of shortterm investments is influenced by our securities lending program and by the amount of cash which is at times held in shortterm investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate longterm investments andor to fund our capital deployment program our cash flows for 2015 include the proceeds received from our fhlb funding advances and the subsequent deployment of those funds to purchase fixed maturity securitiessee notes 3 4 and 13 of the notes to

including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below as actual results may differ see risk factors contained herein in item 1a investments contained herein in item 7 and notes 2 3 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item 8 for further discussion of the qualitative aspects of market risk including derivative financial instrument activity interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments derivatives and interest sensitive liabilities fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans and shortterm investments fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds securities issued by government agencies public utility bonds corporate bonds mortgagebacked securities and redeemable preferred stock all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations certain of our financial instruments fixed maturity securities and derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized gain related to these financial instruments but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities conversely a decline in interest rates may increase the net unrealized gain but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments terminate derivative positions determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge other fixed rate investments such as mortgage loans and policy loans are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances respectively rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans carrying amounts for shortterm investments approximate fair value and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investmentswe believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business we may in certain circumstances however need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements changes in tax laws rating agency decisions andor unexpected changes in liquidity needs  87although our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk due to the long duration of our longterm care product the timing andor amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes we use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments we use current and forward interest rate swaps options on forward interest rate swaps and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilitiesdebt is not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets if we modify or replace existing debt instruments at current market rates we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction we believe our debtrelated risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal in the near term we expect that our need for external financing is small but changes in our business could increase our need we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december 31 2015 and 2014 based on a hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates from year end levels the selection of a 100 basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an eventthe hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december 31 2015

balance sheets changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets the corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes except for changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges or derivatives not designated as hedging instruments the offset of which is reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss2  the adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgagebacked securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgagebacked securities these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flow analyses because we actively manage our investments and liabilities actual changes could be less than those estimated above we remain in an environment of low interest rates which continues to place pressure on our profit margins as we invest cash flows to support our businesses we estimate that we will have approximately 28 billion of investable cash flows in 2016 assuming interest rates and credit spreads remain constant throughout 2016 at the january 2016 market levels our net investment income would decrease by approximately 06 million in 2016 and 5 million in 2017 as a result of the investment of cash flows at levels below our current expectations this interest rate scenario does not give consideration to the effect of other factors which could impact these results such as changes in the bond market and changes in hedging strategies and positions nor does it consider the potential change to our discount rate reserve assumptions and any mitigating factors such as pricing adjustments in addition a continued low or declining interest rate environment may also result in an increase in the net periodic benefit costs for our pension plans but we do not believe it would materially affect net income in 2016 or 2017foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in our uk operations  89assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the december 31 2015 and 2014 levels stockholders equity as reported in us dollars would have been lower by approximately 100 million at each of those year end periods assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased 10 percent from the actual average exchange rates for 2015 and 2014 beforetax operating income as reported in us

and other management committees oversee the operational global technology services investment and capital management risks on a corporate level risk appetite policyour risk appetite policy describes the types of risks we are willing to take as well as the amount of enterprise risk exposure we deem acceptable in pursuit of our goals with an objective of clearly defining boundaries for our risktaking activities the starting point of our philosophy and approach to our erm strategy is our corporate strategy in contrast to many multiline peer companies we do not offer retirement savings traditional medical benefits or property and casualty insurance our corporate strategy is focused on providing group individual and voluntary benefits either as standalone products or combined with other coverages that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers we have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and believe this combination of focused expertise and experience is a competitive advantage and forms the foundation of our approach to risk management we believe our sound and consistent business practices strong internal compliance program and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently and to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business we take and manage risks to achieve our business and strategic objectives and our risk appetite statement sets boundaries for risktaking activities that link earnings capital and operational processes as well as summarizes our most material risk limits and controls we monitor our risk profile against our established risk tolerance and limits risks falling outside our risk tolerance and limits are reported to the applicable governance group where decisions are made pertaining to acceptance of the risk or implementation of remediation plans or corrective actions as deemed appropriate by that governance group 91risk identification and prioritizationrisk identification and prioritization is an ongoing process whereby we identify and assess our risk positions and exposures including notable risk events additionally we identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us knowing the potential risks we face allows us to monitor and manage their potential effects including adjusting our strategies as appropriate and holding capital levels which provide financial flexibility risk and other management committees have primary responsibility for identifying and prioritizing risks within their respective areas we face a wide range of risks and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures for additional information on certain risks that may adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements contained herein on page 1 and risk factors contained herein in item 1arisk and capital modelingwe assess material risks including how they affect us and how individual risks interrelate to provide valuable information to management in order that they may effectively manage our risks we use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess existing and emerging risks and to develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to bothwe utilize stress testing and scenario analysis for risk management and to shape our business financial and strategic planning activities both are key components of our risk appetite policy and play an important role in monitoring assessing managing and mitigating our primary risk exposures in particular stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure assess mitigating actions develop contingency plans and guide decisions around our target capital and liquidity levels for example we periodically perform stress tests on certain categories of assets or liabilities to support development of capital and liquidity risk contingency plans these tests help ensure that we have a buffer to support our operations in uncertain times and financial flexibility to respond to market opportunities stress testing is also central to reserve adequacy testing cash flow testing and asset and liability management in addition we aim to constantly improve our capital modeling techniques and methodologies that are used to determine a level of capital that is commensurate with our risk profile and to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory and rating agency requirements our capital modeling reflects appropriate aggregation of risks and diversification benefits resulting from our mix of products and business unitsour internal capital modeling and allocation aids us in making significant business decisions including strategic planning capital management risk limit determination reinsurance purchases hedging activities asset allocation pricing

risktaking in areas where we have established risk management skills and capabilitieswe seek to manage our exposure to insurance risk through a combination of prudent underwriting with effective risk selection maintaining pricing discipline sound reserving practices claims operational effectiveness and selective use of reinsurance detailed underwriting guidelines and claim policies are tools used

operational risk metrics that measure operating effectiveness from the customer perspective 92risk reportingregular internal and external risk reporting is an integral part of our erm framework internally erm reports are a standard part of our quarterly senior management and board meetings the reports summarize our existing and emerging risk exposures as well as report against the tolerances and limits defined by our risk appetite policy externally we are subject to a number of regulatory and rating agency risk examinations and risk reports are often included annually we file our own risk and solvency assessment summary report with the applicable insurance regulators for our us insurance subsidiaries this report provides strong evidence of the strengths of our erm framework measurement

accompanying consolidated financial statements of unum group and its subsidiaries the company have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap such accounting principles differ from statutory accounting principles see note 15 intercompany transactions have been eliminated description of business we are the largest provider of group and individual disability products in the united states and the united kingdom we also provide a complementary portfolio of other insurance products including life insurance employer and employeepaid group benefits and other related services either as standalone products or combined with other coverages we market our products primarily through the workplace we have three principal operating business segments unum us unum uk and colonial life our other reporting segments are closed block and corporate see note 13 for further discussion of our operating segments use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed hereinfixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include longterm bonds and redeemable preferred stocks our fixed maturity securities are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value changes in the fair value of availableforsale fixed maturity securities except for amounts related to otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings are reported as a component of other comprehensive income these amounts are net of income tax and valuation adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realizedinterest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount included within fixed maturity securities are mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income for fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when receivedin determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary we evaluate available information both positive and negative in reaching our conclusions in particular we consider the strength of the issuers balance sheet its debt obligations and nearterm funding requirements cash flow and liquidity the profitability of its core businesses the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment and its access to capital markets although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income as applicable otherthantemporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value otherthantemporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of  101notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedacquisition for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss through earnings if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income over the remaining life of the investment see notes 2 and 3 mortgage loans mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for probable losses interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received for mortgage loans on which collection of interest income is uncertain we discontinue the accrual of interest and recognize it in the period when an interest payment is received we typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower we consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan we evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis loantovalue and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining impairment if we determine that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of a mortgage loan we establish an allowance for credit loss if we expect to foreclose on the property the amount of the allowance typically equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral if we expect to retain the mortgage loan until payoff the allowance equals the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the expected future cash flows of the loan additions and reductions to our allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans are reported as a component of net realized investment gains and losses we do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments see note 3policy loans policy loans are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loans contractual interest rate included in policy loans are 31501 million and 30684 million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively other longterm investments other longterm investments are comprised primarily of tax credit partnerships and private equity partnershipstax credit partnerships in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal the primary sources of investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment these partnerships are accounted for using either the proportional or the effective yield method depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of credit a tax indemnity agreement or another similar arrangement tax credits received from these partnerships are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of premium tax or a reduction of income tax the amortization of the principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of either premium tax or income tax our investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature the underlying investments held by these partnerships include both equity and debt securities and are accounted for using the equity or cost method depending on the level of ownership and the degree of our influence over partnership operating and financial policies for partnerships accounted for under the equity method our portion of partnership earnings is reported as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of income for those partnerships accounted for under the cost method we record income received from partnership distributions as either a component of net investment income or net realized investment gain or loss in accordance with the source of the funds distributed from the partnership see notes 2 and 3shortterm investments shortterm investments are carried at cost shortterm investments include investments maturing within one year such as corporate commercial paper and us treasury bills bank term

102notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedderivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recognized as either other longterm investments or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value the accounting for a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging transaction we formally document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instruments effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure ineffectiveness a derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risks of the hedged item hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship using qualitative and quantitative methods qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationshipchanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge including amounts measured as ineffectiveness and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period in which the termination occurs when interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged itemsto the extent it is effective changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value the gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earningsgains or losses on the termination of ineffective fair value or cash flow hedges are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss in the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedge out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument changes in the fair value of the derivative together with the payment of periodic fees if applicable are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value cash flow activity from the settlement of derivative contracts is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a component of proceeds from sales and maturities of other investmentsin our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreements see notes 2 3 and 4  103notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant accounting policies  continuedfair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date therefore fair value represents an exit price not an entry price the exit price objective applies regardless of our intent andor ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date assets or liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value when actively quoted prices are not available fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities or other observable inputs if observable inputs are not available unobservable inputs andor adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine fair value we categorize our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a threelevel hierarchy based on the significance of the inputs the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 see note 2  realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold see note 3deferred acquisition costs incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts have been deferred such costs include commissions other agency compensation certain selection and policy issue expenses and certain field expenses acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy are excluded from deferral deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing in subsequent yearsdeferred acquisition costs related to noninterest sensitive policies are amortized in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies deferred acquisition costs related to interest sensitive policies are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges mortality margins investment returns and expense margins deviations from projections result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period during which such events occur generally the amortization periods for these policies approximate the estimated lives of the policiesfor certain products policyholders can elect to modify product benefits features rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment endorsement or rider to a contract or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract these transactions are known as internal replacement transactions internal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred internal replacement transactions principally on group contracts that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs loss recognition is performed on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as to future experience as of the date of the test insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests if loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable the deficiency is charged to expense goodwill goodwill is the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the fair values of the reporting units are determined using discounted cash flow models the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings and the discount rate we set our discount rate assumption based on an expected risk adjusted cost of capital if the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the unamortized goodwill the carrying amount is reduced with a corresponding charge to expense  104notes to consolidated financial statements  continued unum group and subsidiariesnote 1  significant

fixed maturity securities derivative financial instruments and unrestricted equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available conversely financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditionsvaluation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach converts future amounts such as cash flows or earnings to a single present amount or a discounted amount the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or the current replacement cost 112notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2  fair values of financial instruments  continuedwe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort in some cases a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities in other cases multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value we evaluate and weigh the results as appropriate considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstancesthe selection of the valuation methods to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach considering the type of investments we hold our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs when using a pricing service we obtain the vendors pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies we periodically review and approve the selection of our pricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies when markets are less active brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker our internal investment management professionals which include portfolio managers and analysts monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions we also consider the nature of the quote particularly whether the quote is a binding offer if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value when relevant market data is unavailable which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty the income approach can in suitable circumstances provide a more appropriate fair value during 2015 we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end 2014 113notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 2

developing pricing we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a securitys price in the event we receive a

financial instruments  continuedan actual trade we also review all price changes from the prior month which fall outside a predetermined corridor the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price these adjustments may be made when in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument the market in which the financial instrument is traded counterparty credit risk credit structure concentration or liquidity additionally an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument in the event an asset is sold we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting periodthe parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies rather the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditionsfair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the liborsetting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values if net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the liborbased fair value obtained from our pricing sources we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources for purposes of valuing net counterparty risk we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions in regard to our own credit risk component we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the liborbased valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities interest rate risk and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangementcertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices andor observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity for these securities we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs including valuations based on estimates of future profitability to estimate the fair value additionally we may obtain prices from independent thirdparty brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include riskfree interest rates risk premiums performance of underlying collateral if any and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active marketat december 31 2015 approximately 68 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from trace pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security comparable to receiving one binding quote the prices obtained were not adjusted and the

maturity securities were valued based on nonbinding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs as discussed belowapproximately 783 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques these assets were classified as level 2 level 2 assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs other than prices included in level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated lifeapproximately 34 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more nonbinding broker quotes if validated by observable market data or on trace prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity when only one price is available it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate these assets for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data were classified as level 2approximately 115 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities matrix pricing market models andor internal models or were valued based on nonbinding quotes with no other observable market data these assets were classified as either level 2 or level 3 with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data level 3 is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date financial assets and liabilities categorized as level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair valuewe consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value we use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary we classify these assets or

shortterm general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days we post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later specified date the fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash received our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in shortterm securities lending agreements these agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities

to our ongoing business operations the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities foreign currency risk and credit risk  historically we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and us treasury rates current and forward currency swaps forward treasury locks currency forward contracts forward contracts on specific fixed income securities and credit default swaps transactions hedging interest rate risk are primarily associated with our individual and group longterm care and individual and group disability products all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposesderivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities an interest rate swap is an agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts we use interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate longterm debtforward treasury locks are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity securities a forward treasury lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific us treasury bond at a future date at a predetermined priceoptions on us treasury rates are used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities these options give us the right but not the obligation to receive a specific interest rate for a specified period of time these options enable us to lock in a minimum investment yield to hedge the potential adverse impact of declining interest ratesderivatives designated as fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as followsinterest rate swaps are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund our floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest additionally we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate longterm debt into floating rate longterm debt under these swap agreements we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interestderivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk are as followsforeign currency interest rate swaps have historically been used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification and to hedge the currency risk associated with certain of the principal and interest payments of the us dollardenominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries for hedges of fixed maturity securities we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment for hedges of debt issued we paid at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments to the counterparty in exchange for fixed rate us dollardenominated principal and interest payments  133notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 4  derivative financial instruments  continuedderivatives not designated as hedging instruments and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk and credit losses on securities owned are as follows foreign currency interest rate swaps previously designated as hedges were used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currencydenominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification we agree to pay at specified intervals fixed rate foreign currencydenominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment we hold offsetting swaps wherein we agree to pay fixed rate principal and interest payments in the functional currency of the operating segment in exchange for fixed rate foreign currencydenominated paymentscredit default swaps are used as economic hedges against credit risk but do not qualify for hedge accounting a credit default swap is an agreement in which we agree with another party to pay at specified intervals a fixedrate fee in exchange for insurance against a credit event on a specific investment if a defined credit event occurs our counterparty may either pay us a net cash settlement or we may surrender the specific investment to them in exchange for cash equal to the full notional amount of the swap credit events typically include events such as bankruptcy failure to pay or certain types of debt restructuring derivative risksthe basic types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market primarily the change in interest and exchange rates and credit risk that the counterparty will not perform according to the terms of the contract the market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position we also typically enter into bilateral crosscollateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount our current credit exposure on derivatives which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position including accrued interest receivable less collateral held was 85 million at december 31 2015 we held cash collateral from our counterparties of 364 million and 154 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we post either fixed maturity securities or cash as collateral to our counterparties the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was 273 million and 670 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we had no cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december 31 2015 and 2014 see note 3 for further discussion of our master netting agreements the majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings should our ratings fall below these specified levels we would be in violation of the provisions and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a liability position was 502 million and 929

million from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized investment gain in our consolidated statements of income we also reclassified the remaining deferred cash flow hedge gain of 277 million from previously terminated derivatives associated with the hedge of this debt from accumulated other comprehensive income to realized investment gain during 2014 we redeemed a portion of this debt and reclassified 131 million the applicable portion of the deferred gain on cash flow hedges from the previously terminated derivatives associated with the hedge of this debt from accumulated other

970 million and a fair value of 295 million to a new counterparty at the time of novation these derivatives were effective hedges and we therefore deferred the unrealized loss into other comprehensive income and will recognize the loss in earnings during the periods in which the hedged items affect earnings in conjunction with the novation these derivatives were dedesignated as hedges and subsequent changes in their fair value will be reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss to establish a new effective hedging relationship with the fixed income

of receive fixed pay variable interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate longterm debt these swaps effectively convert the associated fixed rate longterm debt

preceding chart includes the reserve adjustments as discussed in the following paragraphs which create variances year over year excluding those adjustments the variability exhibited year over year is caused primarily by the level of claim resolutions in the period relative to the longterm expectations reflected in the reserves our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period both favorably and unfavorably 2014 longterm care reserve increasepolicy reserves for our longterm care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and prior to 2014 were valued based on assumptions established as of december 31 2011 the date of the initial loss recognition gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient we undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if appropriate using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the reviewincluded in our 2014 review was an analysis of our reserve assumptions including those for the discount rate mortality and morbidity rates persistency and premium rate increases our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the continued historic low interest rate environment future market expectations and our view of future portfolio yields the assumptions we established in 2011 were set at a level that we estimated would be sustainable in a low interest rate environment for three to five years with improvements in market yields beginning after the third year since that time however interest rates had continued to hover near historic lows and credit spreads had tightened our assumption update for mortality incorporated the last three years of companyspecific experience and emerging trends as well as industry data where available and appropriate and reflected improvements in life expectancies beyond what was initially anticipated in 2011 our morbidity assumptions were updated to reflect trends from our own emerging company experience in claim incidence and terminations as  141notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 6  liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  continuedwell as trends based on available and appropriate industry data and studies our premium rate increase assumptions were updated to reflect progresstodate and our ongoing rate increase strategybased on our analysis at that time we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our revised expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates our revised assumptions anticipated the low interest rate environment persisting for the next three to five years with a return to more historical averages over the following five year period we updated our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize longterm care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant may receive longterm care benefits we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience and we updated our projection of future premium rate increase approvals using our revised best estimate assumptions as of december 31 2014 we determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased 6982 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations of this amount 858 million was related to claim reserves which can be attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart 2013 unclaimed death benefits reserve increasebeginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years during 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimated would be paid under this initiative and as such established 955 million of additional claim reserves for payment of these benefits claim reserves were increased 491 million for unum us group life 263 million for unum us voluntary life and 201 million for colonial life voluntary life the reserves established were attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart2013 group life waiver of premium benefit reserve reductionwithin our unum us segment we offer group life insurance coverage which consists primarily of renewable term life insurance and includes a provision for waiver of premium if disabled the group life waiver of premium benefit group life waiver provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insured or the employer on behalf of the insured is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to a disability the group life waiver claim reserve is the present value of future anticipated death benefits reflecting the probability of death while remaining disabled claim reserves are calculated using assumptions based on past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience and are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations the two fundamental assumptions in the development of the group life waiver reserve are mortality and recovery our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry indicate an increase in life expectancies which decreases the ultimate anticipated death benefits to be paid under the group life waiver benefit emerging experience also reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates which also lessens the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insured is disabled during 2013 we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions for our unum us group life waiver reserves and as a result reduced claim reserves by 850 million of this amount approximately 780 million was attributed to prior year incurred claims thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart 142notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 6  liability

the measurement date to reflect the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the projected cash flows for future benefits  our longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes generated by statistical analysis of the asset portfolio our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists and current market yields the methodology underlying the return assumption includes the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as longterm rates of return volatility of returns and the correlation of returns between various asset classes the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plans strategic asset allocation investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition our mortality rate assumption reflects our best estimate as of the measurement date of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments we derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables  156notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 9  employee benefit plans  continuedthe expected return assumption for the life insurance reserve for our opeb plan at december 31 2015 and 2014 is 575 percent which is based on full investment in fixed income securities with an average book yield of 524 percent and 546 percent in 2015 and 2014 respectivelythe rate of compensation increase assumption for our uk pension plan is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trendsat december 31 2015 and 2014 the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year is 750 percent for each year for benefits payable to both retirees prior to medicare eligibility as well as medicare eligible retirees the rate is assumed to change gradually to 500 percent by 2021 for measurement at december 31 2015 and remain at that level thereafter the medical and dental premiums used to determine the per retiree employer subsidy are capped certain of the current retirees

target capital levels for regulatory and rating agency purposes we modify this formula periodically to recognize changes in the views of capital requirements 167notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 13  segment information  continuedwe measure and analyze our segment performance using nongaap financial measures a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below we believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels a longterm focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is longterm in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses we believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses as well as the 2014 settlement loss resulting from our pension plan amendment from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results although we manage our nonoperating retirementrelated gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit planswe believe that excluding the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt is appropriate because in conjunction with the debt redemption we recognized in realized investment gains and losses a deferred gain from previously terminated derivatives which were associated with the hedge of this debt the amount recognized as a realized investment gain which basically offsets the cost of the debt redemption is also excluded from our nongaap financial measures since we analyze our performance excluding amounts reported as realized investment gains or losses we believe it provides investors with a more realistic view of our overall profitability if we are consistent in excluding both the cost of the debt retirement as well as the gain on the hedge of the debt we may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability  168notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 13  segment information  continueda reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue and

respectivelyat december 31 2015 we had unfunded commitments of 2915 million for certain of our investments the amount of which may or may not be funded contingent liabilities we are a defendant in a number of litigation matters in some of these matters no specified amount is sought in others very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive and treble damages are asserted there is a wide variation of pleading practice permitted in the united states courts with respect to requests for monetary damages including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court further some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts based on our extensive experience and that of others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of the case or the likely disposition value therefore the specific monetary relief sought is not stated unless indicated otherwise in the descriptions below reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies an estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  169notes to consolidated financial statements  continuedunum group and subsidiariesnote 14  commitments and contingent liabilities  continuedclaims handling matters we and our insurance subsidiaries in the ordinary course of our business are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims for our general claim litigation we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course we expect that the ultimate liability if any with respect to general claim litigation after consideration of the reserves maintained will not be material to our consolidated financial condition nevertheless given the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could from time to time have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period depending on the results of operations for the particular period from time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated since each insurance claim is evaluated based on its own merits there is rarely a single act or series of actions which can properly be addressed by a class action nevertheless we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are mademiscellaneous matters     beginning in 2011 a number of state regulators began requiring insurers to crosscheck specified insurance policies with the social security administrations death master file to identify potential matches if a potential match was identified insurers were requested to determine if benefits were due locate beneficiaries and make payments where appropriate we initiated this process where requested and in 2012 we began implementing this process in all states on a forwardlooking basis in addition to implementing this on a forwardlooking basis in 2013 we began an initiative to search for potential claims from previous years  during 2013 we completed our assessment of benefits which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and as such established additional reserves for payment of these benefits similar to other insurers we are undergoing an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states we are cooperating fully with this examination as well as with a delaware market conduct examination involving the same issue the legal and regulatory environment around unclaimed death benefits continues to evolve it is possible that the current examination andor similar investigations by other state jurisdictions may result in additional payments to beneficiaries the payment of abandoned funds under state law andor administrative penalties the total of which may be in excess of the reserves establishedin december 2012 state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v provident life and accident insurance company and state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v colonial life amp accident insurance company were filed in the circuit court of putnam county west virginia these two separate complaints alleged violations of the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act by failing to identify and report all unclaimed insurance policy proceeds due to be escheated to west virginia the complaints sought to examine company records and assess penalties and costs in an undetermined amount in december 2013 the court dismissed both complaints holding that the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act does not require insurance companies to periodically search the social security administrations death master file or escheat unclaimed life insurance benefits until a claim has been submitted in january 2014 the plaintiff appealed the dismissal of both complaints in june 2015 the appellate court reinstated the case holding that the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act requires insurers to make reasonable efforts to determine whether their insureds are still living the case was remanded to the trial court where we answered the complaintsin may 2013 a purported class action complaint was filed in the superior court of california county of los angeles the plaintiff sought to represent a class of california insureds who were issued longterm care policies containing an inflation protection feature the plaintiff alleged we incorrectly administered the inflation protection feature resulting in an underpayment of benefits the complaint made allegations against us for breach of contract bad faith fraud violation of business and professions code 17200 and injunctive relief we removed the case to the united states district court for the central district of california and plaintiff filed an amended complaint on behalf of a nationwide class of insureds who were issued longterm care policies containing an inflation protection feature after we answered the complaint the court permitted the plaintiff to file another amended complaint entitled michael don executor of the estate of ruben don leroy little by and through his guardian ad

filed our opposition in february 2016 the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of settlement for a class of certain insureds issued longterm care policies containing an inflation protection feature as well as certain insureds who requested copies of their longterm care policies the court has not yet ruled on this motion we accrued an estimated loss contingency in 2015 the amount of which was immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations summaryvarious lawsuits against us in addition to those discussed above have arisen in the normal course of business further state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulationsgiven the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses except if noted in connection with specific matters it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending in part on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period we believe however that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification should not have a material adverse effect on our financial positionnote 15  statutory financial informationstatutory net income capital and surplus and dividends  statutory net income for us life insurance companies is reported

the state of vermont is required to follow gaap in accordance with vermont reporting requirements for pure captive insurance companies unless the commissioner permits the use of some other basis of accounting fairwind has permission from vermont to follow accounting practices that are generally consistent with current naic statutory accounting principles for its insurance reserves and invested assets supporting reserves all other assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with gaap as prescribed by vermont which allows for the full recognition of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized statutory accounting principles have a stricter limitation for the recognition of deferred tax assets the impact of following the prescribed and permitted practices of vermont rather than statutory accounting principles prescribed by the naic resulted in higher capital and surplus for fairwind of approximately 208 million and 200 million as of december 31 2015

of our united kingdom insurance subsidiary unum limited were 507 million and 4459 million respectively riskbased capital rbc standards for us life insurance companies are prescribed by the naic the domiciliary states of our us insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the rbc model formula of the naic which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers the basis of the system is a riskbased formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurers business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer the life and health rbc formula is designed to measure annually i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks the formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized state insurance laws grant insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by or take various actions against insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain rbc levels the total adjusted capital of each of our us insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2015 is in excess of those rbc levelsrestrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities for life insurance companies domiciled in the us that limitation generally equals depending on the state of domicile either ten percent of an insurers statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses
