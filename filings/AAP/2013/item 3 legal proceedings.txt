 we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business including litigation arising from claims of employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by current and former team members although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders the damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition future results of operations or cash flow our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants these products have primarily included brake parts many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in type and number and have been immaterial as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company in the future if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows in future periods
