s interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedgesfrom september 2011 through january 2012 we executed a series of forward treasury rate locks in anticipation of the issuance of the 2022 notes the treasury rate locks which are derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges to offset our exposure to increases in the underlying us treasury benchmark rate this rate was used to establish the fixed interest rate for our 2022 notes which was comprised of the underlying us treasury benchmark rate plus a credit spread premium upon issuance of the 2022 notes the cumulative change in fair market value of the treasury rate locks was not significant due to the narrow margin between the lock rate and the underlying treasury rate the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at the companys option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin at december 29 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or an alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 notes or 2022 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 and 450 respectively per annumcredit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses35table of contents
