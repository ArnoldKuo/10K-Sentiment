that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store locationenvironmental matters we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to

our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendorswe own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such

operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to dateitem 1a risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for the products we sell slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock priceoverall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons includinga decrease in the number of vehicles or in the number of annual miles driven because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the needthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions consumers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair and discretionary spending conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehiclesthe average duration of manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles being driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehiclestechnological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our professional and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitablethe sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we competein addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 9table of contentsthese potential competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitableif we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected we have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition adverse changes in our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowsif we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy through new store openings targeted acquisitions and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flowsstore growthwe intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open and operate more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team memberswe also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions including our 2014 acquisition of gpi involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of our acquisitions depend on a number of factors including among other thingsour ability to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable termsthe risk that managements attention may be distractedour ability to retain key personnel from acquired businesses our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and achieve the strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits of the acquisitionwe may incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with acquisitions that may not be offset by the benefits achieved from the acquisition in the near term or at allwe may assume or become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown of the acquired companies which could related to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences 10table of contentssupply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the efficiency and capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems as we integrate gpi and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels if we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increase in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowswe are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive priceswe are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members as of february 23 2017 we employed approximately 74000 team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessour level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and a downgrade in our credit ratings or deterioration in global credit markets or general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 11table of contentslevel of indebtednessour level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligationsin addition the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notesimpact of changes in credit ratings and credit market uncertaintyour overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in its financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affectedin addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from themimpact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance

priority is to stabilize sales growth to consistently deliver positive comparable store sales performance and then turn our attention to bottom  20table of contentsline profitability margins we remain confident in the longterm growth and profitability opportunity as we balance our investments in the business with productivity measures to expand margins2016 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from 2016 includetotal sales during 2016 decreased 17 to 95677 million as compared to 2015 this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in comparable store sales of 14 store closures and the effect of carquest store consolidations partially offset by new store openingsour operating income for 2016 was 7876 million a decrease of 382 million from 2015 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 82 a decrease of 25 basis points as compared to 2015 due to a decrease in our gross profit rate partially offset by a decrease in our sgampa rate our inventory balance as of december 31 2016 increased 1511 million or 36 over the prior year driven mainly by the buildup of transitional inventory associated with our carquest product and store integration that began to drop by the end of the year and the opening of new locations including a new worldpac distribution center we generated operating cash flow of 5009 million during 2016 a decrease of 274 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net income and accounts payablerefer to consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for further details of

to drive permanent cost reductions 21table of contentsthis agenda will be supported and executed with a focus on our talent and culture throughout our company we are hard at work evolving our culture to one which is focused on the customer and driving high levels of accountability ownership and a drive for results throughout the organizationautomotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2017 as continued lower fuel costs a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increasewe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available from the federal highway administration the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased by approximately 30 in 2016 which we attribute primarily to decreased gasoline prices longterm industry forecasts remain favorable as lower gas prices and continued strength in the labor market are expected to result in an annual miles driven growth rate of 2 through 2019number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for the products we sell within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to both routine maintenance requirements and more frequent mechanical failures during 2016 the number of registered vehicles grew 24 to a record 264 million vehicles according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 278 million vehicles by 2019 the average vehicle age which has exceeded 11 years for the past five years also points to favorable growth in the industry despite continued growth in new car registrations the vehicle scrappage rate for 2016 fell to its lowest rate in 14 years resulting in an increase in number of older vehicles on the road as reflected by a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate is 41 for vehicles over 11 years old compared to a compounded annual growth rate for all vehicles of 11 we believe that the average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longerterm as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increased complexity of automobiles  22table of contentsstore developmentwe serve our

17 from net sales in 2015 this decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline of 14 and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated during 2016 we consolidated 159 stores and closed 23 stores which was partially offset by the opening of 78 new stores our decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in overall transactions partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value while the number of comparable store transactions decreased from the comparable period in all four quarters of 2016 we saw improving trends in the second half of the yearour comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by challenges with product availability and service levels particularly in our northeast and great lakes markets on a quarterly basis our comparable store sales decreased 19 41 and 10 in the first second and third quarters of 2016 respectively and increased 31 in the fourth quarter of 2016 we attribute the improvement in our comparable store sales in the last half of the year to our efforts to improve our focus on the customer including sustained investments in availability customer service and incentives for front line employees as well as improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain we also benefited in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the timing of the christmas and new years holidays gross profitgross profit for 2016 was 42559 million or 445 of net sales as compared to 44228 million or 454 of net sales in 2015 a decrease of 94 basis points the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by significantly higher inventory levels in the first half of 2016 and disruption in our distributions centers located in our northeast and great lakes markets resulting from changes in delivery frequency 24table of contentssgampa expensessgampa expenses for 2016 were 34683 million or 363 of net sales as compared to 35970 million or 369 of net sales for 2015 a decrease of 69 basis points this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower gpi integration costs store closure and consolidation expenses and support center restructuring costs in 2016 compared to the prior year excluding these costs sgampa decreased 14 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs partially offset by higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and inventory availability support costs operating incomeoperating income for 2016 was 7876 million representing 82 of net sales as compared to 8258 million or 85 of net sales for 2015 a decrease of 25 basis points this decrease was due to a lower gross margin rate partially offset by a decrease in our sgampa rate these changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sgampa drivers previously discussed interest expenseinterest expense for 2016 was 599 million or 06 of net sales as compared to 654 million or 07 of net sales in 2015 the decrease in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last yearincome taxesincome

reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations the increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to 78 million of settlements recorded in 2016 related to income tax audits of gpi for time periods prior to our acquisition of gpi we believe these settlements will be largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with gpi and therefore recorded corresponding income of 73 million in other income netnet incomenet income was 4596 million or 620 per diluted share for 2016 as compared to 4734

income2015 compared to 2014net salesnet sales for 2015 were 97370 million a decline of 1068 million or 11 over net sales for 2014 this decrease was primarily due to the 53rd week of 2014 which contributed 1504 million in sales to 2014 excluding the impact of the 53rd week net sales for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 while comparable store sales were flat the slight increase in net sales when excluding the 53rd week is due to the addition of 121 new stores partially offset by the portion of sales that did not transfer from the consolidation of 111 stores and closure of 89 stores during 2015 our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by disruptions from integration activities including the alignment of our field structure products and pricing in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our canadian operations reduced comparable store sales for the year by 36 basis points partially offsetting these negative impacts is an estimated 50 basis points of positive contribution from the sales transferred to comparable stores from stores consolidated during 2015 our fourth quarter of 2015 was our weakest quarter in terms of comparable store

results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe the presentation of financial results that exclude noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangibles and nonoperational expenses associated with i the integration of gpi ii store closure and consolidation costs and iii support center restructuring costs is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance and relate to the integration of gpi and store closure activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating managements compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures are useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measuresgpi integration expenses  as disclosed in our filings with the sec we acquired gpi for 208 billion on january 2 2014 and are in the midst of a multiyear integration plan to integrate the operations of gpi with advance auto parts this includes the integration of product brands and assortments supply chain and information technology the integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years the integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015 and our focus has shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems beginning in 2016 due to the size of the acquisition we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business therefore we believe providing additional information in the form of nongaap measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is completed 26table of contentsstore closure and consolidation expenses  store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with our announced plans to i convert and consolidate the carquest stores acquired from gpi ii close our autopart international stores in florida and iii close approximately 80 underperforming advance auto parts stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the conversion and consolidation of the carquest stores is a multiyear process that began in 2014 as of december 31 2016 333 carquest stores acquired from gpi had been consolidated into existing advance auto parts stores and 282 stores had been converted to the advance auto parts format as of december 31 2016 we operated 608 stores under the carquest name the closure of the 40 autopart international stores in florida primarily in the first quarter of 2015 and closure of 80 underperforming advance auto parts stores in the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly exceeded our average historical store closure activity while periodic store closures are common these closures represent major programs outside of our typical market evaluation process we believe it is useful to provide additional nongaap measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance we also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our nongaap measures support center restructuring expenses  the costs excluded for support center restructuring activities include costs associated with i closing our minnesota office and relocating functions to existing offices ii relocating functions within our roanoke va office and raleigh nc office formerly the headquarters for gpi and iii eliminating duplicative functions between these two offices these actions are a direct consequence of the acquisition and integration of gpi and therefore we do not consider these expenses to be normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business these actions were substantially completed as of the end of fiscal 2015 and we have had no material store support center restructuring expenses following the end of fiscal 2015we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures

requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures the payment of income taxes and funding of our strategic business plan in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict the liquidity needs for our domestic operationsas of december 31 2016 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1352 million an increase of 444 million compared to january 2 2016 this increase in cash was primarily a result of net cash generated from operations partially offset by capital expenditures and net repayments on credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2016 activity to 2015 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of december 31 2016 our outstanding indebtedness was 10433 million consisting primarily of our senior unsecured notes this is 1636 million lower when compared to january 2 2016 as a result of net payments on our credit facility as of december 31 2016 we had no borrowings under our term loan or revolving credit facility we had 1007 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 8993 million as of december 31 2016 capital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores investments in supply chain and information technology and gpi integration expenditures we lease approximately 84 of our stores our capital expenditures were 2596 million in 2016 an increase of 248 million from 2015 our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi in 2017 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2500 million but may vary with business conditions these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and systems we anticipate opening between 75 to 85 stores and branches during 2017  28table of contentsstock repurchaseswe have a stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase our

net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable lower net income and the timing of payments within working capital partially offset by the timing of income tax deductions our inventory balance as of december 31 2016 increased 1511 million or 36 over the prior year driven mainly by the buildup of transitional inventory associated with our carquest product

2016 we had a credit rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in  30table of contentsaddition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance

within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above tablecritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of december 31 2016 our goodwill balance was allocated to four reporting units effective in the second quarter of 2016 we realigned our operating segments resulting in a reevaluation of our reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment lossour indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment losswe complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sgampa rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates the carrying value of goodwill was 9909 million and 9895 million at december 31 2016 and january 2 2016 respectively the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets was 3355 million and 3347 million at december 31 2016 and january 2 2016 respectively the increase to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2016 was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit or asset group exceeded the carrying values of the respective goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset and therefore no impairment existed we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material  32table of contentschange in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 31 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 36 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2016 2015 and 2014 were 906 million 704 million and 494 million respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2016 was primarily related to an increase in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported product and an increase in our shrink reserve based on timing of our cycle counts and a slight increase in our shrinkage rate the increase in our inventory reserves in 2015 was primarily due to estimated shrink on a higher volume of product returns associated with our product changeovers and conversions and increases to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported productshrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted in the majority of our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 31 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 56 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  33table of contentsselfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2016 2015 and 2014 were 1406 million 1340 million and 1370 million respectively our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three yearsour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 31 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 87 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is soldvendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 2111 million and 2107 million as of december 31 2016 and january 2 2016 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 31 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 131 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016warranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 34table of contentsa 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 31 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 29 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016new accounting pronouncementsfor a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form 10kitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances and have designated these hedges as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2016 the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 31 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or term loan however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annumcredit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit lossesforeign currency exchange rate riskour primary foreign currency exposure arises from our canadian operations and the translation of canadian dollar denominated revenues profits and net assets into us dollars during 2016 the translation of the operating results of our canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income we view our investments in the canadian subsidiaries as longterm and any changes in our net assets in the canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of the companys inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances we believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices gains from foreign currency transactions which are included in other income net were 07

liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment datethe company recognizes tax benefits andor tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as the company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes the company reevaluates these uncertain tax

available in instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy the fair value measurement has been categorized based on the lowest level input

manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products the company and some of its other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many asbestosrelated lawsuits the automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts the plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the cases pending against the company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages f32table of contentsadvance auto parts inc and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementsdecember 31 2016 january 2 2016 and january 3 2015in thousands except

dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although the company and its subsidiaries diligently defend against these claims the company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interests of the companys shareholders the company believes that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date the company does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results financial position or liquidity however if the company andor a subsidiary were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and was ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on its operating results financial position and liquidity historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and the companys liability if any could vary widely as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company or any subsidiary in the future if the number of claims filed against the company or any of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on its operating results financial position or liquidity in future periods the company is involved in various types of legal proceedings related to employment or arising from claims of discrimination as a result of claims by current and former team members or others the damages claimed against the company in some of these proceedings are substantial because of the uncertainty of the outcome of such legal matters and because the companys liability if any could vary widely including the size of any damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any negotiated settlement the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise the company is also involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined based on the facts presently known it is managements opinion that the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of
