products from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online prior acquisitionson january 2 2014 we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion gpi formerly a privatelyheld company was a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac names as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233 carquest stores and 103 worldpac branches located in 45 states and canada and served approximately 1400 independentlyowned carquest stores as of the end of 2015 we have converted 170 and consolidated 178 of these stores into advance auto parts locations on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwps rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2015 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operationsfor additional information on these acquisitions refer to note 3 acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 22table of contentsmanagement overview we generated diluted earnings per share or diluted eps of 640 during 2015 compared to 671 for 2014 the decrease in our diluted eps was driven primarily by costs associated with the integration of gpi store closure and consolidation costs and support center restructuring costs in addition the prior year benefited from an additional week of operations due to our 53week fiscal year when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable diluted earnings per share comparable cash eps in 2015 was 782

for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 and comparable store sales were flat our sales results decelerated in the second half of the year due to the impact of gpi integration activities and the negative impact of warmer weather late in the year we began 2015 with an aggressive plan to complete a large part of our integration of gpi during 2015 and we completed several parts of the integration including 240 carquest store consolidations and conversions support center consolidations the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment the multitude of changes proved to be more challenging than anticipated and disrupted two key areas of our operations  i customer service levels and ii inventory availability in addition to integrating the carquest operations we are also focused on achieving the cost synergies expected from the acquisition and on other cost control initiatives in 2015 we achieved approximately 1100 million of planned acquisition synergies which was 50 million incremental to 2014 in addition we closed 79 underperforming stores during the fourth quarter of 2015 which is expected to drive productivity improvements in the near future during 2016 we plan to drive additional cost reduction and pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations2015 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our 2015 includetotal sales during 2015 decreased 11 to 97370 million as compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily driven by 1504 million in sales from the 53rd week of 2014 and store consolidations and closures partially offset by new store openingsour operating income for 2015 was 8258 million a decrease of 259 million from 2014 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 85 a decrease of 17 basis points as compared to 2014 due to an increase in our sgampa rate partially offset by a higher gross profit rate our inventory balance as of january 2 2016 increased 2378 million or 60 over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and brancheswe generated operating cash flow of 6896 million during 2015 a decrease of 27 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in net income partially offset by changes in working capitalwe consolidated 80 and converted 160 carquest stores into advance auto parts stores and aligned our products and pricing in our advance auto parts and carquest storesrefer to the consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively  23table of contentsbusiness update our overarching focus in 2016 will be on becoming a fieldcentric organization while continuing to achieve our gpi integration milestones with less overall disruption to our stores and customers in addition we have the following three priorities which we believe are critical in the success of our fieldcentric organization and producing favorable financial results over the longtermsuperior availability is aimed at product availability and ensuring our stores have the right part at the right time when a customer needs it we will empower our store general managers to make more decisions and tailor their inventories to best serve their unique local customer bases we will continue to improve localized parts availability through leveraging our hub stores and expanded delivery frequency from our distribution centers outstanding customer service involves providing the proper infrastructure to achieve our operational goals through flawless execution in meeting our commercial customers needs and goal of becoming a commercial first business sales to commercial customers remain the largest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales were 57 in both 2015 and 2014 we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by providing the appropriate incentives and training to develop focused and inspired teams that are empowered to make decisions in their local markets we will continue to educate our field teams and customers about the high quality parts and brands we offer and emphasize our customer retention membership programs including technet prorewards and speedperks we believe that by focusing on commercial customers we will naturally build the availability and customer service that will also benefit our diy customers focused and inspired team is a team that is dedicated to generating sales in a more simplified environment has the empowerment to execute the two priorities above and drives improvements across the entire company to deliver profitable growth our multiyear gpi integration plan remains underway which is focused on the integration of our advance auto parts and carquest operations during 2015 we completed the support center consolidations that were initiated in 2014 integrated our field teams harmonized pricing and brands and substantially completed product changeovers in addition we completed the first major wave of the carquest store consolidations and conversions that we began in the second half of 2014 during 2016 we will continue executing our integration plans by consolidating or converting an estimated additional 325 to 350 carquest stores in addition we will shift our focus to the deployment of systems necessary to align critical capabilities within supply chain and information technologyautomotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2016 as lower fuel costs a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increasewe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased by 28 in 2015 setting a new alltime high due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices while current industry indicators are favorable longterm demographics are expected to contain growth rates for miles driven as the labor force participation rate remains below prerecession levels due to an increase in the retirementage population in addition younger drivers are not increasing vehicle usage as fast as the older generation is decreasing usage which is expected to pressure growth in the number of miles driven while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic and demographic pressures impacting demand we believe we will continue to see increases in total miles driven which will drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 24table of contentsnumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for the products we sell within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to both routine maintenance requirements and more frequent mechanical failures during 2015 the number of registered vehicles grew 21 to a record 258 million vehicles according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 277 million vehicles by 2018 the average vehicle age which has exceeded 11 years for the past four years also points to favorable growth in the industry while new car registrations during 2015 were almost 60 higher than in the recession low of 2009 the scrappage rate for 2015 was at its lowest rate in 13 years as a result the mix of vehicles is shifting as reflected by a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of 44 for vehicles over 11 years old compared to a compounded annual growth rate for all vehicles of 07 we believe that the stabilization of the average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longerterm as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts  store developmentwe serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store and branch development activity for the year ended january 2 2016 including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with commercial delivery programs during 2016 we anticipate adding approximately 65 to 75 new

to both our commercial and diy customers sales from our ecommerce websites and sales to independentlyowned carquest stores sales are recorded net of discounts and rebates sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales sales to independentlyowned carquest stores are excluded from our comparable store sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date approximately one year comparable store sales growth for 2014 and 2015 excludes sales from the 53rd week of 2014  25table of contentscost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses including depreciation and amortization gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs and mix of commercial and diy sales see note 1

flat the slight increase in net sales when excluding the 53rd week is due to the addition of 121 new stores partially offset by the portion of sales that did not transfer from the consolidation of 111 stores and closure of 89 stores during 2015 our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by disruptions from integration activities including the alignment of our field structure products and pricing in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our canadian operations reduced comparable store sales for the year by 36 basis points partially offsetting these

overviewour primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures the payment of income taxes and funding of our gpi integration activities in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict the liquidity needs for our domestic operationsas of january 2 2016 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 908 million a decrease of 139 million compared to january 3 2015 this decrease in cash was primarily a result of net payments on credit facilities and purchases of property and equipment partially offset by cash generated from operations additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2015 activity to 2014 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of january 2 2016 our outstanding indebtedness was 12138 million inclusive of our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes this is 4231 million lower when compared to january 3 2015 as a result of net payments on our credit facilities as of january 2 2016 we had borrowings of 800 million under our term loan and 800 million under our credit facility additionally we had 1186 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 8014 million as of january 2 2016 capital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and outstanding customer service priorities including supply chain and information technology and gpi integration expenditures we lease approximately 85 of our stores our capital expenditures were 2347 million in 2015 an increase of 63 million from 2014 our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi in 2016 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2600 million to 2800 million these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain

payable our inventory balance as of january 2 2016 increased 2378 million or 60 over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and branches these decreases in cash flow were partially offset by increases in cash flow from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of rent and other payments to nonmerchandise vendorsfor 2014 net cash provided by operating activities increased 1637 million to 7090 million this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both

january 2 2016 we had a credit rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet arrangements we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 297 million as of january 2 2016 these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of january 2 2016 we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual

2023 respectively 2 we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the applicable lease term any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 3 includes the longterm portion of deferred income taxes and other liabilities including selfinsurance reserves for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond 12 months from january 2 2016 accordingly the related balances have not been reflected in the

fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above tablecritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 2 2016 our goodwill balance was allocated to six reporting units effective in the first quarter of 2015 we realigned our operating segments resulting in a reevaluation of our reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment losswe complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sgampa rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates the carrying value of goodwill was 9895 million and 9954 million at january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets was 3347 million and 3394 million at january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively the decrease to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2015 was due to changes in  35table of contentsforeign currency exchange rates for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit or asset group exceeded the carrying values of the respective goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset and therefore no impairment existed we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 28 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 704 million 494 million and 375 million respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the increase in our inventory reserves in 2015 was primarily due to estimated shrink on a higher volume of product returns associated with our product changeovers and conversions and increases to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported productshrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our shrink rate has not fluctuated significantly over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the yearour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will  36table of contentsresult in retail prices below recorded costs we are also in the process of integrating gpi and we expect the integration to continue for multiple years final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans which might impact our estimated reserves for excess and obsolete inventoriesfuture changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 44 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 1340 million 1370 million and 985 million respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three yearsour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 84 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is soldvendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 2107 million and 1798 million as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 133 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 37table of contentswarranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 28 million for the fiscal year
