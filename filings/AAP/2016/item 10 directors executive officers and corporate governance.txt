training and iv a shop management system seasonalityour business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our commercial and diy salesteam members

wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store locationenvironmental matters we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendorswe own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date 9table of contentsitem 1a risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles if the number andor average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our productsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both commercial and diy customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our commercial and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more desirable store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affectedthese competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to  10table of contentsaddress these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable we may not be able to successfully integrate gpis operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant integration costs and our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financingintegration issues and business expectationswe cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpis operations with ours this integration is complex and our failure to integrate quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investorsthe acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and team members which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations in particular we could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsin connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification periodadditional integration costsin connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all level of indebtednessin connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes associated with the acquisition of gpiin addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our  11table of contentslongterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such noteswe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales and enhance our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2872 stores at the end of our 2005 fiscal year to 5293 stores as of january 2 2016 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team memberswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets supply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable  12table of contentsto us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive priceswe are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members as of february 26 2016 we employed approximately 73000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified executive and other team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified executive and other team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there is also a risk that we may experience difficulty in successfully implementing announced leadership changes including a failure to ensure the effective transfer of knowledge necessary for the persons appointed to lead and provide results in their new role potential disruption to our business resulting from the announced changes and the impact of announced leadership changes on our relationships with customers suppliers and business partners the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the  13table of contentsglobal credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affectedin addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance impact on operating costsrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance

results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory

additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial

shipped directly to them our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online prior acquisitionson january 2 2014 we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion gpi formerly a privatelyheld company was a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac names as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233 carquest stores and 103 worldpac branches located in 45 states and canada and served approximately 1400 independentlyowned carquest stores as of the end of 2015 we have converted 170 and consolidated 178 of these stores into advance auto parts locations on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwps rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2015 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operationsfor additional information on these acquisitions refer to note 3 acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 22table of contentsmanagement overview we generated diluted earnings per share or diluted eps of 640 during 2015 compared to 671 for 2014 the decrease in our diluted eps was driven primarily by costs associated with the integration of gpi store closure and consolidation costs and support center restructuring costs in addition the prior year benefited from an additional week of operations due to our 53week fiscal year when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable diluted earnings per share comparable cash eps in 2015 was 782 compared to 759 during 2014  2015 2014gpi integration

of nongaap financial measures section for further details of our comparable adjustmentsexcluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2014 total sales for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 and comparable store sales were flat our sales results decelerated in the second half of the year due to the impact of gpi integration activities and the negative impact of warmer weather late in the year we began 2015 with an aggressive plan to complete a large part of our integration of gpi during 2015 and we completed several parts of the integration including 240 carquest store consolidations and conversions support center consolidations the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment the multitude of changes proved to be more challenging than anticipated and disrupted two key areas of our operations  i customer service levels and ii inventory availability in addition to integrating the carquest operations we are also focused on achieving the cost synergies expected from the acquisition and on other cost control initiatives in 2015 we achieved approximately 1100 million of planned acquisition synergies which was 50 million incremental to 2014 in addition we closed 79 underperforming stores during the fourth quarter of 2015 which is expected to drive productivity improvements in the near future during 2016 we plan to drive additional cost reduction and pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations2015 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our 2015 includetotal sales during 2015 decreased 11 to 97370 million as compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily driven by 1504 million in sales from the 53rd week of 2014 and store consolidations and closures partially offset by new store openingsour operating income for 2015 was 8258 million a decrease of 259 million from 2014 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 85 a decrease of 17 basis points as compared to 2014 due to an increase in our sgampa rate partially offset by a higher gross profit rate our inventory balance as of january 2 2016 increased 2378 million or 60 over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and brancheswe generated operating cash flow of 6896 million during 2015 a decrease of 27 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in net income partially offset by changes in working capitalwe consolidated 80 and converted 160 carquest stores into advance auto parts stores and aligned our products and pricing in our advance auto parts and carquest storesrefer to the consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively  23table of contentsbusiness update our overarching focus in 2016 will be on becoming a fieldcentric organization while continuing to achieve our gpi integration milestones with less overall disruption to our stores and customers in addition we have the following three priorities which we believe are critical in the success of our fieldcentric organization and producing favorable financial results over the longtermsuperior availability is aimed at product availability and ensuring our stores have the right part at the right time when a customer needs it we will empower our store general managers to make more decisions and tailor their inventories to best serve their unique local customer bases we will continue to improve localized parts availability through leveraging our hub stores and expanded delivery frequency from our distribution centers outstanding customer service involves providing the proper infrastructure to achieve our operational goals through flawless execution in meeting our commercial customers needs and goal of becoming a commercial first business sales to commercial customers remain the largest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales were 57 in both 2015 and 2014 we must meet the needs of our customers at a local level by providing the appropriate incentives and training to develop focused and inspired teams that are empowered to make decisions in their local markets we will continue to educate our field teams and customers about the high quality parts and brands we offer and emphasize our customer retention membership programs including technet prorewards and speedperks we believe that by focusing on commercial customers we will naturally build the availability and customer service that will also benefit our diy customers focused and inspired team is a team that is dedicated to generating sales in a more simplified environment has the empowerment to execute the two priorities above and drives improvements across the entire company to deliver profitable growth our multiyear gpi integration plan remains underway which is focused on the integration of our advance auto parts and carquest operations during 2015 we completed the support center consolidations that were initiated in 2014 integrated our field teams harmonized pricing and brands and substantially completed product changeovers in addition we completed the first major wave of the carquest store consolidations and conversions that we began in the second half of 2014 during 2016 we will continue executing our integration plans by consolidating or converting an estimated additional 325 to 350 carquest stores in addition we will shift our focus to the deployment of systems necessary to align critical capabilities within supply chain and information technologyautomotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2016 as lower fuel costs a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increasewe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased by 28 in 2015 setting a new alltime high due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices while current industry indicators are favorable longterm demographics are expected to contain growth rates for miles driven as the labor force participation rate remains below prerecession levels due to an increase in the retirementage population in addition younger drivers are not increasing vehicle usage as fast as the older generation is decreasing usage which is expected to pressure growth in the number of miles driven while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic and demographic pressures impacting demand we believe we will continue to see increases in total miles driven which will drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 24table of contentsnumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for the products we sell within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to both routine maintenance requirements and more frequent mechanical failures during 2015 the number of registered vehicles grew 21 to a record 258 million vehicles according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 277 million vehicles by 2018 the average vehicle age which has exceeded 11 years for the past four years also points to favorable growth in the industry while new car registrations during 2015 were almost 60 higher than in the recession low of 2009 the scrappage rate for 2015 was at its lowest rate in 13 years as a result the mix of vehicles is shifting as reflected by a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of 44 for vehicles over 11 years old compared to a compounded annual growth rate for all vehicles of 07 we believe that the stabilization of the average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longerterm as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts  store developmentwe serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store and branch development activity for the year ended january 2 2016 including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with

may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry

week net sales for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 while comparable store sales were flat the slight increase in net sales when excluding the 53rd week is due to the addition of 121 new stores partially offset by the portion of sales that did not transfer from the consolidation of 111 stores and closure of 89 stores during 2015 our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by disruptions from integration activities including the alignment of our field structure products and pricing in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our canadian operations reduced comparable store sales for the year by 36 basis points partially offsetting these negative impacts is an estimated 50 bps of positive contribution from the sales transferred to comparable stores from

property and equipment partially offset by cash generated from operations additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2015 activity to 2014 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of january 2 2016 our outstanding indebtedness was 12138 million inclusive of our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes this is 4231 million lower when compared to january 3 2015 as a result of net payments on our credit facilities as of january 2 2016 we had borrowings of 800 million under our term loan and 800 million under our credit facility additionally we had 1186 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 8014 million as of january 2 2016 capital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and outstanding customer service priorities including supply chain and information technology and gpi integration expenditures we lease approximately 85 of our stores our capital expenditures were 2347 million in 2015 an increase of 63 million from 2014 our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi in 2016 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2600 million to 2800 million these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores

activitiesfor 2015 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 193 million to 6896 million this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by lower net income the timing of income tax deductions and an increase in cash outflows from inventory purchases net of accounts payable our inventory balance as of january 2 2016 increased 2378 million or 60 over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and branches these decreases in cash flow were partially offset by increases in cash flow from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of rent and other payments to nonmerchandise vendorsfor 2014 net cash provided by operating activities increased 1637 million to 7090 million this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both carquest and advance auto parts investing activitiesfor 2015 net cash used in investing activities decreased by

secured by liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactionsas of january 2 2016 we had a credit rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet arrangements we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 297 million as of january 2 2016 these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of january 2 2016 we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk

space equipment and vehicles our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the applicable lease term any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 3 includes the longterm portion of deferred income taxes and other liabilities including selfinsurance reserves for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments

purchase goods or services that are enforceable legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above tablecritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 2 2016 our goodwill balance was allocated to six reporting units effective in the first quarter of 2015 we realigned our operating segments resulting in a reevaluation of our reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment losswe complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sgampa rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates the carrying value of goodwill was 9895 million and 9954 million at january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets was 3347 million and 3394 million at january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively the decrease to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2015 was due to changes in  35table of contentsforeign currency exchange rates for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit or asset group exceeded the carrying values of the respective goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset and therefore no impairment existed we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 28 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 704 million 494 million and 375 million respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the increase in our inventory reserves in 2015 was primarily due to estimated shrink on a higher volume of product returns associated with our product changeovers and conversions and increases to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported productshrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our shrink rate has not fluctuated significantly over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the yearour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will  36table of contentsresult in retail prices below recorded costs we are also in the process of integrating gpi and we expect the integration to continue for multiple years final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans which might impact our estimated reserves for excess and obsolete inventoriesfuture changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 44 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 1340 million 1370 million and 985 million respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three yearsour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 84 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is soldvendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 2107 million and 1798 million as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 133 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 37table of contentswarranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 2 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 28 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016new accounting pronouncementsfor a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form 10kitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of january 2 2016 the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 2 2016 we had 800 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and 800 million outstanding under our term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annumthe table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan outstanding at january 2 2016 by expected maturity dates weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at

vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses 38table of contentsforeign currency exchange rate riskour primary foreign currency exposure arises from our canadian operations and the translation of canadian dollar denominated revenues profits and net assets into us dollars during 2015 the translation of the operating results of our canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income we view our investments in the canadian subsidiaries as longterm and any changes in our net assets in the canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of the companys inventory purchases which are denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances we believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices losses from foreign currency transactions which are included in other income
