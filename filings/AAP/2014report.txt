vi internetbased parts providers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of

condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our productsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts our vendors because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected our reputation and our brands because our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity it could reduce demand for our products the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more lucrative store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our  10table of contentscurrent operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable we may not be able to successfully integrate gpis operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant transaction and integration costs our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and we may not be able to retain key gpi personnelintegration issues and business expectationswe cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpis operations with ours this integration may be complex and failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investorsthe acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding gpis and our businesses including affecting gpis and our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on gpis and our business financial results and operations in particular gpi and advance could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsin connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances and occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnificationadditional transaction and integration costsin connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant onetime transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all level of indebtednessin connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes associated with the acquisition of gpi 11table of contentsin addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notesretention of key gpi personnelthe success of the integration with gpi will depend in part on the ability to retain key gpi employees who are expected to continue employment with the combined company if any of these employees decide not to remain with the combined company it is possible we may be unable to locate suitable replacements for such key employees or to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms in addition if key employees terminate their employment managements attention might be diverted from successfully integrating gpis operations to hiring suitable replacements and the combined companys business might suffer we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2539 stores at the end of our 2003 fiscal year to 4049 stores as of december 28 2013 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified sales associates 12table of contentswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets supply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standardsif our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members as of february 20 2014 we employed 71867 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under  13table of contentsour revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at relatively high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate payroll taxes increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 and many consumers are now facing increased healthcare costs as a result of the recently enacted affordable care act this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed impact on operating costsrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and  14table of contentsadversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to

specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts accessories batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states our stores carry an extensive product line for cars vans sport utility vehicles and light trucks we serve both diy and commercial customers our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers as of december 28 2013 we operated 4049 stores throughout 39 states puerto rico and the virgin islandsas of december 28 2013 we operated in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern southeastern and midwestern inclusive of south central regions of the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands these stores operate under the trade name advance auto parts except for certain stores in the state of florida which operate under the advance discount auto parts trade name as of december 28 2013 we operated 3832 stores in the aap segment our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks through our integrated operating

the ai segment under the autopart international trade name ais business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states management overview we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 532 during fiscal 2013 compared to 522 for fiscal 2012 negatively impacting our diluted eps in fiscal 2013 were 270 million of transaction related expenses related to our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and 80 million of expenses associated with our integration of bwp excluding these impacts our operating income accelerated in the second half of our fiscal year primarily due to improving sales and more disciplined cost control throughout much of fiscal 2013 our sales remained constrained in many of our markets in part due to the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and increased competition in our operating area we believe consumer spending was suppressed as consumers faced higher payroll taxes the uncertainty regarding the federal government shutdown and the apprehension regarding the impact of health care reform we believe that our core consumers are performing only the repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road which has resulted in a significant level of deferred maintenance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 our sales accelerated particularly in some of our colder weather markets driven by the extraordinary cold weather which has increased the demand for failure and maintenance parts we continue to generate a significant amount of cash onhand to invest in capital improvements and initiatives to support our key strategies superior availability and service leadership which are discussed later in the business update 23table of contentsfiscal 2013 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our fiscal 2013 includefinancialtotal sales during fiscal 2013 increased 47 to 64938 million as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily driven by the addition of the 124 acquired bwp stores and 151 other net new stores partially offset by a 15 decrease in comparable store sales our operating income for fiscal 2013 was 6603 million an increase of 30 million from the comparable period in fiscal 2012 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 102 a decrease of 42 basis

increase in inventory net of accounts payableotheron december 31 2012 we completed the acquisition of bwp a leading commercial provider in the northeastin december 2013 we issued 450 million of principal amount of 450 senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and entered into a new credit agreement in anticipation of our acquisition of gpisubsequent to fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisition of gpi a leading privatelyheld distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket automotive replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brandsrefer to the results of operations and liquidity sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively business update our two key strategies are superior availability and service leadership superior availability is aimed at product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution of customerfacing initiatives to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our diy and commercial customers in our stores and online through these two key strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the biggest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 404 in fiscal 2013 compared to 381 in fiscal 2012 this increase has been more pronounced in fiscal 2013 due to the contribution of the acquired bwp stores which are more weighted in commercial sales than our advance storesour strategic priorities includegrowing our commercial business through improved delivery speed and reliability increased customer retention increased volume with national and regional accounts and the integrations of bwp and gpi respectivelyimproving localized parts availability through the continued increase in the number of our larger hub stores strengthened focus on instore availability and leveraging the advancement of our supply chain infrastructure beginning with our new remington distribution centeraccelerating our new store growth rate andcontinuing our focus on store execution through more effective scheduling increased productivity and simplification improved product onhand accuracy expanded sales training and continued measurement of customer engagementacquisitionson december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp  24table of contentsoperated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwps rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi we believe this acquisition will enable us to continue our expansion in the competitive northeast which is a strategic growth area for us due to the large population and overall size of the market and to gain valuable information to apply to our existing operations as a result of bwps expertise in commercial during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we began integrating the 124 bwp companyowned stores and two distribution centers into our advance auto parts operations and plan to finish the integration by mid2014 the integration of bwp stores consists of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations after the 2013 fiscal year we acquired general parts international inc on january 2 2014 for a purchase price of 208 billion gpi formerly a privately held company is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and automotive aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1248 carquest stores and 105 worldpac branches located in 45 states and canada and serviced approximately 1400 independentlyowned carquest stores we believe the acquisition of gpi will allow us to expand our geographic presence commercial capabilities and overall scale to better serve customers for additional information on the gpi acquisition refer to note 23 subsequent event in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules of this annual report on form 10k automotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continues to impact us and the retail industry in general while we believe that the current macroeconomic environment continues to constrain consumer spending we remain confident that the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry are positive furthermore we continue to believe we are well positioned to serve our customers by meeting their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environmentwe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items while miles driven in the us remained relatively flat during 2012 miles driven began to increase beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2013 and continuing through the end of the year historically rapid increases in fuel prices have negatively impacted total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel in 2012 and 2013 gas prices were relatively flat and have become somewhat less volatile when compared to prior years another factor impacting miles driven is the average daily commute which corresponds to the unemployment rate as the unemployment rate improves as it has over the past two years the number of employees commuting increases and in turn the number of miles driven increases while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic pressures on our consumers the return of increases in miles driven and stabilization in gasoline prices and improvements in the unemployment rate will continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industrynumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry there were 248 million vehicles on the road in 2013 which is 6 higher than in 2003 while recent industry data reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia indicates that the growth in number of vehicles on the road has decelerated and new vehicle registrations are increasing the average age of vehicle continues to increase the average age of vehicles has gradually increased over the last five years from 103 years in 2009 to 113 years in 2013 we believe that the average age of vehicles continues to increase due to relatively constant scrappage rates a rate of new car sales well under the 10year trend and an increase in overall quality of vehicles as the average age of a vehicle increases a larger percentage of the miles driven are outside of the manufacturer warranty period these outofwarranty older vehicles generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures we believe that despite an improving economy consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer contributing to the trend of an aging vehicle population  25table

we have not yet finalized the allocation of openings between aap ai and worldpac components of statement of operationsnet sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our ecommerce website our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods

and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume commitments when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to

primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our new credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year including our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and its ongoing operationas of december 28 2013 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 11125 million an increase of 5144 million compared to december 29 2012 the end of fiscal 2012 this increase in cash was primarily a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of senior unsecured notes partially offset by investments in property and equipment and cash used in the acquisition of bwp additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of fiscal 2013 activity to fiscal 2012 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of december 28 2013 our outstanding indebtedness was 10536 million or 4485 million higher when compared to december 29 2012 as a result of additional borrowings of 4486 million under our senior unsecured notes issued on december 3 2013 additionally we had 873 million in letters of credit outstanding the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies our debt availability as of december 28 2013 was 5454 million based on the maximum amount of additional borrowings allowed under our leverage ratio subsequent to december 28 2013 our debt availability was updated in accordance with our new credit facility to reflect the additional borrowings related to the gpi acquisition gpi acquisitionsubsequent to december 28 2013 we borrowed 10060 million which we used along with cash onhand to fund the 208 billion acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the normal operations of gpi we will incur a significant amount of integration costs over the next three years in conjunction with the integration of gpi capital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and information technology our capital expenditures were 1958 million in fiscal 2013 a decrease of 754 million from fiscal 2012 in addition to routine capital expenditures our capital investments during fiscal 2013 included the acquisition of bwp for 1861 millionour future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in our existing stores information technology and our supply chain network in fiscal  30table of contents2014 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 325 million  350 million these investments will be primarily driven by new store

rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet

timing of the transaction included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do  34table of contentsnot have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above tablecritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1113 million and 1030 million as of december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 28 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 70 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 375 million 314 million and 308 million respectivelyshrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 10 basis points over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 35table of contentsour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs in fiscal 2013 the increase in our inventory reserves was driven primarily by our continued rampup in the sale of imported products and the lack of return privileges with those vendors future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 28 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 23 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013 warranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 28 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 25 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 985 million 945 million and 989 million respectively historically our total selfinsurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles partially offset by favorable claims development in the last two years when excluding 42 million of reserves from our acquisition of bwp in fiscal 2013 our selfinsurance reserves were essentially flat with the prior yearour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 28 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 62 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013goodwill and intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm  36table of contentswe determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth we have allocated our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within each of our reportable segments to multiple reporting units in our aap segment and to the entire ai segment respectively during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test for the presented periods the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 28 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 18 million for the fiscal year ended

financial statements see new accounting pronouncements in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form 10kitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 28 2013 the interest rate on borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and term loan is based at the companys option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 28 2013 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or term loan subsequent to december 28 2013 we borrowed on the revolving  37table of contentscredit facility and term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annumcredit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be
