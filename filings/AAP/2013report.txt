while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to

trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them7table of contentscompetition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boysmanny moe amp jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store locationenvironmental matters we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendorswe own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to dateitem 1a risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our products8table of contentsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts our vendors because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected our reputation and our brands because our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity it could reduce demand for our products the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 9table of contentssuccessful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2435 stores at the end of fiscal 2002 to 3794 stores at december 29 2012 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associateswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets acquisition integrationon december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc strategic acquisitions have been and may continue to be an element of our growth strategy in the future acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the followingwe may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable termsour managements attention may be distractedwe may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesseswe may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problemswe may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses we acquire to realize economic operational and other benefits andwe may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we as a successor owner or operator may be liable10table of contentssupply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standardsif our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 22 2013 we employed approximately 55000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 11table of contentsour overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate at lower levels and payroll taxes have recently increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed impact on operating expensesrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the implementation of healthcare and financial reform legislation as well as pending regulatory rules regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin of conflict minerals in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business adversely affecting our results of operations additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and

parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have

included brake parts many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do

under the autopart international trade name ais business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states management overviewwe generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 522 during fiscal 2012 compared to 511 for fiscal 2011 the increase in our diluted eps was driven by a lower average share count during fiscal 2012 partially offset by a decrease in operating income throughout most of fiscal 2012 our sales remained constrained particularly in our colder weather markets driven by the unseasonably warmer temperatures which has decreased the demand for failure and maintenance parts the uncertainty in the us economy also impacted our sales consistent with many other retailers including our peer companies in the automotive aftermarket industry as consumers faced high unemployment fluctuating gas prices and low consumer confidence in response to the difficult sales environment we focused on providing better service to our commercial customers and improving weekend staffing to better serve our diy customers despite our lower performance in fiscal 2012 we remain encouraged by i the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry ii initiatives that are underway in support of our strategies and iii our growth potential in the more fragmented and faster growing commercial market while our operating income in fiscal 2012 declined from the comparable period of last year we generated a significant amount of operating cash flow to enable us to invest in capital projects and initiatives to support our strategies as discussed later in the business and industry update we remain committed to investing in our two key strategies  superior availability and service leadership 21table of contentsfiscal 2012 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our fiscal 2012 includefinancialtotal sales during fiscal 2012 increased 06 to 62050 million as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily driven by the addition of 132 net new stores partially offset by a 08 decrease in comparable store sales our operating income for fiscal 2012 was 6573 million a decrease of 73 million from the comparable period in fiscal 2011 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 106 a decrease of 18 basis points due to the deleverage of our sgampa rate partially offset by a slightly higher gross profit rateour inventory balance as of december 29 2012 increased 2655 million or 130 over the prior year driven primarily by our inventory availability initiatives including store upgrades the opening of our new distribution center continued expansion of our hub network and new store growthwe generated operating cash flow of 6853 million during fiscal 2012 a decrease of 173 compared to fiscal 2011 with the largest portion of the decrease consisting of an increase in accounts receivable resulting from the insourcing of our commercial credit programotherin january 2012 we issued 300 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2022 with an interest rate of 450we opened our tenth distribution center in remington in which will provide needed warehouse capacity and upgraded supply chain technologywe insourced our commercial credit function and rolled out our motologic diagnostic and repair resource to support the continued investment in our commercial business subsequent to fiscal 2012 we completed the acquisition of bwp distributors inc a leading commercial provider in the northeastrefer to the results of operations and liquidity sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively business updateour two key strategies superior availability and service leadership remained unchanged in fiscal 2012 and continue to serve as the foundation for all of the initiatives we undertake superior availability is focused on consistently improving product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our local market availability service leadership relies on superior availability and a more consistent execution of serving our diy and commercial customers needs whether in our stores or online through these two key strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the biggest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 38 in fiscal 2012 compared to 37 in fiscal 2011 22table of contentswe believe our current initiatives are key for our longterm sales growth and improvement in our gross profit rate combined with our focus on balancing support and discretionary expenses with the additional cost of investments in our key strategies we are committed to achieving our longerterm growth and profitability goals as we enter fiscal 2013 the key initiatives under our strategies includegrowing our commercial business through improved delivery speed and reliability increased customer retention and increased volume with national and regional accountsimproving localized parts availability through the continued increase in number of hubs strengthened focus on key store availability and leveraging the advancement of our supply chain infrastructureaccelerating our new store growth rate andcontinuing our focus on store execution through more effective scheduling product onhand accuracy sales training and customer engagementacquisitionon december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc bwp a privately held company that supplies markets and distributes automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers bwp operates or supplies 216 locations in the northeastern united states we believe this acquisition will enable us to continue our expansion in the competitive northeast which is a strategic growth area for us due to the large population and overall size of the market and to gain valuable information to apply to our existing operations as a result of bwps expertise in commercial as a result of this transaction we will operate 124 bwp companyowned stores and two distribution centers we will begin integrating the bwp locations in fiscal 2013 automotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continues to impact us and the retail industry in general while we believe that the current macroeconomic environment continues to constrain consumer spending we remain confident that the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry are positive furthermore we continue to believe we are well positioned to serve our customers by meeting their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environmentwe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items historically the longterm trend in miles driven in the us has steadily increased however according to the department of transportation total miles driven in the us remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2011 as the us experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions historically rapid increases in fuel prices have also negatively impacted total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel average gasoline prices increased approximately 25 during this same time frame while gas prices remain somewhat volatile and are not predicted to return to prerecessionary levels gas prices were relatively flat when comparing the average price of gas in 2012 to 2011 and the number of miles driven in 2012 increased approximately 06 as measured through october we believe that as the us economy continues to recover and gasoline prices stabilize further annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industrynumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry there were 241 million vehicles on the road in 2011 which is 15 higher than in 2001 while recent industry data reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia indicates that the growth in number of vehicles on the road has decelerated and new vehicle registrations are increasing the average age of vehicle continues to increase the average age of vehicles has gradually increased over the last five years from 103 years in 2008 to 113 years in 2012 we believe that the average age of vehicles continues to increase due to relatively constant scrappage rates a rate of new car sales well under the 10year trend and an increase in overall quality of vehicles as the average age of a vehicle increases a larger percentage of the 23table of contentsmiles driven are outside of the manufacturer warranty period these outofwarranty older vehicles generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures we believe that consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy slowly recovers contributing to the trend of an aging vehicle population  store development by segmentthe following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2012 2011

sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our ecommerce website our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods

may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements

quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offering as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal yearat december 29 2012 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 5981 million an increase of 5402 million compared to december 31 2011 the end of fiscal 2011 this increase in cash was primarily a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of senior unsecured notes partially offset by investments in property and equipment and net payments on our

our outstanding indebtedness was 6051 million or 1891 million higher when compared to december 31 2011 and consisted of borrowings of 5989 million under our senior unsecured notes and 62 million outstanding on economic development notes additionally we had 788 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility to 6712 million subsequent to year end we used 1882 million of cash on hand to fund the purchase price and related expenses for our acquisition of bwp as discussed earlier in this managements discussion and analysis and more fully in note 22 to our consolidated financial statementscapital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems while we lease the vast majority of our store locations we develop and own a small percentage of new store locations depending on market conditions our capital expenditures were 2712 million in fiscal 2012 an increase of 31 million over fiscal 2011 our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in our existing stores information technology and our supply chain network in fiscal 2013 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2750 million to 3000 million these investments will be primarily driven by new store development leased and owned locations investments in our existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including continued investments in our supply chain network and new systems we anticipate opening 155 to 165 aap stores and 10 to 15 ai stores during fiscal 2013 excluding the 124 bwp stores acquired on december 31 2012 28table of contentsstock

institution to settle credit transactions with our commercial customers to processing those transactions internally benefits we expect to realize include a higher level of service with our commercial customers and having a capability in place to increase the amount of commercial sales on credit while realizing cost savings over the longterm our concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we also mitigate

facility matures on may 27 201630table of contentsas of december 29 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of 788 million which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to 6712 million the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policiesthe interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 15 per annum for each of the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility

redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in each

optionas of december 29 2012 we had a credit rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet arrangements as of december 29 2012 we had no offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit

notes and 450 notes which become due in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2022 respectively2 we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a

longterm portion of deferred income taxes selfinsurance liabilities unrecognized income tax benefits closed store liabilities and obligations for employee benefit plans for which no contractual

table4 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancelation penalty under the agreement our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above tablecritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold32table of contents cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1030 million and 827 million at december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 29 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 64 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were 314 million 308 million and 182 million respectivelyshrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve while our shrink expense increased in fiscal 2011 from a loss of inventory as determined by the completion of physical inventories in our stores our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 40 basis points over the last three years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the yearour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 29 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 20 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012 warranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an 33table of contentsobligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 29 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 24 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were 945 million 989 million and 971 million respectively historically our total selfinsurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles in fiscal 2012 we experienced a reduction in our selfinsurance reserves primarily due to a drop in severity of medical claims and favorable claims development related to our workers compensation claims our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle effective january 1 2011 we classified 503 million of our selfinsurance liability as longterm because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 29 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 59 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012goodwill and intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth we have allocated our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within each of our reportable segments to multiple reporting units in our aap segment and to the entire ai segment respectively during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 34table of contentsincome tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 29 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 17 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012new accounting pronouncementsfor a description of recently announced accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see new accounting pronouncements in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form 10kitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedgesfrom september 2011 through january 2012 we executed a series of forward treasury rate locks in anticipation of the issuance of the 2022 notes the treasury rate locks which are derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges to offset our exposure to increases in the underlying us treasury benchmark rate this rate was used to establish the fixed interest rate for our 2022 notes which was comprised of the underlying us treasury benchmark rate plus a credit spread premium upon issuance of the 2022 notes the cumulative change in fair market value of the treasury rate locks was not significant due to the narrow margin between the lock rate and the underlying treasury rate the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at the companys option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin at december 29 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or an alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 notes or 2022 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 and 450 respectively per annumcredit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses35table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary

the accounts of advance and its wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimatescash cash equivalents and bank overdrafts cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less included in cash equivalents are credit card and debit card receivables from banks which generally settle within two to four business days credit and debit card receivables included in cash and cash equivalents at december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 were

initiative consisted of the transition from using a third party financial institution to settle credit transactions with its commercial customers to processing those transactions internally thus increasing the trade receivable balance during the current year the companys concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited because the companys customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base the company also mitigates its exposure to credit risk through a credit approval process including credit checks predetermined credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures  inventoryinventory amounts are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost of the companys merchandise inventory is determined using the lastin firstout lifo method under the lifo method the companys cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories

incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue

for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as the company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes the company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management the reevaluations are based on many factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law successfully settled issues under audit expirations due to statutes of limitations and new federal or state audit activity any change in either the companys recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual the company also follows guidance provided on derecognition of benefits classification interest and penalties accounting in interim

underlying transaction and the probability that the underlying transaction will occur for derivatives with cash flow hedge designation the company reports the aftertax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other income loss and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and within the

is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable as facts concerning contingencies become known to the company the company reassesses its position with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates that are particularly sensitive to future change include legal matters which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process  the companys western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products the company and some of its other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants these products have primarily included brake parts many of the cases pending against the company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants although the company diligently defends against these claims the company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interests of the companys shareholders the company believes that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date the company does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results financial position or liquidity however if the company were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and was ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse affect on its operating results financial position and liquidity historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in type and number and have been immaterial as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company in the future if the number of claims filed against the company or any of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on its operating results financial position or liquidity in future periods the company is involved in various types of legal proceedings arising from claims of employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by current and former team members the damages claimed against the company in some of these proceedings are substantial because of the uncertainty of the outcome of such legal matters and because the companys liability if any could vary widely including the size of any damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any negotiated settlement the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise the company is also involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined based on the facts presently known it is managements opinion that the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity17benefit plans401k plan the company maintains a defined contribution benefit plan
