stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our productsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both commercial and diy customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts our vendors because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected our reputation and our brands because our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity it could reduce demand for our products the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our commercial and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesaler distributors iv jobber stores v independentlyowned stores vi automobile dealers that supply parts and vii internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more lucrative store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable  10table of contentswe may not be able to successfully integrate gpis operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant transaction and integration costs our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and we may not be able to retain key gpi personnelintegration issues and business expectationswe cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpis operations with ours this integration may be complex and failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investorsthe acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding gpis and our businesses including affecting gpis and our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on gpis and our businesses financial results and operations in particular gpi and advance could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsin connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification periodadditional transaction and integration costsin connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant onetime transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all level of indebtednessin connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes associated with the acquisition of gpiin addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 11table of contentsretention of key gpi personnelthe success of the integration with gpi will depend in part on the ability to retain key gpi employees who are expected to continue employment with the combined company if any of these employees decide not to remain with the combined company it is possible we may be unable to locate suitable replacements for such key employees or to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms in addition if key employees terminate their employment managements attention might be diverted from successfully integrating gpis operations to hiring suitable replacements and the combined companys business might suffer we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2652 stores at the end of our 2004 fiscal year to 5372 stores as of january 3 2015 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team memberswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets  12table of contentssupply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standardsif our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members as of february 26 2015 we employed 73000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit  13table of contentsour overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at relatively high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate payroll taxes increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 and many consumers are now facing increased healthcare costs as a result of the recently enacted affordable care act this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and elective maintenance needed to be completed impact on operating costsrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some

were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the pending cases against us and our subsidiaries are in early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows

which is described further in the section entitled reconciliation of nongaap financial measures introductionwe are the largest automotive aftermarket parts provider in north america serving both doitforme or commercial and doityourself or diy customers as of january 3 2015 we operated a total of 5261 stores and 111 distribution branches we operated primarily within the united states with additional locations in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our stores operate primarily under trade names advance auto parts autopart international and carquest and our distribution branches operate under the worldpac trade name in addition we served approximately 1325 independentlyowned carquest stores as of january 3 2015 we acquired the carquest and worldpac operations as part of our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name oem and private label automotive replacement parts accessories batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars vans sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our commercial and diy customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom wwwcarquestcom and wwwworldpaccom our diy customers can elect to pick up merchandise ordered online at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online management overview we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 671 during 2014 compared to 532 for 2013 the increase in our diluted eps was driven primarily by the acquired gpi operations a 20 increase in comparable store sales and an additional week of operations in 2014 when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable earnings per diluted share comparable cash eps was 759061 of gpi integration expenses036 of amortization

comparable cash eps was 776 our diluted eps for 2013 included 027 of transaction expenses related to our acquisition of gpi and 008 of expenses associated with our integration of bwp during 2014 we generated a comparable store sales increase of 20 this increase was driven by consistent strength in commercial sales throughout the year with increases in both customer traffic and average ticket for the year we are beginning to realize the benefits from the investments we have made to better serve our commercial customers including but not limited to additional availability of inventory from one of our 421 hub stores daily replenishment in certain markets and rollout of crosssourcing of inventory throughout a majority of our enterprise integration of eservice offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores and increased focus on national and regional accounts our diy sales were not as consistent as  22table of contentscommercial in 2014 sales of seasonal and maintenance parts categories fluctuated more than anticipated in many of our markets due to the cooler summer and warmer start to the winter selling season acquisitionson january 2 2014 we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion gpi formerly a privatelyheld company is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233 carquest stores and 103 worldpac branches located in 45 states and canada and served approximately 1400 independentlyowned carquest stores we believe the acquisition of gpi will allow us to expand our geographic presence commercial capabilities and overall scale to better serve customers for additional information on the gpi acquisition refer to note 4 acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statementson december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwps rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2014 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operations2014 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our 2014 includefinancialtotal sales during 2014 increased 516 to 98439 million as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of gpi a comparable store sales increase of 20 1504 million in sales from the 53rd week and sales from new stores opened during the past year our operating income for 2014 was 8517 million an increase of 1914 million from the comparable period in 2013 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 87 a decrease of 152 basis points due to a lower gross profit rate partially offset by a favorable sgampa rate our inventory balance as of january 3 2015 increased 13804 million or 540 over the prior year driven primarily by the acquisition of gpi as well as inventory upgrades and increases from new stores and hub storeswe generated operating cash flow of 7090 million during 2014 an increase of 300 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net income and noncash expensesrefer to the consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively business update we have two essential priorities  i deliver results by executing under our key strategies of superior availability and service leadership and ii successfully achieve the goals of the multiyear gpi integration plan our key strategies remain consistent with 2014 superior availability is aimed at product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution of customerfacing initiatives to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our customers in our stores and online through these two key strategies and the integration of gpi we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below to produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the largest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 570 in 2014 compared to 404 in 2013 this increase is primarily due to the contribution of the acquired gpi and bwp operations which are significantly more heavily weighted in commercial than our advance auto parts stores in addition our comparable store sales growth has been driven primarily by sales to commercial customers 23table of contentsour strategic priorities includegrowing our commercial business through improved delivery speed and reliability increased customer retention increased volume with national and regional accounts and the integration of gpiimproving localized parts availability through the continued increase in the number of our larger hub stores an increased focus on instore availability enabled by rolling out a second source network between store brands and leveraging the advancement of our supply chain infrastructure including the opening of our hartford ct distribution center and gradually expanding to other distribution centersmaintaining a steady new store growth rate including new markets andcontinuing our focus on store execution through more effective scheduling increased productivity and simplification improved product onhand accuracy expanded sales training and continued measurement of customer satisfactionwe are pleased with the first year results of our multiyear gpi integration plan our plan is to fully integrate the carquest owned stores and overall operations into advance auto parts over the next few years and to integrate the availability of all of our product offerings throughout the entire chain we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies during 2014 our focus was on team member retention achievement of initial cost savings and synergies improvement of inventory availability including the rollout of crosssourcing with worldpac and carquest and leveraging our differentiated customer programs during 2015 our priorities in the integration plan will includecontinuing to integrate the two organizations into a single structuresuccessfully executing the product and brand changeoverscontinuing with store consolidations and ramping up store conversions by market andintegrating our critical customer capabilities within supply chain and information technologyautomotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position the industry favorably in 2015 as a steadily improving job market along with lower fuel costs should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven showing improvement as a result we expect to see a decrease in deferred maintenance over timewe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased slightly by 14 in 2014 which was a significant improvement from the 01 increase in 2013 due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices industry data suggests that the increase in miles driven will likely remain under prerecession levels due to pressure from a lower labor force participation rate and less vehicle usage by the most recent generation of drivers while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic pressures on our consumers we believe the return of increases in miles driven will continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industrynumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures since the recession low of 248 million vehicles in 2011 the number of vehicles on the road has increased over the last three years according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 261 million vehicles by 2017 the overall mix of vehicles on the road is beginning to shift as a result of the increased rate of new car sales the percentage of vehicles that are 6 to 11 years old is  24table of contentsexpected to decline and the percentage of vehicles that are new to five years old is expected to increase this will slow the growth of average vehicle age which increased from 103 years in 2009 to 114 years in 2013 however we believe that the stabilization of average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longer term as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts  store developmentwe serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store development activity for the year ended

and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict our liquidity needs for our domestic operationsas of january 3 2015 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1047 million a decrease of 10078 million compared to december 28 2013 this decrease in cash was primarily a result of cash used in the acquisition of gpi partially offset by cash generated from operations and net borrowings under credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2014 activity to 2013 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of january 3 2015 our outstanding indebtedness was 16369 million or 5833 million higher when compared to december 28 2013 as a result of additional borrowings of 4900 million under our term loan and 934 million under our credit facility additionally we had 1243 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 7823 million as of january 3 2015 the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies gpi acquisition and exit activitieswe borrowed 10060 million under a term loan and revolving credit facility which we used along with cash onhand to fund the 208 billion acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the normal operations of gpi we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies during 2014 we incurred 732 million of gpi integration expenses partially offset by 610 million of synergiescapital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and information technology we lease approximately 85 of our stores our capital expenditures were 2284 million in 2014 an increase of 327 million from 2013 in addition to routine capital expenditures our capital investments during 2014 included the acquisition of gpi and nine independent stores for 20608 million net of cash acquiredour future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi  30table of contentsin 2015 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 325 million to 340 million these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and systems we anticipate opening between 100 to 120 stores and branches during 2015 stock repurchaseswe have a stock repurchase program that

activities increased 1637 million to 7090 million this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both carquest and advance auto parts for 2013 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1400 million to 5453 million this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a 2063 million increase in inventory net of accounts payable primarily due to an increase in inventory related to new stores and other inventory availability initiatives combined with the deceleration in our accounts payable ratio partially offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a 571 million decrease in the outflow of cash related to receivables resulting from the transition of our inhouse commercial credit program in 2012 and a 224 million increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payments

we had a credit rating from standard amp poors of bbb and from moodys investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet arrangements we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 336 million as of january 3 2015 these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very

inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table 34table of contentscritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment acquisition impactswe acquired gpi on january 2 2014 the process of integrating gpi with aap has begun and we expect the integration to continue for a few years we have used various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including using a market participant perspective when applying certain generally accepted valuation techniques supplemented with market appraisals where appropriate significant judgments and estimates were required in preparing these fair value estimates final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans accordingly critical accounting policies and estimates such as but not limited to inventory valuationobsolescence asset impairments goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes may have additional acquisitionrelated impacts beyond what is described in the following respective critical accounting policiesgoodwill and intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 3 2015 the vast majority of our goodwill balance was allocated to three of our five reporting units our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firmwe determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sgampa rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates the carrying value of goodwill was 9954 million and 1998 million at january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectively the increase to goodwill in 2014 was primarily due to our acquisition of gpi and has been allocated between our carquest and worldpac reporting units for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units and therefore no impairment existed the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our recently acquired reporting units may not be indicative of the total company because there have been no significant changes in valuation assumptions since the acquisition date we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  35table of contentsin evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 16 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 494 million 375 million and 314 million respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the reported inventory reserves properly exclude any adjustments made to establish the fair value of gpis opening inventory balance shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 20 basis points over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the yearour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 31 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015 selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 1370 million 985 million and 945 million respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three years due to favorable claims development partially offset by the impact of our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles 36table of contentsour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 87 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is soldcooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1798 million and 1113 million as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 114 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015warranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 30 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015 37table of contentsnew accounting pronouncementsfor a description of recently announced accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see new accounting pronouncements in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form 10kitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of january 3 2015 the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 3 2015 we had 934 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and 4900 million outstanding under our term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annumthe table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan outstanding at january 3 2015 by expected maturity dates weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 3 2015 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 thereafter total fairmarketliability dollars in thousandsvariable rate  35000 163400 385000  583400 583400weighted average interest rate19 28 35 38 40 41 30 credit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit lossesforeign currency exchange rate riskalthough we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our consolidated operations in addition some of the companys inventory purchases are denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility of these products as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices we have not historically had significant foreign currency exchange gains and losses 38table of contentsitem 8 financial statements and supplementary data see financial

recognizes tax benefits andor tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as the company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes the company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management the reevaluations are based on many factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law successfully settled issues under audit

estimates that are particularly sensitive to future change include legal matters which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process  the companys western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including but not limited to automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products the company and some of its other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many asbestosrelated lawsuits the automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts the plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the cases pending against the company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although the company and its subsidiaries diligently defend against these claims the company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interests of the companys shareholders the company believes that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date the company does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results financial position or liquidity however if the company andor a subsidiary were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and was ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on its operating results financial position and liquidity historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and the companys liability if any could vary widely as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company or any subsidiary in the future if the number of claims filed against the company or any of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on its operating results financial position or liquidity in future periods the company is involved in various types of legal proceedings arising from claims of employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by current and former team members the damages claimed against the company in some of these proceedings are substantial because of the uncertainty of the outcome of such legal matters and because the companys liability if any could vary widely including the size of any damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any negotiated settlement the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise the company is also involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined based on the facts presently known it is managements opinion that the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity18 benefit plans401k plan the
