with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our commercial and diy salesteam members as of february 26 2015 we employed approximately 41600 fulltime team members and

of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa oreilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe amp jack and uniselect inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store locationenvironmental matters we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendorswe own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to dateitem 1a risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price  9table of contentsoverall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including the number and average age of vehicles being driven because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our productsthe economy because during periods of declining economic conditions both commercial and diy customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new carsthe weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts our vendors because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected our reputation and our brands because our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity it could reduce demand for our products the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected andthe refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our commercial and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networkif any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesaler distributors iv jobber stores v independentlyowned stores vi automobile dealers that supply parts and vii internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more lucrative store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable  10table of contentswe may not be able to successfully integrate gpis operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to

extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investorsthe acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding gpis and our businesses including affecting gpis and our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on gpis and our businesses financial results and operations in particular gpi and advance could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsin connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification periodadditional transaction and integration costsin connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant onetime transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all level of indebtednessin connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other thingsaffect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costlyrequire us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitionslimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we competeplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtednessrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions andmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the notes associated with the acquisition of gpiin addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 11table of contentsretention of key gpi personnelthe success of the integration with gpi will depend in part on the ability to retain key gpi employees who are expected to continue employment with the combined company if any of these employees decide not to remain with the combined company it is possible we may be unable to locate suitable replacements for such key employees or to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms in addition if key employees terminate their employment managements attention might be diverted from successfully integrating gpis operations to hiring suitable replacements and the combined companys business might suffer we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share andour ability to continue our commercial sales growthfor that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2652 stores at the end of our 2004 fiscal year to 5372 stores as of january 3 2015 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other thingsthe availability of desirable store locations the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locationsthe availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates andour ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team memberswe are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets  12table of contentssupply chainour store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standardsif our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customerswe depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members as of february 26 2015 we employed 73000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigationthe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our businessdeterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy pricesimpact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratingssignificant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit  13table of contentsour overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows impact on our suppliersour business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them impact on our customersdeterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at relatively high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate payroll taxes increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 and many consumers are now facing increased healthcare costs as a result of the recently enacted affordable care act this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and elective maintenance needed to be completed impact on operating costsrising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costsbecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations  14table of contentswe work
