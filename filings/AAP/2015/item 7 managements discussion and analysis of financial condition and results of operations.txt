statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the sections entitled forwardlooking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this reportour fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31st of each year which results in an extra week every several years fiscal 2014 contained 53 weeks our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53week fiscal year in 2014 our last 53week fiscal year was in 2008 unless otherwise noted our financial results have been presented on a gaap basis in limited instances we have presented our financial results on a gaap and nongaap comparable basis which is described further in the section entitled reconciliation of nongaap financial measures introductionwe are the largest automotive aftermarket parts provider in north america serving both doitforme or commercial and doityourself or diy customers as of january 3 2015 we operated a total of 5261 stores and 111 distribution branches we operated primarily within the united states with additional locations in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our stores operate primarily under trade names advance auto parts autopart international and carquest and our distribution branches operate under the worldpac trade name in addition we served approximately 1325 independentlyowned carquest stores as of january 3 2015 we acquired the carquest and worldpac operations as part of our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name oem and private label automotive replacement parts accessories batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars vans sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our commercial and diy customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom wwwcarquestcom and wwwworldpaccom our diy customers can elect to pick up merchandise ordered online at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online management overview we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 671 during 2014 compared to 532 for 2013 the increase in our diluted eps was driven primarily by the acquired gpi operations a 20 increase in comparable store sales and an additional week of operations in 2014 when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable earnings per diluted share comparable cash eps was 759061 of gpi integration expenses036 of amortization related to the acquired intangible assets from gpi008 of bwp integration expenses and017 from the 53rd week partially offsetting the above expenseswhen including the results of the 53rd week our comparable cash eps was 776 our diluted eps for 2013 included 027 of transaction expenses related to our acquisition of gpi and 008 of expenses associated with our integration of bwp during 2014 we generated a comparable store sales increase of 20 this increase was driven by consistent strength in commercial sales throughout the year with increases in both customer traffic and average ticket for the year we are beginning to realize the benefits from the investments we have made to better serve our commercial customers including but not limited to additional availability of inventory from one of our 421 hub stores daily replenishment in certain markets and rollout of crosssourcing of inventory throughout a majority of our enterprise integration of eservice offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores and increased focus on national and regional accounts our diy sales were not as consistent as  22table of contentscommercial in 2014 sales of seasonal and maintenance parts categories fluctuated more than anticipated in many of our markets due to the cooler summer and warmer start to the winter selling season acquisitionson january 2 2014 we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion gpi formerly a privatelyheld company is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233 carquest stores and 103 worldpac branches located in 45 states and canada and served approximately 1400 independentlyowned carquest stores we believe the acquisition of gpi will allow us to expand our geographic presence commercial capabilities and overall scale to better serve customers for additional information on the gpi acquisition refer to note 4 acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statementson december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwps rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2014 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operations2014 highlightsa highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our 2014 includefinancialtotal sales during 2014 increased 516 to 98439 million as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of gpi a comparable store sales increase of 20 1504 million in sales from the 53rd week and sales from new stores opened during the past year our operating income for 2014 was 8517 million an increase of 1914 million from the comparable period in 2013 as a percentage of total sales operating income was 87 a decrease of 152 basis points due to a lower gross profit rate partially offset by a favorable sgampa rate our inventory balance as of january 3 2015 increased 13804 million or 540 over the prior year driven primarily by the acquisition of gpi as well as inventory upgrades and increases from new stores and hub storeswe generated operating cash flow of 7090 million during 2014 an increase of 300 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net income and noncash expensesrefer to the consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively business update we have two essential priorities  i deliver results by executing under our key strategies of superior availability and service leadership and ii successfully achieve the goals of the multiyear gpi integration plan our key strategies remain consistent with 2014 superior availability is aimed at product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution of customerfacing initiatives to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our customers in our stores and online through these two key strategies and the integration of gpi we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below to produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the largest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 570 in 2014 compared to 404 in 2013 this increase is primarily due to the contribution of the acquired gpi and bwp operations which are significantly more heavily weighted in commercial than our advance auto parts stores in addition our comparable store sales growth has been driven primarily by sales to commercial customers 23table of contentsour strategic priorities includegrowing our commercial business through improved delivery speed and reliability increased customer retention increased volume with national and regional accounts and the integration of gpiimproving localized parts availability through the continued increase in the number of our larger hub stores an increased focus on instore availability enabled by rolling out a second source network between store brands and leveraging the advancement of our supply chain infrastructure including the opening of our hartford ct distribution center and gradually expanding to other distribution centersmaintaining a steady new store growth rate including new markets andcontinuing our focus on store execution through more effective scheduling increased productivity and simplification improved product onhand accuracy expanded sales training and continued measurement of customer satisfactionwe are pleased with the first year results of our multiyear gpi integration plan our plan is to fully integrate the carquest owned stores and overall operations into advance auto parts over the next few years and to integrate the availability of all of our product offerings throughout the entire chain we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies during 2014 our focus was on team member retention achievement of initial cost savings and synergies improvement of inventory availability including the rollout of crosssourcing with worldpac and carquest and leveraging our differentiated customer programs during 2015 our priorities in the integration plan will includecontinuing to integrate the two organizations into a single structuresuccessfully executing the product and brand changeoverscontinuing with store consolidations and ramping up store conversions by market andintegrating our critical customer capabilities within supply chain and information technologyautomotive aftermarket industryoperating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position the industry favorably in 2015 as a steadily improving job market along with lower fuel costs should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven showing improvement as a result we expect to see a decrease in deferred maintenance over timewe believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the roadmiles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased slightly by 14 in 2014 which was a significant improvement from the 01 increase in 2013 due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices industry data suggests that the increase in miles driven will likely remain under prerecession levels due to pressure from a lower labor force participation rate and less vehicle usage by the most recent generation of drivers while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic pressures on our consumers we believe the return of increases in miles driven will continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industrynumber of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle agewe believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures since the recession low of 248 million vehicles in 2011 the number of vehicles on the road has increased over the last three years according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 261 million vehicles by 2017 the overall mix of vehicles on the road is beginning to shift as a result of the increased rate of new car sales the percentage of vehicles that are 6 to 11 years old is  24table of contentsexpected to decline and the percentage of vehicles that are new to five years old is expected to increase this will slow the growth of average vehicle age which increased from 103 years in 2009 to 114 years in 2013 however we believe that the stabilization of average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longer term as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts  store developmentwe serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store development activity for the year ended january 3 2015 including the consolidation of stores as part

capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict our liquidity needs for our domestic operationsas of january 3 2015 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1047 million a decrease of 10078 million compared to december 28 2013 this decrease in cash was primarily a result of cash used in the acquisition of gpi partially offset by cash generated from operations and net borrowings under credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2014 activity to 2013 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section as of january 3 2015 our outstanding indebtedness was 16369 million or 5833 million higher when compared to december 28 2013 as a result of additional borrowings of 4900 million under our term loan and 934 million under our credit facility additionally we had 1243 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 7823 million as of january 3 2015 the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies gpi acquisition and exit activitieswe borrowed 10060 million under a term loan and revolving credit facility which we used along with cash onhand to fund the 208 billion acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the normal operations of gpi we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies during 2014 we incurred 732 million of gpi integration expenses partially offset by 610 million of synergiescapital expendituresour primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and information technology we lease approximately 85 of our stores our capital expenditures were 2284 million in 2014 an increase of 327 million from 2013 in addition to routine capital expenditures our capital investments during 2014 included the acquisition of gpi and nine independent stores for 20608 million net of cash acquiredour future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi  30table of contentsin 2015 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 325 million to 340 million these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and

increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both carquest and advance auto parts for 2013 net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1400 million to 5453 million this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a 2063 million increase in inventory net of accounts payable primarily due to an increase in inventory related to new stores and other inventory availability initiatives combined with the deceleration in our accounts payable ratio partially offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a 571 million decrease in the outflow of cash related to receivables resulting from the transition of our inhouse commercial credit program in 2012 and a 224 million increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payments to vendorsinvesting activitiesfor 2014 net cash used in

of baa3 the current outlooks by standard amp poors and moodys are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decreaseoffbalancesheet arrangements we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 336 million as of january 3 2015 these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of january 3 2015 we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in

we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table 34table of contentscritical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment acquisition impactswe acquired gpi on january 2 2014 the process of integrating gpi with aap has begun and we expect the integration to continue for a few years we have used various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including using a market participant perspective when applying certain generally accepted valuation techniques supplemented with market appraisals where appropriate significant judgments and estimates were required in preparing these fair value estimates final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans accordingly critical accounting policies and estimates such as but not limited to inventory valuationobsolescence asset impairments goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes may have additional acquisitionrelated impacts beyond what is described in the following respective critical accounting policiesgoodwill and intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 3 2015 the vast majority of our goodwill balance was allocated to three of our five reporting units our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firmwe determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sgampa rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates the carrying value of goodwill was 9954 million and 1998 million at january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectively the increase to goodwill in 2014 was primarily due to our acquisition of gpi and has been allocated between our carquest and worldpac reporting units for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units and therefore no impairment existed the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our recently acquired reporting units may not be indicative of the total company because there have been no significant changes in valuation assumptions since the acquisition date we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material income tax reservesthe determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  35table of contentsin evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 16 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 494 million 375 million and 314 million respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the reported inventory reserves properly exclude any adjustments made to establish the fair value of gpis opening inventory balance shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 20 basis points over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the yearour inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 31 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015 selfinsurance reserveswe are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 1370 million 985 million and 945 million respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three years due to favorable claims development partially offset by the impact of our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles 36table of contentsour selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilitieswhile we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sgampa could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 87 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sgampa are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is soldcooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sgampa when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1798 million and 1113 million as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectivelysimilarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreementsamounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 114 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015warranty reserveswe offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of salesa 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 3 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 30 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015 37table of contentsnew accounting pronouncementsfor a
