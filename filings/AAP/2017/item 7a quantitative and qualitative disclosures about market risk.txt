s interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances and have designated these hedges as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2016 the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 31 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or term loan however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annumcredit riskour financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit lossesforeign currency exchange rate riskour primary foreign currency exposure arises from our canadian operations and the translation of canadian dollar denominated revenues profits and net assets into us dollars during 2016 the translation of the operating results of our canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income we view our investments in the canadian subsidiaries as longterm and any changes in our net assets in the canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of the companys inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances we believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices gains from foreign currency transactions which are included in other income net were 07 million during 2016
