the acquisitions of cameron health inc bridgepoint medical inc rhythmia medical inc and vessix vascular inc all discussed above there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 886 million on research and development in 2012 895 million in 2011 and 939 million in 2010 representing approximately 12 percent of our net sales each year our investment in research and development reflectsregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts which incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration productswe have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we expect will enhance our overall efficiency and effectiveness our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer innovative and manufacturable products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts8table of contentsmarketing and salesduring 2012 we marketed our products to over 13000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in nearly 100 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence we are not dependent on any single institution and no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2012 or 2011 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focusing on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 net sales and operating income attributable to our 2012 geographic regions are presented in note o  segment reporting to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report incorporated by reference herein our international structure operates through three international business units emea consisting of europe the middle east and africa japan and intercontinental consisting of our asia pacific and the americas reporting units maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth plan through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce new products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countries a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations is included in item 1a of this annual reportas of december 31 2012 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 59 percent of our products sold worldwide during 2012 were manufactured at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland as well as physician training centers in france and japanmanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization by shifting global manufacturing along product lines we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality and reliability service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectivenessour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in our manufacture of products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs 9table of contentsin certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner which could have an adverse impact on our operationspursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules may impose additional costs on us including for diligence as to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as for any resulting changes we make to products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could have an adverse effect on the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our productsquality assurancewe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented updated quality systems and concepts throughout our organization our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities including our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationin addition we maintain an ongoing initiative to seek iso14001 certification at our plants around the world iso14001 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business we engage in continuous environmental performance improvement efforts and at present as it relates to our major manufacturing and tier 1 distribution facilities 13 of our 14 facilities have attained iso14001 certification we are committed to achieving iso14001 certification at all of our major manufacturing facilities and tier i distribution centers worldwidecompetitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc and st jude medical inc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productswe believe that our products compete primarily on their ability to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as clinical outcomes ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products with differentiated clinical outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technology apply our technology costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand10table of contentsregulatory environmentthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr this process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw before we can launch new products in japan the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local data in addition to global data 11table of contentswhile harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurewe are also subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers shareholders and employees we are committed to continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policiesgovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad of legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration office state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare reform political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective treatments although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant in addition uncertainty remains regarding the continued implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act aca and its impact to our businessfurther the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to hcps licensed by certain states on the federal level we are required to begin tracking financial relationships in august 2013 and reporting by the end of the first quarter of 2014 we have devoted substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes in order to comply with these us federal and state legal and regulatory requirements in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations additionally new legislation imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 thirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients12table of contentswe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos begin to take shape in the united states initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in many countries in which we do business implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products and may influence a physicians selection of products used to treat patientsin addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesthirdparty payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement by payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by thirdparty payors that reimbursement will be available or if available that the thirdparty payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2012 we held more than 15000 patents and had approximately 7300 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledgethere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties 13table of contentswe maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm

the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework in the areas of strategic risk financial risk external risk operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management provides increased visibility into the risks we face highlights risk interdependencies and seeks to improve overall risk management effectiveness current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payorsemployeesas of december 31 2012 we had approximately 24000 employees including approximately 12000 in operations 6000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 2000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 10000 outside the us approximately 7000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreachwe are committed to making more possible in the communities where we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our close the gap program which aims to eliminate cardiovascular care disparities by helping to ensure all patients  regardless of age gender race ethnicity or primary language  receive access to optimal cardiac care to achieve this goal close the gap provides awareness to the community about cardiovascular risk factors teaches healthcare providers about cultural beliefs and barriers to treatment and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the cardiovascular care they need by sponsoring programs and working via partnerships in the community our close the gap program has helped these messages reach over one million peoplethrough the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly with regards to science technology engineering and math stem education boston scientific has committed to contributing 15 million to our close the gap program and stem education14table of contentsseasonalityour worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however customer purchases have historically been lighter in the third quarter of the

considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of item 1 of this annual report additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operationsdeclines in average selling prices for our products particularly our drugeluting coronary stent systems may materially adversely affect our results of operationswe have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payors competitive pricing pressures have particularly affected our drugeluting coronary stent system offerings we estimate that the average selling price of our drugeluting stent systems in the us decreased seven percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year continued declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drugeluting coronary stent systems and crm products declines in market size average selling prices procedural volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete increased competition market perceptions of studies published by third parties or product launch delays may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including potential future writeoffs of our goodwill and other intangible assets balancesnet sales from drugeluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2012 in 2012 lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and declines in procedural volumes resulted in a decline in our share of the us drugeluting stent market as well as an overall decrease in the size of the market there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets that we will regain or gain share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets or that the size of the us drugeluting stent market will reach previous levels or will not decline further all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse impact on our results of operationsnet sales from our crm group represented approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012 our crm net sales declined in 2012 primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market further physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants the us department of justice investigation into hospitals icd implant practices the expansion of medicare recovery audits and ongoing physician alignment to hospitals have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the size of the crm market our us icd sales represented approximately 45 percent of our worldwide crm net sales in 2012 and any changes in this market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations there can be no assurance that the size of the crm market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to increase crm market share or increase net sales in a timely manner if at all decreases in market size or our share of the crm market and decreases in net sales from our crm products could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in addition our inability to increase our worldwide crm net sales could result in future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges further variability in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges or may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operationsconsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry including hospitals 19table of contentsthis consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers there can be no assurance that measures we may take to address these trends will succeed we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors which may continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operationswe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc and st jude medical inc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productsadditionally the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change developments by other companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsbecause we derive a significant amount of our net sales from international operations and a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations including from emerging markets changes in international economic or regulatory conditions could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operationssales outside the us accounted for approximately 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 additionally a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations including from our increased sales presence and other investments in emerging markets such as brazil russia china and india we recently created a new asiapacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region sales practices in certain international markets however may be inconsistent with our desired business practices and us legal requirements which may impact our ability to expand as planned in addition we continue to invest in infrastructure in brazil china and india including the development of a world class training center for healthcare providers and invest in local research and development and clinical studies however risks and uncertainties related to political and economic conditions in these regions traditional business practices foreign currency fluctuations interest rate fluctuations regulatory and reimbursement approvals competitive offerings infrastructure development complications and intellectual property protection may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected further international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs and certain international markets may also be impacted by foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries which could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to harmonize reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products most international jurisdictions have regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices and countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices may adopt such requirements we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions in addition the trend in countries around the world toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause us and other medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty delay risk and expense we expect the international regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions which may have a material impact on our business20table of contentsfurther any significant changes in the competitive political legal regulatory reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operationsas part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital our outstanding debt balance was at 4256 billion as of december 31 2012 and 4261 billion as of december 31 2011 in february 2012 moodys investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa3 an investmentgrade rating and in july 2011 fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb an investmentgrade rating in addition standard amp poors ratings services has maintained an investmentgrade corporate credit rating for us since 2009 we believe these ratings reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows the reduction of our debt and our improved financial fundamentals our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies however could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations in addition our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios if we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demandwe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our business or regional reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2012 we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for our europe middle east and africa emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we concluded that the goodwill within the emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a noncash 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally as of december 31 2012 are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period21table of contentson a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for our reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill we also monitor quarterly for events or other potential indicators of impairment that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets for each of these assets relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully or effectively manage the separation activities relating to the divestiture of our neurovascular business could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsas part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we completed several acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 in our strategic growth areas and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the strength of the acquired companies underlying technology and ability to execute results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the futurein addition we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation in january 2011 the divestiture of this business continues to involve a number of risks including the diversion of management and employee attention and unexpected costs and delays including with respect to the transfer of certain manufacturing facilities that we expect to occur during 2013 in addition we are providing postclosing services through a transition services agreement and are also manufacturing and supplying products to stryker these transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in 2013 our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operationswe may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologiesour strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business these acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth the success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors includingour ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at allour ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at allwhether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all andintellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or naturewe may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expense and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequencesin january 2013 we announced an expansion of our 2011 restructuring plan the expansion which is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments which we expect to increase stockholder value key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities relocate select administrative and functional activities rationalize organizational reporting structures expand shared services and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions in addition they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 22table of contentsfurther in february 2010 we announced a 2010 restructuring plan designed to strengthen and position us for longterm success key activities under the 2010 restructuring plan included the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions the realignment of our international structure and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio additionally in january 2009 we announced our plant network optimization program aimed at simplifying our plant network reducing our manufacturing costs and improving gross margins activities under our 2010 restructuring plan were completed in 2012 and our plant network optimization program was substantially completed in 2012 cost reduction initiatives under these collective plans include various cost and efficiency improvement measures which may include headcount reductions the relocation of certain resources as well as administrative and functional activities the closure of certain facilities the transfer of certain production lines the sale of certain nonstrategic assets and other efforts to streamline our business among other actions these measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and reduced employee productivity we may be unable to attract or retain key personnel attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations in addition headcount reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation which could result in substantial cost moreover our expense reduction programs result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that these measures or other expense reduction measures we take in the future will result in the expected cost savingscurrent domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operationsthe continued global financial uncertainty including the european sovereign debt crisis has caused disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy and the strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown and european sovereign debt crisis may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors in addition current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products further our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all for example our net sales have been adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes due to unemployment levels and other economic factors and these reductions may continue in addition the european sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain southern european countries third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding within italy spain and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels while we are pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region there can be no assurances that we will be able to mitigate our risk of further reductions in cash flow in this region in addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may also adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes healthcare policy changes including recently passed healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowspolitical economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and alternative payment models are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective treatments our strategic initiatives include measures to address this trend however there can be no assurance that any of our strategic measures will successfully address this trendthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted into law in the us in march 2010 as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the us this healthcare reform law will materially impact us certain provisions of the law will not be effective until 2014 and 2015 and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood however on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the laws mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance but rejected specific provisions that would have penalized states that did not expand their current medicaid programs as a result of this ruling and other factors we expect implementation of most of the major provisions of the law to continue as currently enacted the law imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of 23table of contentsclass i ii and iii medical devices beginning in 2013 us net sales represented approximately 50 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2012 and therefore this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows other provisions of this law as currently enacted including comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations further we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally however any changes that lower reimbursements for our products reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or other participants in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business and results of operationshealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of thirdparty payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payors further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the us japan or other international countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsmajor thirdparty payors for hospital services in the us and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed has led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the us and has shifted services between inpatient and outpatient settings initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in several countries in which we do business hospitals or physicians may respond to these costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our productswe are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved productsour products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies under the fdc act medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the us in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity the process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products couldtake a significant period of timerequire the expenditure of substantial resourcesinvolve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillancerequire changes to products andresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products24table of contents in addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products recertifications or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirementsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local data in addition to global data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurethe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the fdc act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change we cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution we may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies the failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products including those of our cardiovascular businesses are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsas a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospectsour future growth is dependent upon the development of new products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which are very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable productsin order to develop new products and improve current product offerings we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses if we are unable to develop and launch products as anticipated our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions involving opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas expanding our focus beyond our current businesses is expensive and timeconsuming further there can be no assurance that we will be able to access these 25table of contentstechnologies on terms favorable to us or that these technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance a delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growththe medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and is the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies divert the attention of our management impose administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the futurethe medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we have received subpoenas and other requests for information from congress and other state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services hhs and the department of defense we have also received subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies these investigations relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we have cooperated with these investigations and responded to these requests and expect to continue to do so in the future we cannot predict when the investigations will be resolved the outcome of these investigations or their impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations for example in 2009 we entered into a civil settlement with the doj regarding the dojs investigation relating to certain postmarket surveys conducted by guidant corporation before we acquired guidant in 2006 as part of the settlement we entered into a cia with the office of inspector general for hhs the cia requires enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers the obligations imposed upon us by the cia and cooperation with ongoing investigations involve employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus we may incur additional future costs to fulfill the obligations imposed upon us by the cia further the cia and if any of the ongoing investigations continue over a long period of time could further divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidityin addition certain state governments including that of massachusetts where we are headquartered and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers for value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states and starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after august 1 2013 to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our businessfurther supreme court case law has clarified that the fdas authority over medical devices preempts certain state tort laws but recently federal appeals courts have determined that some state tort law claims remain and legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention all of which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state levelchanges in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example new legislation imposes on medical device 26table of contentsmanufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations we may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven physician customers particularly in interventional cardiology have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation however intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriationcompeting parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases in addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographiesseveral third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them we have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquiditypatents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies we rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the us and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others we currently own numerous us and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending we also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments no assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid in addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions the invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsin addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing in the near future some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsfurthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual

could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations27table of contentspending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to uswe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices we are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affectedpending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customersthe design manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely a number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information these factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant further we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidityany failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operationsas a medical device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action in the european community we are required to maintain certain international standards organization iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or iso requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations28table of contentsinterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in some instances for example if the interruption is a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionwe rely on external manufacturers to supply us with certain materials components and products any disruption in our sources of supply or the price of inventory supplied to us could adversely impact our production efforts and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operationswe purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products some of which are custom made from thirdparty vendors certain supplies are purchased from singlesources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in the event of a disruption in supply we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components materials or products in a timely manner largely due to the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers manufacturing processes in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we rely on a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service production issues including capacity constraint the inability to sterilize our products quality issues affecting us or our suppliers an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour share price will fluctuate and accordingly the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuatestock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects as well as among other things changing investment priorities of our shareholders if we are unable to attract retain and focus key personnel it
