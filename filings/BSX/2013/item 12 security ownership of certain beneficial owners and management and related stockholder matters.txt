during 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market due to a variety of factors including physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association in prior years regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits as well as ongoing physician alignment to hospitals in addition our sales levels related to replacement procedures were lower than the prior year due to historical product recalls and subsequent reductions in our denovo first time icd implants following these recalls however we believe that our us denovo icd share increased throughout 2012 as a result of our incepta and energen line of defibrillators launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our highlyreliable reliance lead platformin the first half of 2012 we launched our ingenio family of pacemaker systems in the us and emea and in july 2012 we

european regulators approved an expanded indication for the watchman 41table of contentsleft atrial appendage closure device the new indication offers patients with atrial fibrillation af and a contraindication to warfarin and the newer oral anticoagulants a new treatment option for stroke reduction we are integrating the operations of the atritech business and are leveraging expertise from both our electrophysiology and interventional cardiology divisions in the commercialization of the watchman device emerging marketsas part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion described in item 1 of this annual report we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence in particular we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly in order to maximize opportunities in those countries we significantly increased sales in brazil russia india and china and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries as well as others in 2011 and throughout 2012 as a result of these efforts during 2012 we experienced doubledigit sales growth in these markets as compared to 2011 we recently created a new asiapacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region restructuring initiativeson an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital and our people that are essential to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success these initiatives are described below and additional information can be found in results of operations and note h  restructuringrelated activities to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report2011 restructuring planon july 26 2011 our board of directors approved and we committed to a restructuring initiative the 2011 restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies increase competitiveness and support new investments thereby increasing shareholder value the original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 225 million to 275 million exiting 2013 a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities relocating select administrative and functional activities rationalizing organizational reporting structures leveraging preferred vendors and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency among these efforts we are expanding our ability to deliver bestinclass global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets this action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many costreducing and productivityenhancing opportunities in addition we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies on january 25 2013 our board of directors approved and we committed to an expansion of our 2011 restructuring program the expansion the expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments which we expect to increase shareholder value we estimate that the expansion will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 100 million to 115 million exiting 2013 and that the total 2011 restructuring program including the expansion the total program will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 340 million to 375 million exiting 2013 we expect a substantial portion of the total program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities relocate select administrative and functional activities rationalize organizational reporting structures expand shared services and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions in addition they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies key activities under the total program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 20132010 restructuring planon february 6 2010 our board of directors approved and we committed to a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the 2010 restructuring plan designed to focus our business drive innovation accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value key activities under the plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions the realignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets and the reprioritization and diversification of 42table of contentsour product portfolio activities under the 2010 restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and were completed by the end of 2012 and resulted in gross reductions in pretax operating expenses of approximately 250 million a portion of these savings were reinvested into customerfacing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure plant network optimizationin january 2009 our board of directors approved and we committed to a plant network optimization program intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities the program was a complement to our 2007 restructuring plan and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins the program has resulted in annualized runrate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately 65 million exiting 2012 these savings are in addition to the 35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 restructuring plan activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and were substantially completed during 2012neurovascular divestiturein january 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of 15 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 and will receive an additional 40 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities which we expect will occur during 2013 we are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement and are also manufacturing and supplying products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in 2013 we recorded revenue of 122 million during 2012 related to this divested business as compared to 141 million during 2011 and 344 million of sales of neurovascular and other divested product lines in 2010 our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate in 2013 see results of operations and note c  divestitures and assets held for sale for additional informationhealthcare reformthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 we intend to record this tax within our selling general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to 80 million other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations further we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 43table of contentsresults of operationsnet salesas of december 31 2012 we

primarily by lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 232 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 continued average selling price declines in the us des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes in addition our us crm sales declined 114 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the us icd market lower average selling prices and lower replacement volumes partially offsetting these decreases were our endoscopy business that increased us net sales 43 million as compared to 2011 due to growth across several of its key product franchises our neuromodulation division which increased us net sales 25 million as compared to 2011 due to market share increases from strong commercial execution and continued market expansion and our peripheral interventions business which increased us net sales of 30 million as compared to 2011 on the strength of several new product launches refer to business and market overview for further discussion of our net salesduring 2011 our us net sales decreased 205 million or five percent as compared to 2010 the decrease was driven primarily by lower us crm net sales of 129 million resulting from the contraction in the us icd market in 2011 as well as lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets partially offsetting these decreases our endoscopy business increased us net sales 21 million 45table of contentsas compared to 2010 due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise and our neuromodulation division increased us net sales 29

foreign currency exchange of 13 million sales in our intercontinental region increased 86 million or 11 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in our intercontinental sales was due to growth across several of our businesses and continued growth in brazil india and china excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of 105 million net sales in our emea region decreased 48 million or three percent in 2012 as compared to 2011 driven primarily by a decline in crm and interventional cardiology net sales of 33 million and 37 million respectively partially offset by growth in all other businesses excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of 4 million our net sales in japan decreased 16 million or two percent in 2012 as compared to

other process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our year over year comparison of year to date gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million recorded in 2011 discussed further below46table of contentsthe primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011 as compared to 2010 was the negative impact of lower sales of neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our neurovascular business in addition we recognized transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million in 2011 primarily related to promus excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system in the us the decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a 50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011 related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems  declines in average selling prices of our products particularly our drugeluting stent systems were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drugeluting stent systems as we began shifting sales to our internallydeveloped and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011 in addition our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm businesswe are subject to a final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems we may record a onetime benefit or charge to our gross profit in the future as a result of this adjustment processoperating expensesthe

our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates beginning in january 2013 as a result of new legislation all medical device manufacturers will be subject to a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices we intend to record this tax within our selling general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to 80 million in 2011 our sgampa expenses decreased 93 million or four percent as compared to 2010 and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales our sgampa expenses were lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker in january 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline in addition our sgampa expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of 20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece in 2011 these receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in greece during the first quarter of 2011 the greek government converted these receivables into bonds which we were able to monetize reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to sgampa expense these decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as additional sgampa expenses related to acquisitions and global expansion initiativesresearch and development rampd expensesin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed 47table of contentsto advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2011 our rampd expenses decreased 44 million or approximately five percent as compared to 2010 and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our neurovascular business and cost reductions associated with our restructuring programsroyalty expensein 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2011 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or seven percent as compared to 2010 and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 these royalties represented 12 million of expense in 2010amortization expenseour amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011 this noncash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidityamortization expense was 421 million in 2011 as compared to 513 million in 2010 a decrease of 92 million or 18 percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011goodwill impairment charges2012 chargeswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units as described in our accounting policies we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to applyemeaas a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe while we continue to 48table of contentsproject revenue growth in our emea business our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is 556 million as of december 31 2012 in addition the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately 1563 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april 1 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis and determined that these assets were not impaired we also tested our indefinitelived intangible assets associated with emea as of april 1 2012 and recorded an impairment charge related to the inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment us crmthe us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting periodwe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would 49table of contentsrequire that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines

by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling in addition the decrease in the tax rate excluding the impact of these

resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar thirdparty casewe have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the 55table of contentsirs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsin january 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 our current financial position and results

estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the inprocess research and development projects acquired in 20102012 is between 250 million and 350 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2013 through 2017 following the respective launches of these technologies in the us emea and japan regions certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note b  acquisitions to our 2012 consolidated financial

fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2012legal mattersthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 491 million as of december 31 2012 and 299 million as of december 31 2011 and includes estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report60table of contentsto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider criticalrevenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value61table of contentswe generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairmentgoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2012 annual impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urologywomens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2012 2011 and 2010 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimateswe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million 62table of contentsof remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates

performance relative to its competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its operating segments measures of profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance  we believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for our financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  these amounts represent

impact of noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations management believes this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for

manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures furthermore we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positionsour currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of 4411 billion as of december 31 2012 and 4297 billion as of december 31 2011 we recorded 121 million of other assets and 57 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2012 as compared to 87 million of other assets and 131 million of other liabilities as of december 31 2011 a ten percent appreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by 270 million as of december 31 2012 and 230 million as of december 31 2011 a ten percent depreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by 319 million as of december 31 2012 and by 281 million as of december 31 2011 any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operationsour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 850 million in the first quarter of 2011 to convert fixedrate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floatingrate debt and subsequently terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011 we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2012 and

our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2012 2011 and 2010 76table of contentsconcentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 7 million in 2012 13 million in 2011 and 15 million in 2010 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2012 2011 or 2010 or accounts receivable at december 31 2012 or 2011 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding above historical levels prior to payment due to the fiscal and debt crises in these countries historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2012 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase as of december 31 2012 our net receivables in these countries greater than 180 days past due totaled 51 million of which 17 million were past due greater than 365 days  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price methodwe generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above77table of contentswarranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2012 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following in millions  year ended december 31  2012 2011 2010beginning balance 30 43

obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2012 and 2011 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements property plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 288 million in 2012 296 million in 2011 and 303 million in 2010valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows discount rates estimated useful lives and probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones 78table of contentsindefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization primarily include acquired stent and balloon technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and purchased research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our purchased research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify purchased research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated purchased research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition we believe that the estimated inprocess research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects however if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a wholewe test our purchased research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination for impairment at least annually during the third quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets is as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated 79table of contentsremaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment however we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and represent our best estimates see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2012 2011 and 2010for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our april 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2012 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urologywomens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2012 2011 and 2010 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage costs of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for discussion of our goodwill impairment chargesinvestments in publicly traded and privately held entitieswe account for our publicly traded investments as availableforsale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method 80table of contentsadjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we account for our investments in privately held entities for which fair value is not readily determinable in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements the book value of investments that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting was 16 million as of december 31 2012 and 7 million as of december 31 2011 we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the aggregate carrying amount of our cost method investments was 13 million as of december 31 2012 and 16 million as of december 31 2011 in addition we had notes receivable from certain companies of 5 million as of december 31 2012 and 44 million as of december 31 2011each reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations are 11041 billion as of december 31 2012 and 10346 billion as of december 31 2011we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balanceslegal and product liability costswe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our

policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims we generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable we accrue anticipated

the liability for unrecognized tax benefitsgoodwill impairment charges2012 chargeswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units as described in our accounting policies we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to applyemeaas a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe while we continue to project revenue growth in our emea business our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is 556 million as of december 31 2012 in addition the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately 1563 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april 1 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis and determined that these assets were not impaired we also tested our indefinitelived intangible assets associated with emea as of april 1 2012 and recorded an 91table of contentsimpairment charge related to the inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment us crmthe us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting periodwe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances 92table of contentsfuture events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting

information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit we updated all aspects of the dcf model associated with the us crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rate and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc to applyas a result of physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants and us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits among other factors we estimated the us crm market would experience negative growth rates in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to these estimated nearterm market reductions as well as the economic impact of physician alignment to hospitals recent demographic information released by the american heart association indicating a lower prevalence of heart failure and increased competitive and other pricing pressures we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our 15year dcf model from the midsingle digits to the lowsingle digits partially offsetting these factors were increased levels of profitability as a result of costreduction initiatives and process efficiencies within the us crm business the impact of the reduction in the size of the us icd market and the related reduction in our forecasted 2011 us crm net sales as well as the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter as a result of the trends noted above were the key factors contributing to the first quarter 2011 goodwill impairment charge93table of contents2010 chargeas a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crtd products which we announced on march 15 2010 and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010 therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 1817 billion on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with our us crm reporting unitat the time we performed our 2010 interim goodwill impairment test we estimated that our us defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions as compared to our market share exiting 2009 and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 us crm revenues by approximately 300 million in addition we expected that our ongoing us crm net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions therefore as a result of these product actions as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our 15year discounted cash flow dcf model as well as our terminal value growth rate by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit the reduction in our forecasted 2010 us crm net sales the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our

technologyrelated intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are comprised primarily of certain acquired stent and balloon technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and othernote e  fair value measurementsderivative instruments and hedging activitieswe develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use both derivative instruments currency forward and option contracts and nonderivative transactions primarily european manufacturing and distribution operations to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changesdesignated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income oci until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash 96table of contentsflow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 2469 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2088 billion as of december 31 2011we recognized net losses of 39 million during 2012 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 95 million of net losses during 2011 and 30 million of

as compared to net losses of 52 million as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 2 million of net losses net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 1942 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2209 billion as of december 31 2011interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt or fixedrate debt into floatingrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time in the first quarter of 2011 we entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 850 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges we terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011 and received total proceeds of approximately 80 million which included approximately 5 million of accrued interest receivable we are amortizing the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings over the term of the hedged debt the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 64 million as of december 31 2012 and 73 million as of december 31 2011 and unamortized losses of 3 million as of december 31 2012 and 4 million as of december 31 2011 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated floatingtofixed treasury locks of 4 million as of december 31 2012 and 7 million as of december 31 2011 the gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 11 million in 2012 and were not material in 2011 as of december 31 2012 10 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency97table of contentswe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significantfair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our

values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value generally we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2012 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by topic 820 as discussed below because these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our

where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value topic 820 establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2  inputs to the

likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 316 million as of december 31 2012 and 362 million as of december 31 2011 the decrease in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2012 as compared to december 31 2011 is attributable primarily to foreign net operating losses written off during the year offset by a change in judgment related to expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income was a charge of 43 million in 2012 benefit of 1 million in 2011 and a benefit of 16 million in 2010we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations we do not believe it is practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings 111table of contentsthat are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations were 11041 billion as of december 31 2012 and 10346 billion as of december 31

subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state local and foreign income tax matters through 2001we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationswe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 364 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2012 and 313 million as of december 31 2011 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 51 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 34 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2012 released 18 million in 2011 and recognized 14 million in 2010it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 20 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition 112table of contentscompeting parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquiditywe record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable in accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for general product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the rangeour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 491 million as of december 31 2012 and 299 million as of december 31 2011 and includes estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accruals was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2012 and 2011 we recorded litigationrelated charges in the amount of 192 million and 48 million respectively we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material

grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option we have applied based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures a weightedaverage annual forfeiture rate of approximately 102 to all unvested stock awards as of december 31 2012 which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period we reevaluate this analysis annually or more frequently if there are significant
