medical inc and atritech inc and in 2012 we completed the acquisitions of cameron health inc bridgepoint medical inc rhythmia medical inc and vessix vascular inc all discussed above there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 886 million on research and development in 2012 895 million in 2011 and 939 million in 2010 representing approximately 12 percent of our net sales each year our investment in research and development reflectsregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts which incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration productswe have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we expect will enhance our overall efficiency and effectiveness our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer innovative and manufacturable products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts8table of contentsmarketing and salesduring 2012 we marketed our products to over 13000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in nearly 100 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence we are not dependent on any single institution and no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2012 or 2011 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focusing on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 net sales and operating income attributable to our 2012 geographic regions are presented in note o  segment reporting to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report incorporated by reference herein our international structure operates through three international business units emea consisting of europe the middle east and africa japan and intercontinental consisting of our asia pacific and the americas reporting units maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth plan through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce new products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countries a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations is included in item 1a of this annual reportas of december 31 2012 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 59 percent of our products sold worldwide during 2012 were manufactured at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland as well as physician training centers in france and japanmanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization by shifting global manufacturing along product lines we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality and reliability service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectivenessour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in our manufacture of products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs 9table of contentsin certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner which could have an adverse impact on our operationspursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules may impose additional costs on us including for diligence as to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as for any resulting changes we make to products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could have an adverse effect on the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our productsquality assurancewe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented updated quality systems and concepts throughout our organization our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities including our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationin addition we maintain an ongoing initiative to seek iso14001 certification at our plants around the world iso14001 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business we engage in continuous environmental performance improvement efforts and at present as it relates to our major manufacturing and tier 1 distribution facilities 13 of our 14 facilities have attained iso14001 certification we are committed to achieving iso14001 certification at all of our major manufacturing facilities and tier i distribution centers worldwidecompetitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc and st jude medical inc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productswe believe that our products compete primarily on their ability to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as clinical outcomes ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products with differentiated clinical outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technology apply our technology costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand10table of contentsregulatory environmentthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr this process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw before we can launch new products in japan the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local data in addition to global data 11table of contentswhile harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurewe are also subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers shareholders and employees we are committed to continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policiesgovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad of legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration office state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare reform political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective treatments although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant in addition uncertainty remains regarding the continued implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act aca and its impact to our businessfurther the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to hcps licensed by certain states on the federal level we are required to begin tracking financial relationships in august 2013 and reporting by the end of the first quarter of 2014 we have devoted substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes in order to comply with these us federal and state legal and regulatory requirements in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations additionally new legislation imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 thirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients12table of contentswe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos begin to take shape in the united states initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in many countries in which we do business implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products and may influence a physicians selection of products used to treat patientsin addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesthirdparty payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement by payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by thirdparty payors that reimbursement will be available or if available that the thirdparty payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2012 we held more than 15000 patents and had approximately 7300 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledgethere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties 13table of contentswe maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm program in which we provide coordinated oversight control and continuous improvement of processes and tools used to identify and manage business risk on an annual basis we reassess our risks based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework in the areas of strategic risk financial risk external risk operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management provides increased visibility into the risks we face highlights risk interdependencies and seeks to improve overall risk management effectiveness current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payorsemployeesas of december 31 2012 we had approximately 24000 employees including approximately 12000 in operations 6000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 2000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 10000 outside the us approximately 7000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreachwe are committed to making more possible in the communities where we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our close the gap program which aims to eliminate cardiovascular care disparities by helping to ensure all patients  regardless of age gender race ethnicity or primary language  receive access to optimal cardiac care to achieve this goal close the gap provides awareness to the community about cardiovascular risk factors teaches healthcare providers about cultural beliefs and barriers to treatment and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the cardiovascular care they need by sponsoring programs and working via partnerships in the community our close the gap program has helped these messages reach over one million peoplethrough the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly with regards to science technology engineering and math stem education boston scientific has committed to contributing 15 million to our close the gap program and stem education14table of contentsseasonalityour worldwide

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report and the exhibits hereto the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of item 1 of this annual report additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operationsdeclines in average selling prices for our products particularly our drugeluting coronary stent systems may materially adversely affect our results of operationswe have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payors competitive pricing pressures have particularly affected our drugeluting coronary stent system offerings we estimate that the average selling price of our drugeluting stent systems in the us decreased seven percent in 2012 as compared to the prior year continued declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drugeluting coronary stent systems and crm products declines in market size average selling prices procedural volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete increased competition market perceptions of studies published by third parties or product launch delays may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including potential future writeoffs of our goodwill and other intangible assets balancesnet sales from drugeluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2012 in 2012 lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and declines in procedural volumes resulted in a decline in our share of the us drugeluting stent market as well as an overall decrease in the size of the market there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets that we will regain or gain share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets or that the size of the us drugeluting stent market will reach previous levels or will not decline further all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse impact on our results of operationsnet sales from our crm group represented approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012 our crm net sales declined in 2012 primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market further physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants the us department of justice investigation into hospitals icd implant practices the expansion of medicare recovery audits and ongoing physician alignment to hospitals have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the size of the crm market our us icd sales represented approximately 45 percent of our worldwide crm net sales in 2012 and any changes in this market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations there can be no assurance that the size of the crm market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to increase crm market share or increase net sales in a timely manner if at all decreases in market size or our share of the crm market and decreases in net sales from our crm products could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in addition our inability to increase our worldwide crm net sales could result in future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges further variability in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges or may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operationsconsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry including hospitals 19table of contentsthis consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers there can be no assurance that measures we may take to address these trends will succeed we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors which may continue to exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operationswe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc and st jude medical inc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productsadditionally the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change developments by other companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsbecause we derive a significant amount of our net sales from international operations and a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations including from emerging markets changes in international economic or regulatory conditions could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operationssales outside the us accounted for approximately 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 additionally a significant percentage of our future growth is expected to come from international operations including from our increased sales presence and other investments in emerging markets such as brazil russia china and india we recently created a new asiapacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region sales practices in certain international markets however may be inconsistent with our desired business practices and us legal requirements which may impact our ability to expand as planned in addition we continue to invest in infrastructure in brazil china and india including the development of a world class training center for healthcare providers and invest in local research and development and clinical studies however risks and uncertainties related to political and economic conditions in these regions traditional business practices foreign currency fluctuations interest rate fluctuations regulatory and reimbursement approvals competitive offerings infrastructure development complications and intellectual property protection may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected further international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs and certain international markets may also be impacted by foreign government efforts to understand healthcare practices and pricing in other countries which could result in increased pricing transparency across geographies and pressure to harmonize reimbursement and ultimately reduce the selling prices of our products most international jurisdictions have regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices and countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices may adopt such requirements we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions in addition the trend in countries around the world toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause us and other medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty delay risk and expense we expect the international regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions which may have a material impact on our business20table of contentsfurther any significant changes in the competitive political legal regulatory reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operationsas part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital our outstanding debt balance was at 4256 billion as of december 31 2012 and 4261 billion as of december 31 2011 in february 2012 moodys investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa3 an investmentgrade rating and in july 2011 fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb an investmentgrade rating in addition standard amp poors ratings services has maintained an investmentgrade corporate credit rating for us since 2009 we believe these ratings reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows the reduction of our debt and our improved financial fundamentals our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies however could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations in addition our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios if we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demandwe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our business or regional reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2012 we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for our europe middle east and africa emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we concluded that the goodwill within the emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a noncash 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally as of december 31 2012 are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period21table of contentson a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for our reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill we also monitor quarterly for events or other potential indicators of impairment that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets for each of these assets relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully or effectively manage the separation activities relating to the divestiture of our neurovascular business could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsas part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we completed several acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 in our strategic growth areas and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the strength of the acquired companies underlying technology and ability to execute results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the futurein addition we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation in january 2011 the divestiture of this business continues to involve a number of risks including the diversion of management and employee attention and unexpected costs and delays including with respect to the transfer of certain manufacturing facilities that we expect to occur during 2013 in addition we are providing postclosing services through a transition services agreement and are also manufacturing and supplying products to stryker these transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in 2013 our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operationswe may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologiesour strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business these acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth the success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors includingour ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at allour ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at allwhether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all andintellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or naturewe may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expense and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequencesin january 2013 we announced an expansion of our 2011 restructuring plan the expansion which is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments which we expect to increase stockholder value key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities relocate select administrative and functional activities rationalize organizational reporting structures expand shared services and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions in addition they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 22table of contentsfurther in february 2010 we announced a 2010 restructuring plan designed to strengthen and position us for longterm success key activities under the 2010 restructuring plan included the integration of our cardiovascular and crm businesses as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions the realignment of our international structure and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio additionally in january 2009 we announced our plant network optimization program aimed at simplifying our plant network reducing our manufacturing costs and improving gross margins activities under our 2010 restructuring plan were completed in 2012 and our plant network optimization program was substantially completed in 2012 cost reduction initiatives under these collective plans include various cost and efficiency improvement measures which may include headcount reductions the relocation of certain resources as well as administrative and functional activities the closure of certain facilities the transfer of certain production lines the sale of certain nonstrategic assets and other efforts to streamline our business among other actions these measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and reduced employee productivity we may be unable to attract or retain key personnel attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations in addition headcount reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation which could result in substantial cost moreover our expense reduction programs result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that these measures or other expense reduction measures we take in the future will result in the expected cost savingscurrent domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operationsthe continued global financial uncertainty including the european sovereign debt crisis has caused disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy and the strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown and european sovereign debt crisis may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors in addition current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products further our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all for example our net sales have been adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes due to unemployment levels and other economic factors and these reductions may continue in addition the european sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain southern european countries third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding within italy spain and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels while we are pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region there can be no assurances that we will be able to mitigate our risk of further reductions in cash flow in this region in addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may also adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes healthcare policy changes including recently passed healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowspolitical economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and alternative payment models are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective treatments our strategic initiatives include measures to address this trend however there can be no assurance that any of our strategic measures will successfully address this trendthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted into law in the us in march 2010 as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the us this healthcare reform law will materially impact us certain provisions of the law will not be effective until 2014 and 2015 and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood however on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the laws mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance but rejected specific provisions that would have penalized states that did not expand their current medicaid programs as a result of this ruling and other factors we expect implementation of most of the major provisions of the law to continue as currently enacted the law imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of 23table of contentsclass i ii and iii medical devices beginning in 2013 us net sales represented approximately 50 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2012 and therefore this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows other provisions of this law as currently enacted including comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations further we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally however any changes that lower reimbursements for our products reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or other participants in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business and results of operationshealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of thirdparty payors or preferences for alternate therapies could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and services even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payors further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the us japan or other international countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsmajor thirdparty payors for hospital services in the us and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed has led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the us and has shifted services between inpatient and outpatient settings initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in several countries in which we do business hospitals or physicians may respond to these costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our productswe are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved productsour products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies under the fdc act medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the us in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity the process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products couldtake a significant period of timerequire the expenditure of substantial resourcesinvolve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillancerequire changes to products andresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products24table of contents in addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products recertifications or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirementsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local data in addition to global data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurethe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the fdc act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change we cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution we may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies the failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products including those of our cardiovascular businesses are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsas a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospectsour future growth is dependent upon the development of new products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which are very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable productsin order to develop new products and improve current product offerings we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses if we are unable to develop and launch products as anticipated our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions involving opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas expanding our focus beyond our current businesses is expensive and timeconsuming further there can be no assurance that we will be able to access these 25table of contentstechnologies on terms favorable to us or that these technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance a delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growththe medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and is the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies divert the attention of our management impose administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the futurethe medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we have received subpoenas and other requests for information from congress and other state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services hhs and the department of defense we have also received subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies these investigations relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we have cooperated with these investigations and responded to these requests and expect to continue to do so in the future we cannot predict when the investigations will be resolved the outcome of these investigations or their impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations for example in 2009 we entered into a civil settlement with the doj regarding the dojs investigation relating to certain postmarket surveys conducted by guidant corporation before we acquired guidant in 2006 as part of the settlement we entered into a cia with the office of inspector general for hhs the cia requires enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers the obligations imposed upon us by the cia and cooperation with ongoing investigations involve employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus we may incur additional future costs to fulfill the obligations imposed upon us by the cia further the cia and if any of the ongoing investigations continue over a long period of time could further divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidityin addition certain state governments including that of massachusetts where we are headquartered and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers for value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states and starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after august 1 2013 to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our businessfurther supreme court case law has clarified that the fdas authority over medical devices preempts certain state tort laws but recently federal appeals courts have determined that some state tort law claims remain and legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention all of which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state levelchanges in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example new legislation imposes on medical device 26table of contentsmanufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations we may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven physician customers particularly in interventional cardiology have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation however intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriationcompeting parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases in addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographiesseveral third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them we have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquiditypatents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies we rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the us and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others we currently own numerous us and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending we also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments no assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid in addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions the invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsin addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing in the near future some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsfurthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with

litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices we are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affectedpending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our business reputation and ability to attract and retain customersthe design manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely a number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information these factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class we are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant further we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidityany failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operationsas a medical device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action in the european community we are required to maintain certain international standards organization iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or iso requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations28table of contentsinterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in some instances for example if the interruption is a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionwe rely on external manufacturers to supply us with certain materials components and products any disruption in our sources of supply or the price of inventory supplied to us could adversely impact our production efforts and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operationswe purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products some of which are custom made from thirdparty vendors certain supplies are purchased from singlesources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in the event of a disruption in supply we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components materials or products in a timely manner largely due to the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers manufacturing processes in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we rely on a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service production issues including capacity constraint the inability to sterilize our products quality issues affecting us or our suppliers an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionour share price will fluctuate and accordingly the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuatestock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects as well as among other things changing investment priorities of our

while preserving our ability to make needed investments research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are essential to our longterm success in our industry there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues if we are unable to attract key personnel in a timely manner including key sales and other personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships in the regions in which we

primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market due to a variety of factors including physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association in prior years regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits as well as ongoing physician alignment to hospitals in addition our sales levels related to replacement procedures were lower than the prior year due to historical product recalls and subsequent reductions in our denovo first time icd implants following these recalls however we believe that our us denovo icd share increased throughout 2012 as a result of our incepta and energen line of defibrillators launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our highlyreliable reliance lead platformin the first half of 2012 we launched our ingenio family of pacemaker systems in the us and emea and in july 2012 we received ce mark approval for use of our

rates for 2012 as compared to the prior year excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interventional cardiology excluding coronary stent systems worldwide net sales decreased 42 million or five percent as compared to the prior year primarily due to competitive launches and pricing pressures in april 2012 we received ce mark approval for and launched our emerge ptca dilatation catheter in our emea region and we received fda clearance for this product in september 2012 the emerge catheter is a nextgeneration predilatation balloon catheter designed specifically to offer exceptional deliverability for physicians to address challenging lesions in coronary arteries in addition in october 2012 we completed the acquisition of bridgepoint medical inc a developer of proprietary catheterbased systems to treat coronary chronic total occlusions ctos through this acquisition we expect to augment our current portfolio of interventional cardiology products which we believe will enable us to be a singlesource supplier for complex percutaneous coronary intervention pci proceduresin january 2011 we completed the acquisition of sadra medical inc through our acquisition of sadra we are developing a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis the lotus valve system consists of a stentmounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve the lowprofile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant we believe tavr is one of the fastest growing medical device markets in april 2012 we completed enrollment in the reprise i clinical trial designed to evaluate the acute safety of the lotus valve system in october 2012 we enrolled the first patients in the reprise ii clinical trial to evaluate the safety and performance of the lotus valve system the results of the reprise ii trial are expected to be used to support ce mark and other international regulatory approvals which we anticipate receiving in the second half of 2013due to revised expectations of the required effort time and cost involved in completing sadras inprocess research and development projects and bringing the related products to market we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012 refer to results of operations for further details we continue to believe that the technology associated with the sadra acquisition represents a significant future opportunity for us in the structural heart market in march 2011 we completed the acquisition of atritech inc atritech developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke the watchman left atrial appendage closure technology is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs and is approved for use in ce mark countries in august 2012 european regulators approved an expanded indication for the watchman 41table of contentsleft atrial appendage closure device the new indication offers patients with atrial fibrillation af and a contraindication to warfarin and the newer oral anticoagulants a new treatment option for stroke reduction we are integrating the operations of the atritech business and are leveraging expertise from both our electrophysiology and interventional cardiology divisions in the commercialization of the watchman device emerging marketsas part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion described in item 1 of this annual report we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence in particular we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly in order to maximize opportunities in those countries we significantly increased sales in brazil russia india and china and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries as well as others in 2011 and throughout 2012 as a result of these efforts during 2012 we experienced doubledigit sales growth in these markets as compared to 2011 we recently created a new asiapacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region restructuring initiativeson an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital and our people that are essential to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success these initiatives are described below and additional information can be found in results of operations and note h  restructuringrelated activities to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report2011 restructuring planon july 26 2011 our board of directors approved and we committed to a restructuring initiative the 2011 restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies increase competitiveness and support new investments thereby increasing shareholder value the original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 225 million to 275 million exiting 2013 a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities relocating select administrative and functional activities rationalizing organizational reporting structures leveraging preferred vendors and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency among these efforts we are expanding our ability to deliver bestinclass global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets this action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many costreducing and productivityenhancing opportunities in addition we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies on january 25 2013 our board of directors approved and we committed to an expansion of our 2011 restructuring program the expansion the expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments which we expect to increase shareholder value we estimate that the expansion will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 100 million to 115 million exiting 2013 and that the total 2011 restructuring program including the expansion the total program will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 340 million to 375 million exiting 2013 we expect a substantial portion of the total program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities relocate select administrative and functional activities rationalize organizational reporting structures expand shared services and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions in addition they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies key activities under the total program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 20132010 restructuring planon february 6 2010 our board of directors approved and we committed to a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the 2010 restructuring plan designed to focus our business drive innovation accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value key activities under the plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions the realignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets and the reprioritization and diversification of 42table of contentsour product portfolio activities under the 2010 restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and were completed by the end of 2012 and resulted in gross reductions in pretax operating expenses of approximately 250 million a portion of these savings were reinvested into customerfacing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure plant network optimizationin january 2009 our board of directors approved and we committed to a plant network optimization program intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities the program was a complement to our 2007 restructuring plan and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins the program has resulted in annualized runrate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately 65 million exiting 2012 these savings are in addition to the 35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 restructuring plan activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and were substantially completed during 2012neurovascular divestiturein january 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of 15 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 and will receive an additional 40 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities which we expect will occur during 2013 we are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement and are also manufacturing and supplying products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in 2013 we recorded revenue of 122 million during 2012 related to this divested business as compared to 141 million during 2011 and 344 million of sales of neurovascular and other divested product lines in 2010 our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate in 2013 see results of operations

act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 we intend to record this tax within our selling general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to 80 million other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations further we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 43table of contentsresults of operationsnet salesas of december 31 2012 we had four reportable segments based on geographic

primarily by lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 232 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 continued average selling price declines in the us des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes in addition our us crm sales declined 114 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the us icd market lower average selling prices and lower replacement volumes partially offsetting these decreases were our endoscopy business that increased us net sales 43 million as compared to 2011 due to growth across several of its key product franchises our neuromodulation division which increased us net sales 25 million as compared to 2011 due to market share increases from strong commercial execution and continued market expansion and our peripheral interventions business which increased us net sales of 30 million as compared to 2011 on the strength of several new product launches refer to business and market overview for further discussion of our net salesduring 2011 our us net sales decreased 205 million or five percent as compared to 2010 the decrease was driven primarily by lower us crm net sales of 129 million resulting from the contraction in the us icd market in 2011 as well as lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets partially offsetting these decreases our endoscopy business increased us net sales 21 million 45table of contentsas compared to 2010 due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise and our neuromodulation division increased us net sales 29

foreign currency exchange of 13 million sales in our intercontinental region increased 86 million or 11 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in our intercontinental sales was due to growth across several of our businesses and continued growth in brazil india and china excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of 105 million net sales in our emea region decreased 48 million or three percent in 2012 as compared to 2011 driven primarily by a decline in crm and interventional cardiology net sales of 33 million and 37 million respectively partially

other process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our year over year comparison of year to date gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million recorded in 2011 discussed further below46table of contentsthe primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011 as compared to 2010 was the negative impact of lower sales of neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our neurovascular business in addition we recognized transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million in 2011 primarily related to promus excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system in the us the decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a 50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011 related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems  declines in average selling prices of our products particularly our drugeluting stent systems were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drugeluting stent systems as we began shifting sales to our internallydeveloped and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011 in addition our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm businesswe are subject to a final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems we may record a onetime benefit or charge to our gross profit in the future as a result of this adjustment processoperating expensesthe

our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates beginning in january 2013 as a result of new legislation all medical device manufacturers will be subject to a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices we intend to record this tax within our selling general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to 80 million in 2011 our sgampa expenses decreased 93 million or four percent as compared to 2010 and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales our sgampa expenses were lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker in january 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline in addition our sgampa expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of 20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece in 2011 these receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in greece during the first quarter of 2011 the greek government converted these receivables into bonds which we were able to monetize reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to sgampa expense these decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as additional sgampa expenses related to acquisitions and global expansion initiativesresearch and development rampd expensesin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed 47table of contentsto advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2011 our rampd expenses decreased 44 million or approximately five percent as compared to 2010 and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our neurovascular business and cost reductions associated with our restructuring programsroyalty expensein 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2011 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or seven percent as compared to 2010 and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 these royalties represented 12 million of expense in 2010amortization expenseour amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011 this noncash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidityamortization expense was 421 million in 2011 as compared to 513 million in 2010 a decrease of 92 million or 18 percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011goodwill impairment charges2012 chargeswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units as described in our accounting policies we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to applyemeaas a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe while we continue to 48table of contentsproject revenue growth in our emea business our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is 556 million as of december 31 2012 in addition the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately 1563 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april 1 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis and determined that these assets were not impaired we also tested our indefinitelived intangible assets associated with emea as of april 1 2012 and recorded an impairment charge related to the inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment us crmthe us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting periodwe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would 49table of contentsrequire that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines

information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 2010 chargeas a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crtd products which we announced on march 15 2010 and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010 therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 1817 billion

that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets 2012 chargesduring the third quarter of 2012 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projects and our indefinite lived core technology assets based on the results of our annual test we recorded total impairment charges of 13 million to writedown the balances of certain inprocess projects to their fair value these charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an inprocess project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an inprocess projectfollowing the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the

fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assetsduring the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc based on our impairment analysis we revised our expectations of the required effort time and cost involved in completing the inprocess projects and bringing the related products to market as a result of these changes we recorded an impairment charge of 129 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012 2011 chargesduring the third quarter of 2011 we recorded a 9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies during the second

reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success as a result of these factors we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a 60 million charge in the first quarter of 2010 and a 5 million charge in the third quarter of 2010 to write down the

adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the 55table of contentsirs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsin january 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 our current financial position and results

amounts borrowed under this facility as of december 31 2012 or december 31 2011we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries that we account for as sales under asc topic 860 transfers and servicing these agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties without recourse of up to approximately 300 million as of december 31 2012 we have no retained interests in the transferred receivables other than collection and administrative responsibilities and once sold the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy we derecognized 191 million of receivables as of december 31 2012 at an average interest rate of 16 percent and 390 million as of december 31 2011 at an average interest rate of 33 percent the european sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain southern european countries third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding within italy spain and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our italy spain and portugal accounts receivable however we will continue to monitor the european economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables in addition we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region during the first quarter of 2011 the greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this countryin addition we have uncommitted credit facilities with a japanese bank that provide for borrowings

determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory 59table of contentsapproval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the inprocess research and development projects acquired in 20102012 is between 250 million and 350 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2013 through 2017 following the respective launches of these technologies in the us emea and japan regions certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table above does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain see note b  acquisitions to our 2012 consolidated financial

fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2012legal mattersthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 491 million as of december 31 2012 and 299 million as of december 31 2011 and includes estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report60table of contentsto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider criticalrevenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value61table of contentswe generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairmentgoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2012 annual impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urologywomens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2012 2011 and 2010 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimateswe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million 62table of contentsof remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates

profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance  we believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for our financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  these amounts represent

our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the

riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 7 million in 2012 13 million in 2011 and 15 million in 2010 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2012 2011 or 2010 or accounts receivable at december 31 2012 or 2011 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding above historical levels prior to payment due to the fiscal and debt crises in these countries historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2012 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase as of december 31 2012 our net receivables in these countries greater than 180 days past due totaled 51 million of which 17 million were past due greater than 365 days  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price methodwe generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above77table of contentswarranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2012 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following in millions  year ended december 31  2012 2011 2010beginning balance 30 43

obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2012 and 2011 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements property plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 288 million in 2012 296 million in 2011 and 303 million in 2010valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows discount rates estimated useful lives and probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones 78table of contentsindefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization primarily include acquired stent and balloon technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and purchased research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our purchased research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify purchased research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated purchased research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition we believe that the estimated inprocess research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects however if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a wholewe test our purchased research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination for impairment at least annually during the third quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets is as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated 79table of contentsremaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment however we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and represent our best estimates see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2012 2011 and 2010for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our april 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2012 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urologywomens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2012 2011 and 2010 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage costs of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets

quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method 80table of contentsadjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we account for our investments in privately held entities for which fair value is not readily determinable in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements the book value of investments that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting was 16 million as of december 31 2012 and 7 million as of december 31 2011 we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the aggregate carrying amount of our cost method investments was 13 million as of december 31 2012 and 16 million as of december 31 2011 in addition we had notes receivable from certain companies of 5 million as of december 31 2012 and 44 million as of december 31 2011each reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax

current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on

jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further

throughout 2011 upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions during 2012 we received an additional 10 million of consideration which we recorded as a gain in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations we will receive the remaining 40 million of consideration upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities which we expect will occur during 2013 due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation we recorded a pretax gain of 778 million 545 million aftertax during 2011 and a pretax gain of 15 million during 2012 associated with the transaction we recorded revenue related to the neurovascular business following its

the liability for unrecognized tax benefitsgoodwill impairment charges2012 chargeswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units as described in our accounting policies we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to applyemeaas a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe while we continue to project revenue growth in our emea business our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is 556 million as of december 31 2012 in addition the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately 1563 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april 1 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis and determined that these assets were not impaired we also tested our indefinitelived intangible assets associated with emea as of april 1 2012 and recorded an 91table of contentsimpairment charge related to the inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment us crmthe us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting periodwe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances 92table of contentsfuture events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting

information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit we updated all aspects of the dcf model associated with the us crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rate and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc to applyas a result of physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants and us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits among other factors we estimated the us crm market would experience negative growth rates in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to these estimated nearterm market reductions as well as the economic impact of physician alignment to hospitals recent demographic information released by the american heart association indicating a lower prevalence of heart failure and increased competitive and other pricing pressures we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our 15year dcf model from the midsingle digits to the lowsingle digits partially offsetting these factors were increased levels of profitability as a result of costreduction initiatives and process efficiencies within the us crm business the impact of the reduction in the size of the us icd market and the related reduction in our forecasted 2011 us crm net sales as well as the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter as a result of the trends noted above were the key factors contributing to the first quarter 2011 goodwill impairment charge93table of contents2010 chargeas a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crtd products which we announced on march 15 2010 and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010 therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 1817 billion on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with our us crm reporting unitat the time we performed our 2010 interim goodwill impairment test we estimated that our us defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions as compared to our market share exiting 2009 and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 us crm revenues by approximately 300 million in addition we expected that our ongoing us crm net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions therefore as a result of these product actions as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures we lowered our estimated average us crm net sales growth rates within our 15year discounted cash flow dcf model as well as our terminal value growth rate by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the us crm reporting unit the reduction in our forecasted 2010 us crm net sales the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our

within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and othernote e  fair value measurementsderivative instruments and hedging activitieswe develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use both derivative instruments currency forward and option contracts and nonderivative transactions primarily european manufacturing and distribution operations to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changesdesignated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income oci until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash 96table of contentsflow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 2469 billion as of

as compared to net losses of 52 million as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 2 million of net losses net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under

hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt or fixedrate debt into floatingrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time in the first quarter of 2011 we entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 850 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges we terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011 and received total proceeds of approximately 80 million which included approximately 5 million of accrued interest receivable we are amortizing the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings over the term of the hedged debt the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 64 million as of december 31 2012 and 73 million as of december 31 2011 and unamortized losses of 3 million as of december 31 2012 and 4 million as of december 31 2011 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated floatingtofixed treasury locks of 4 million as of december 31 2012 and 7 million as of december 31 2011 the gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 11 million in 2012 and were not material in 2011 as of december 31 2012 10 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency97table of contentswe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significantfair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our

values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value generally we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2012 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by topic 820 as discussed below because these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our

where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value topic 820 establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2  inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and marketcorroborated inputslevel 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are

compared to 371 million as of december 31 2011 these tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2013 after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 316 million as of december 31 2012 and 362 million as of december 31 2011 the decrease in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2012 as compared to december 31 2011 is attributable primarily to foreign net operating losses written off during the year offset by a change in judgment related to expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income was a charge of 43

subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state local and foreign income tax matters through 2001we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationswe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 364 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2012 and 313 million as of december 31 2011 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 51 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 34 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2012 released 18 million in 2011 and recognized 14 million in 2010it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 20 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition 112table of contentscompeting parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquiditywe record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable in accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for general product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the rangeour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 491 million as of december 31 2012 and 299 million as of december 31 2011 and includes estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accruals was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2012 and 2011 we recorded litigationrelated charges in the amount of 192 million and 48 million respectively we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material
