to invest in our core franchises and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into strategic growth adjacencies we have closed several acquisitions targeting many of these areas in 2011 we completed the acquisitions of sadra medical inc intelect medical inc and atritech inc and in 2012 we completed the acquisitions of cameron health inc bridgepoint medical inc rhythmia medical inc and vessix vascular inc all discussed above there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 886 million on research and development in 2012 895 million in 2011 and 939 million in 2010 representing approximately 12 percent of our net sales each year our investment in research and development reflectsregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts which incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration productswe have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we expect will enhance our overall efficiency and effectiveness our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer innovative and manufacturable products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts8table of contentsmarketing and salesduring 2012 we marketed our products to over 13000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in nearly 100 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence we are not dependent on any single institution and no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2012 or 2011 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focusing on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 50 percent of our net sales in 2012 net sales and operating income attributable to our 2012 geographic regions are presented in note o  segment reporting to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report incorporated by reference herein our international structure operates through three international business units emea consisting of europe the middle east and africa japan and intercontinental consisting of our asia pacific and the americas reporting units maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth plan through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce new products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countries a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations is included in item 1a of this annual reportas of december 31 2012 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 59 percent of our products sold worldwide during 2012 were manufactured at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland as well as physician training centers in france and japanmanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization by shifting global manufacturing along product lines we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality and reliability service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectivenessour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in our manufacture of products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs 9table of contentsin certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner which could have an adverse impact on our operationspursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules may impose additional costs on us including for diligence as to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products as well as for any resulting changes we make to products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could have an adverse effect on the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our productsquality assurancewe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented updated quality systems and concepts throughout our organization our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities including our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationin addition we maintain an ongoing initiative to seek iso14001 certification at our plants around the world iso14001 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business we engage in continuous environmental performance improvement efforts and at present as it relates to our major manufacturing and tier 1 distribution facilities 13 of our 14 facilities have attained iso14001 certification we are committed to achieving iso14001 certification at all of our major manufacturing facilities and tier i distribution centers worldwidecompetitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc and st jude medical inc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productswe believe that our products compete primarily on their ability to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as clinical outcomes ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products with differentiated clinical outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technology apply our technology costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand10table of contentsregulatory environmentthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr this process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw before we can launch new products in japan the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local data in addition to global data 11table of contentswhile harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurewe are also subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers shareholders and employees we are committed to continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policiesgovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad of legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration office state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare reform political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business including the us these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective treatments although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant in addition uncertainty remains regarding the continued implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act aca and its impact to our businessfurther the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to hcps licensed by certain states on the federal level we are required to begin tracking financial relationships in august 2013 and reporting by the end of the first quarter of 2014 we have devoted substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes in order to comply with these us federal and state legal and regulatory requirements in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations additionally new legislation imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 thirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients12table of contentswe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment models such as bundling valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos begin to take shape in the united states initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in many countries in which we do business implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products and may influence a physicians selection of products used to treat patientsin addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesthirdparty payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement by payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by thirdparty payors that reimbursement will be available or if available that the thirdparty payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2012 we held more than 15000 patents and had approximately 7300 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledgethere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties 13table of contentswe maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm program in which we provide coordinated oversight control and continuous improvement of processes and tools used to identify and manage business risk on an annual basis we reassess our risks based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework in the areas of strategic risk financial risk external risk operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management provides increased visibility into the risks we face highlights risk interdependencies and seeks to improve overall risk management effectiveness current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payorsemployeesas of december 31 2012 we had approximately 24000 employees including approximately 12000 in operations 6000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 2000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 10000 outside the us approximately 7000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreachwe are committed to making more possible in the communities where we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our close the gap program which aims to eliminate cardiovascular care disparities by helping to ensure all patients  regardless of age gender race ethnicity or primary language  receive access to optimal cardiac care to achieve this goal close the gap provides awareness to the community about cardiovascular risk factors teaches healthcare providers about cultural beliefs and barriers to treatment and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the cardiovascular care they need by sponsoring programs and working via partnerships in the community our close the gap program has helped these messages reach over one million peoplethrough the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly with regards to science technology engineering and math stem education boston scientific has committed to contributing 15 million to our close the gap program and stem education14table of contentsseasonalityour worldwide
