following the fda release of a public health notice update in july 2011 regarding complications related to the use of urogynecologic surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapsedespite the recent performance of the urologywomens health division due primarily to the market contraction as a result of the 2011 fda release of a public health notice update we believe that our urologywomens health

primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market due to a variety of factors including physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association in prior years regarding evidencebased guidelines for icd implants us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits as well as ongoing physician alignment to hospitals in addition our sales levels related to replacement procedures were lower than the prior year due to historical product recalls and subsequent reductions in our denovo first time icd implants following these recalls however we believe that our us denovo icd share increased throughout 2012 as a result of our incepta and energen line of defibrillators launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our highlyreliable reliance lead platformin the first half of 2012 we launched our ingenio family of pacemaker systems in the us and emea and in july 2012 we received ce mark approval for use of our

primarily by lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 232 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 continued average selling price declines in the us des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes in addition our us crm sales declined 114 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the us icd market lower average selling prices and lower replacement volumes partially offsetting these decreases were our endoscopy business that increased us net sales 43 million as compared to 2011 due to growth across several of its key product franchises our neuromodulation division which increased us net sales 25 million as compared to 2011 due to market share increases from strong commercial execution and continued market expansion and our peripheral interventions business which increased us net sales of 30 million as compared to 2011 on the strength of several new product launches refer to business and market overview for further discussion of our net salesduring 2011 our us net sales decreased 205 million or five percent as compared to 2010 the decrease was driven primarily by lower us crm net sales of 129 million resulting from the contraction in the us icd market in 2011 as well as lower us interventional cardiology net sales of 119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets partially offsetting these decreases our endoscopy business increased us net sales 21 million

other process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our year over year comparison of year to date gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million recorded in 2011 discussed further below46table of contentsthe primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011 as compared to 2010 was the negative impact of lower sales of neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our neurovascular business in addition we recognized transitionrelated inventory charges of 54 million in 2011 primarily related to promus excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system in the us the decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a 50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011 related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems  declines in average selling prices of our products particularly our drugeluting stent systems were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drugeluting stent systems as we began shifting sales to our internallydeveloped and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011 in addition our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm businesswe are subject to a final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems we may record a onetime benefit or charge to our gross profit in the future as a result of this adjustment processoperating expensesthe

our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates beginning in january 2013 as a result of new legislation all medical device manufacturers will be subject to a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices we intend to record this tax within our selling general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to 80 million in 2011 our sgampa expenses decreased 93 million or four percent as compared to 2010 and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales our sgampa expenses were lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker in january 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline in addition our sgampa expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of 20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece in 2011 these receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in greece during the first quarter of 2011 the greek government converted these receivables into bonds which we were able to monetize reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to sgampa expense these decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as additional sgampa expenses related to acquisitions and global expansion initiativesresearch and development rampd expensesin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed 47table of contentsto advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2011 our rampd expenses decreased 44 million or approximately five percent as compared to 2010 and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our neurovascular business and cost reductions associated with our restructuring programsroyalty expensein 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2011 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or seven percent as compared to 2010 and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 these royalties represented 12 million of expense in 2010amortization expenseour amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011 this noncash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidityamortization expense was 421 million in 2011 as compared to 513 million in 2010 a decrease of 92 million or 18 percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011goodwill impairment charges2012 chargeswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax charge in the second quarter of 2012 we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our us crm reporting unit primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles goodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units as described in our accounting policies we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to applyemeaas a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe while we continue to 48table of contentsproject revenue growth in our emea business our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is 556 million as of december 31 2012 in addition the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately 1563 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april 1 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis and determined that these assets were not impaired we also tested our indefinitelived intangible assets associated with emea as of april 1 2012 and recorded an impairment charge related to the inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment us crmthe us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012 the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately 3303 billion as of december 31 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september 30 2012 in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impaired however following the recent declines in our crm projections the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4636 billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance the 4636 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting periodwe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million of remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would 49table of contentsrequire that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over

information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 2010 chargeas a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crtd products which we announced on march 15 2010 and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010 therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 1817 billion

projects and our indefinite lived core technology assets based on the results of our annual test we recorded total impairment charges of 13 million to writedown the balances of certain inprocess

fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assetsduring the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc based on our impairment analysis we revised our expectations of the required effort time and cost involved in completing the inprocess projects and bringing the related products to market as a result of these changes we recorded an impairment charge of 129 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012 2011 chargesduring the third quarter of 2011 we recorded a 9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects 2010 chargesduring the first quarter of 2010 due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our peripheral interventions technology offerings as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology we lowered our sales forecasts associated with a product in addition during the third quarter of 2010 as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success as a result of these factors we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a 60 million charge in the first quarter of 2010 and a 5 million charge in the third quarter of 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value intangible asset impairment charges are noncash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and

by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling in addition the decrease in the tax rate excluding the impact of these

rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets changes in various state tax laws the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and the finalization of our 2010 us federal tax return in 2010 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisitionrelated milestone payment and restructuringrelated charges in 2010 our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar thirdparty case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar thirdparty casewe have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the 55table of contentsirs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsin january 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 our current financial position and results

statements included in item 8 of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2012legal mattersthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 491 million as of december 31 2012 and 299 million as of december 31 2011 and includes estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report60table of contentsto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider criticalrevenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value61table of contentswe generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairmentgoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2012 annual impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urologywomens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2012 2011 and 2010 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimateswe continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit which holds 216 million 62table of contentsof remaining allocated goodwill our us cardiovascular reporting unit which holds 2380 billion of allocated goodwill and our us neuromodulation reporting unit which holds 1266 billion of allocated goodwill each as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven  to 11 percent during the fourth quarter of 2012 the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance declines in our market share due to competitive launches and continued average selling price declines in the us drugeluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit a 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit an increase in the wacc applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates

performance relative to its competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its operating segments measures of profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance  we believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for our financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  these amounts represent

fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures the acquisitionrelated gains on previously held investments are nonrecurring benefits associated with acquisitions completed in the second quarter and fourth quarters of 2012 and the first quarter of 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments the inventory stepup adjustment is a charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our ongoing operations or ongoing cost of products sold due diligence exit costs and other
