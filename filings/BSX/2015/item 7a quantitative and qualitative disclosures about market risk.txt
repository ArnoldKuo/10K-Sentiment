we develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures furthermore we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positionsour currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of 4648 billion as of december 31 2014 and 4516 billion as of december 31 2013 we recorded 419 million of other assets and 36 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2014 as compared to 264 million of other assets and 55 million of other liabilities as of december 31 2013 a ten percent appreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by 210 million as of december 31 2014 and 257 million as of december 31 2013 a ten percent depreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by 257 million as of december 31 2014 and by 314 million as of december 31 2013 any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operationsour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixedrate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floatingrate debt we recorded 25 million of other assets and no amount of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2014 we recorded 1 million of other assets and 8 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2013 a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments fair value by 35 million as of december 31 2014 and by 37 million as of december 31 2013 a onepercentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments fair value by 39 million as of december 31 2014 and by 41 million as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2014 3387 billion of our outstanding debt
