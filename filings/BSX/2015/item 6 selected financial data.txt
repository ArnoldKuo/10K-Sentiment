interventional medical specialties our mission is to transform lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world when used in this report the terms we us our and the company mean boston scientific corporation and its divisions and subsidiariesour history began in the late 1960s when our cofounder john abele acquired an equity interest in meditech inc a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery in 1969 meditech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the first lessinvasive procedures performed in 1979 john abele joined with pete nicholas to form boston scientific corporation which indirectly acquired meditech this acquisition began a period of active and focused marketing new product development and organizational growth since then we have advanced the practice of lessinvasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical professionals treat a variety of diseases and conditions and improve patients quality of life by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the bodyour net sales have increased substantially since our formation our growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry our strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in lessinvasive procedures we believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in the current healthcare environment that seeks to improve outcomes and lower cost while navigating managed care large buying groups government contracting hospital consolidation and international expansion and will continue to assist us in navigating through the complexities of the global healthcare

strategic imperatives will drive innovation accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder valueproductsduring 2014 our products were offered for sale by seven core businesses  interventional cardiology cardiac rhythm management crm endoscopy peripheral interventions pi urology and womens health neuromodulation and electrophysiology ep in january 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation stryker we continued to generate sales from the neurovascular business pursuant to our supply and distribution agreements with stryker through mid2013 when these agreements substantially completed during 2014 we derived 28 percent of our sales from our interventional cardiology business 26 percent of our sales from our crm business 18 percent of our sales from our endoscopy business 12 percent of our sales from our pi business seven percent of our sales from our urology and womens health business six percent of our sales from our neuromodulation business and three percent of our sales from our ep business our 2014 sales from the neurovascular business that we sold to stryker were immaterial the following section describes certain of our product offeringscardiovascularinterventional cardiologydrugeluting coronary stent systemsour broad innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the interventional cardiology market this leadership is due in large part to our drugeluting coronary stent product offerings coronary stents are tiny mesh tubes used in the treatment of coronary artery disease which are implanted in patients to prop open arteries and facilitate blood flow to and from the heart we believe we have further enhanced the outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents particularly the processes that lead to restenosis the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery after angioplasty and stenting through product development and scientific research of drugeluting stent systems we market a broad portfolio of internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured drugeluting stents including the promus premier promus element and promus element plus everolimuseluting stents in addition in europe we market the synergy everolimuseluting platinum chromium coronary stent system featuring an ultrathin abluminal outer bioabsorbable polymer coating the synergy stent is unique in that both its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months this innovation has the potential to improve postimplant vessel healing and will eliminate longterm polymer exposure which is a possible cause of late adverse events core coronary technologywe market a broad line of products used to treat patients with atherosclerosis a principal cause of coronary artery obstructive disease which is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries and a narrowing of arterial openings caused by the progressive development of deposits of plaque our product offerings include balloon catheters rotational atherectomy systems guide wires guide catheters embolic protection devices crossing and reentry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca procedures  4intravascular imagingwe market a family of intravascular catheterdirected ultrasound imaging catheters and systems for use in coronary arteries and heart chambers as well as certain peripheral vessels our latest intravascular ultrasound imaging catheter opticross has been launched in all major markets worldwide the ilab ultrasound imaging system continues as our flagship console and is compatible with our full line of imaging catheters and our new polaris software designed to run on the ilab system has been approved in japan the united states us and europe and is currently launching in select markets the ilab system is designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders further these systems have been placed in cardiology labs worldwide which provide an installed base through which we expect to launch new products including an integrated fractional flow reserve ffr device structural heart therapyin january 2011 we acquired sadra medical inc sadra through the acquisition of sadra we have developed a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement tavr to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis in march 2011 we completed the acquisition of atritech inc atritech atritech developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation af who are at risk for ischemic stroke see interventional cardiology within
