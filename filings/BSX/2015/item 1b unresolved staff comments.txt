condition and results of operations of this annual report for additional informationinnovationour approach to innovation combines internallydeveloped products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions in addition we have undertaken strategic acquisitions to help enable us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry we expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into strategic growth adjacencies during the last several years we have closed multiple acquisitions to strengthen our core franchises and expand into high growth adjacencies there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 817 million on research and development in 2014 861 million in 2013 and 886 million in 2012 our investment in research and development reflects the followingregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration productswe have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle we believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts 8marketing and salesduring 2014 we marketed our products to approximately 25000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in the us and across over 110 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2014 or 2013 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our net sales in 2014 maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth strategy through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines in addition we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countriesas of december 31 2014 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 57 percent of our products manufactured in 2014 were produced at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland and china and are establishing capabilities in india we operate physician training centers in france japan and china and we are currently developing physician training centers in india and south africamanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization we believe by sourcing global manufacturing by technology capabilities we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality reliability and service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectivenessour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of each of our product families is concentrated in one location we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in the manufacturing of our products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs  9in certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operationspursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec has promulgated rules applicable to public companies that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products the rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose among other things those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these requirements could directly or indirectly adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region quality assurance we are committed to providing high quality products to our customers our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities and our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationenvironmental regulation and managementwe are subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers shareholders and employees we are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policieswe have completed an initiative and obtained iso 140012004 certification at our major manufacturing plants and tier 1 distribution centers around the world in addition in 2014 our corporate headquarters in marlborough massachusetts was certified to the iso140012004 standard iso 140012004 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the us ireland costa rica and the netherlands we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint 10competitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productswe believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as to provide ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products and solutions that offer differentiated clinical and economic outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technologies apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demandmedical device regulatory approvalsthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr for novel technologies the fda will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety effectiveness and benefitrisk of the device the pma process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations 11in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw and china food and drug administration before we can launch new products in japan and china respectively the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulationsinternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect that the global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain or maintain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain or maintain such approvals in the futuregovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration offices state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the world continue subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption in addition the impact to our business of the united states patient protection and affordable care acts aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain  12in addition the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to hcps licensed by certain states in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as governments and purchasers implement payment reforms such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos we also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other groups that seek to aggregate purchasing power continue to take shape globally similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing in addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasessee healthcare policies within item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report for additional informationthirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the us private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patientsthirdparty payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by thirdparty payors that reimbursement will be available or if available that the thirdparty payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2014 we held more than 16000 patents and had approximately 6200 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 13there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm program in which we provide coordinated oversight control and continuous improvement of processes and tools used to identify and manage business risk on an annual basis we reassess our risks based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework in the areas of strategic risk financial risk external risk operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management provides increased visibility and alignment of the risks we face and seeks to improve the effectiveness of our overall risk management current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payorsemployeesas of december 31 2014 we had approximately 24000 employees including approximately 11000 in operations 7000 in selling marketing and distribution 3000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 3000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 12000 outside the us approximately 7000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreachwe are committed to transforming lives and making a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our close the gap program which aims to eliminate treatment disparities in underserved patient populations to ensure all patients  regardless of age gender race ethnicity or primary language  receive access to quality health care  14to achieve this goal close the gap increases awareness and access to care in communities at high risk for cardiovascular gastrointestinal and pulmonary diseases engages with healthcare providers about barriers to treatment in underserved patient populations and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the care they need by sponsoring programs and executing educational programs through community partnerships in the community our close the gap program has helped these messages reach more than one million people to datethrough the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local us communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly related to science technology engineering and math stem educationseasonalityour worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year as compared to

18item 1a risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this annual report and the exhibits hereto the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of item 1 of this annual report additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operationswe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productsadditionally the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change developments by other companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsdeclines in average selling prices for our products particularly our drugeluting coronary stent systems may materially adversely affect our results of operations we have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payors any declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operationswe derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drugeluting coronary stent systems and crm products declines in market size average selling prices procedural volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete increased competition market perceptions of studies published by third parties or product launch delays may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionnet sales from drugeluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2014 in 2014 the launch of our premier drugeluting stent in the us and japan contributed to an increase in our share of the us and global drugeluting stent markets we estimate that the global market for drugeluting stents grew slightly in 2014 due to increased procedure volumes partially offset by price declines there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets that we will regain or gain share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets or that the size of the us drugeluting stent market will reach previous levels or will not decline further all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse impact on our results of operationsnet sales from our crm group represented approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014 our crm net sales increased one percent in 2014 primarily driven by increases in our denovo icd market share and our new line of defibrillators partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator market share losses in certain regions there can be no assurance that the size of the crm market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to continue to increase our crm market share or increase our net sales in a timely manner if at all decreases in market size or our share of the crm market and decreases in net sales from our crm products could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations further variability in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products may  19result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges or may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operationsconsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsbecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payors to curb these costs have catalyzed a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense this in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may increase competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operationswe are subject to a number of market business financial legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations international net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our global net sales in 2014 with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately ten percent an important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the us by expanding global presence including in in emerging markets our international operations are subject to a number of market business and financial risks and uncertainties including those related to political and economic instability foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations competitive products offerings local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems local product preferences and requirements including preferences for local manufacturers workforce instability less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the united states and in certain foreign countries longer accounts receivable cycles such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold most foreign countries have medical device regulations further most countries outside of the us require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there in addition several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data these factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsfurther international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs which can lead to lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which are our products are used governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs in addition certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries all of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products which may adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsin addition our international operations are subject to other established and developing us and foreign legal and regulatory requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa andor similar laws in other countries and us and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws global businesses including those in the medical device industry are facing increasing scrutiny of and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to their international operations any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition results of operations andor liquidity any significant changes in the political and economic financial competitive legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct or plan to expand our international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations  20if we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operationsas part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital our outstanding debt balance was at 4262 billion as of december 31 2014 and 4240 billion as of december 31 2013 in february 2012 moodys investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa3 an investmentgrade rating and in july 2011 fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb an investmentgrade rating in addition standard amp poors ratings services has maintained an investmentgrade corporate credit rating for us since 2009 we believe these ratings reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows the reduction of our debt and our improved financial fundamentals our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies however could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations in addition our credit and security facilities contains covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business if we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demandwe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operationswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates in the second quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we identified our global neuromodulation and global electrophysiology reporting units as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global neuromodulation reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 55 percent and held 1356 billion of allocated goodwill as of the date of our annual goodwil impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 38 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2014 due to changes in our expectations of the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow related to our electrophysiology reporting unit we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on this reporting unit based on this assessment we concluded that the fair value of the electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded its carrying value however the level of excess fair value over the carrying value had declined to approximately 26 percent our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had a fair value approximately equal to its carrying value however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting unit changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4097 billion globally as of december 31 2014 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4097 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 21failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsas part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we completed several acquisitions in 2014 2013 and 2012 in our strategic growth areas and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing quality systems and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the strength of the acquired companies underlying technology and ability to execute results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures the continued performance of critical transition services our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products in addition foreign acquisitions involve unique risks including those related to integration of operations across different geographies cultures and languages currency risks and risks associated with the economic political and regulatory environment in specific countries our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the futurewe may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologiesour strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business these acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth the success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors includingour ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at allthe ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companiesour ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at allwhether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businessesour ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including foreign laws and regulations andintellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or nature 22we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expense and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences on an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success for example in october 2013 we announced a restructuring initiative the 2014 restructuring plan intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments key activities under the 2014 restructuring plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes other activities under the plan involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics activities under the plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015we estimate that the 2014 restructuring plan will result in total pretax charges of approximately 250 million to 300 million and reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 175 million to 225 million by the end of 2015 we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures which may include workforce reductions the transfer of certain production lines andor the closure of certain facilities and other efforts to streamline and better align resources of our business among other actions these measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations in addition workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation which could result in substantial cost moreover our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2014 restructuring plan or other restructuring and optimization initiatives that we may undertake in the future will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savingscurrent domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations uncertainty about global economic conditions including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability these conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all in addition we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding within italy spain and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding continue to be above historical levels however the total balance outstanding for greater than 365 days has declined in the past 12 monthswhile we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to these accounts receivables there can be no assurance that further deterioration in the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may not prevent collection of these accounts receivables and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operationsthe strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy accordingly we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors in addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes 23healthcare policy changes including healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowspolitical economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption moreover there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every productthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted into law in the us in march 2010 as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the united states the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us the law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 other provisions of this law including comparative effectiveness research pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally however any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products andor procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operationshealthcare cost containment pressures government payment and delivery system reforms changes in private payer policies and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states and private health plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payors further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the united states japan or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation competitive bidding and tendering coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthirdparty payors for hospital services globally continue to implement policies to contain healthcare costs the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the us hospital consolidation and shifted services to the outpatient setting initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in several countries in which we do business hospitals or physicians may respond to these costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 24we are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products our products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies under the fdc act medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the us in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity the process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products couldtake a significant period of timerequire the expenditure of substantial resourcesinvolve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillancerequire changes to products andresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products in addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis generally every four to five years the renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where renewal or recertification applications are required they may need to be renewed andor approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirementsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurethe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the fdc act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements  25regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change we cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution we may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies the failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsas a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospectsour future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which are very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable productsin order to develop new products and enhance existing products we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses the development of new products and enhance existing products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance if we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies there can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance a delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growththe medical device industry and its customers are experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings imposition of substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including corporate integrity agreements stipulated judgments or exclusion diversion of our employees and managements attention imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities continue to highly scrutize our industry we have received subpoenas and other requests for information from congress and other state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services hhs and the department of defense as well foreign governments and agencies we have also received subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies these request andor subpoenas relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future we cannot predict when the matters will be resolved the outcome of these matters or their impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could include the commencement of an investigation civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from  26government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations for example in 2009 we entered into a civil settlement with the doj regarding the dojs investigation relating to certain postmarket surveys conducted by guidant corporation before we acquired guidant in 2006 as part of the settlement we entered into a cia with the office of inspector general for hhs which requires various provisions including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus if any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidityin addition certain foreign governments state governments including that of massachusetts where we are headquartered and the us federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers as an example compliance with the us physician payment sunshine act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the us federal level made after august 1 2013 any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our businessfurther supreme court case law has clarified that the fdas authority over medical devices preempts certain state tort laws but recently federal appeals courts have determined that some state tort law claims remain and legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention all of which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state levelchanges in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquiditywe are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 27there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations in addition effective january 1 2013 the patient protection and affordable care act imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices we recorded 72 million and 73 million of expenses within our selling general and administrative expenses during 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of this excise taxwe may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation however intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriationcompeting parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases in addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographiesseveral third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them we have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquiditypatents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies we rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the us and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others we currently own numerous us and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending we also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments no assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid in addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions the invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsin addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 28furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operationspending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to uswe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices we are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affectedpending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquiditythe design manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely a number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information these factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a classwe are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity additionally we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the fact that we do not maintain thirdparty insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidityany failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a medical device manufacturer we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action in the european community we are required to maintain certain international standards organization iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by  29notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the us or the eu and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or iso requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationsinterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditiondisruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditionmoreover pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated new rules applicable to public companies like us that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products the rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose among other things those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these requirements could directly or indirectly adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the requirements including with respect to measures undertaken to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals used in our products we rely on the proper function availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyberattack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns in addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity including from cyberattacks intrusions or other breaches could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information theft  30of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations any of these events in turn may cause us to lose existing customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to legal
