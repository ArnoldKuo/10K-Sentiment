left atrial appendage closure device along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines including our opticross coronary imaging catheter ilab intravascular ultrasound imaging system and polaris imaging systemour structural heart product offerings include our lotus valve system a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and our watchman device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke the lotus valve system consists of a stentmounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve in october 2013 we received ce mark approval and launched the lotus valve system in europe in september 2014 we initiated the reprise iii clinical trial with first patient enrollment the initiation of the reprise iii clinical trial marks the beginning of the process required to support fda premarket approval the watchman left atrial appendage closure technology watchman is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin and is marketed in ce mark countries and other international countries in the us we completed the 18 month followup prevail trial and final five year followup in the protect af trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the watchman device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation versus longterm warfarin therapy and are working towards approval of the device on october 8 2014 the fda circulatory device panel of the medical devices advisory committee the panel voted favorably six yes to five no with one abstention that the benefits of the watchman device outweigh the risks the panel also voted favorably 12 yes to zero no on the reasonable assurance of safety while voting unfavorably six yes to seven no chairman vote as tiebreaker on the question of reasonable assurance of effectiveness we are committed to working with the fda to address the panels comments and recommendations we estimate fda approval of this technology in the first half of 2015 peripheral interventionsour peripheral interventions pi product offerings include stents balloon catheters wires peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease our worldwide net sales of pi products were 850 million for the year ended december 31 2014 or

excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a 15 million negative impact on our worldwide pi net sales in 2014 as compared to 2013 net sales of these products increased 56 million or seven percent the yearoveryear increase in worldwide pi net sales was primarily driven by growth in our core pi franchise particularly our interventional oncology franchise as well as revenues from the interventional division of bayer ag bayer on august 29 2014 we completed the acquisition of the interventional division of bayer for 414 million in cash we believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions the addition of bayers strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease the transaction includes the leading angiojet thrombectomy system and the fetch 2 aspiration catheter which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins and the jetstream atherectomy system used in an innovative and fastgrowing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries 38during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of vessix a developer of catheterbased renal denervation systems for the treatment of resistant hypertension through the acquisition of vessix we added a highly differentiated technology to our hypertension strategy and launched this technology in europe in may 2013 we have seen a slowdown in the resistant hypertension market in europe following the failure of a competitors large randomized clinical trial which was announced during the first quarter of 2014 during the first half of 2014 based on a careful examination of the available data we determined that additional clinical research was required before we pursue a large global pivotal trial in december 2014 we agreed upon a study protocol with the fda for an innovative investigational device exemption trial called reducehtn reinforce the trial is designed to isolate the effects of our vessix renal denervation system while minimizing the impact of multiple medications and patient compliance as a result of changes in our clinical strategy and lower estimates of the european and global hypertension markets we reduced our expectations for future revenue and recorded impairment charges related to the vessix technology intangible assets during

cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators crtds a suite of acuity x4 quadripolar lv leads and the acuity pro lead delivery system in addition in april 2014 we received fda approval for the dynagen mini and inogen mini icds the smallest fullypowered standard longevity icd on the market as well as the dynagen x4 and inogen x4 crtds these new defibrillators were launched in the us during the second quarter of 2014 and our global rollout of this new line of defibrillators will continue into 2015 in addition our new el extended longevity line of icds was launched in the us in the first quarter of 2015 we also completed us phase i enrollment in our quadripolar lead clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2014 we expect fda approval of this lead in the first half of 2016our pacemaker system net sales remained relatively flat during 2014 as compared to 2013 our international pacemaker business grew primarily due to the continued adoption of our ingenio family of pacemakers this was offset by a decline in the us pacemaker business primarily driven by price erosion we are encouraged by physician feedback on our next generation ingevity family of magnetic resonance imaging mri compatible pacing leads in select international markets ingevity mri pacing leads are part of the imageready mrconditional pacemaker system which includes vitalio mri formio mri advantio mri and ingenio mri pulse generators when used with the latitude nxt patient management system these devices wirelessly monitor patients for conditions such as atrial arrhythmias we commenced the us investigational device exemption ide trial for the ingevity mri pacing lead during february 2013 during the second half of 2014 we also received fda approval of our new accolade family of pacemakers the second generation of ingenio pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers including a quadripolar header design we expect to initiate a full launch of this technology in 2015 39during the second quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of cameron health inc cameron cameron developed the worlds first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator the sicd system which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing icd market and expand that market over time the first generation sicd system has received ce mark and fda approval we became supply constrained in early 2013 and were only able to provide a very limited supply of sicd systems during the second and third quarters of 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we resumed our launch of our sicd system and have seen strong physician and patient interest in this differentiated technology we are also developing the emblem sicd system a next generation sicd system that is smaller in size and offers improved battery longevity and remote monitoring capabilities we expect to receive regulatory approvals and to initiate a full launch of the emblem sicd technology in europe and the us by the end of 2015electrophysiologyour electrophysiology business develops lessinvasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart our leading products include the blazer line of ablation catheters designed to deliver enhanced performance

exchange rates which had a 2 million negative impact on our electrophysiology net sales in 2014 as compared to 2013 net sales of these products increased 74 million or 48 percent the yearoveryear increase in worldwide electrophysiology net sales was driven by our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of cr bard inc bard ep which we completed on november 1 2013 through our acquisition of bard ep we obtained a strong commercial team and complementary portfolio of ablation catheters diagnostic tools and electrophysiology recording systems which we believe allows us to better serve the global electrophysiology market through a more comprehensive portfolio offering and sales infrastructure during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of rhythmia medical inc rhythmia a developer of nextgeneration mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter during the third quarter of 2014 we initiated our limited launch of the rhythmia nextgeneration mapping and navigation solution in both the us and europewe believe that the rhythmia and bard ep acquisitions as well as our other expected product launches will help to position us to participate more competitively in the growing electrophysiology marketmedsurgendoscopyour endoscopy division

and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain significant changes to medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of scs systems went into effect january 1 2014 resulting in slower trialing volumes which are typically a leading indicator of total scs market growth due to these changes in reimbursement and lower market growth rates as well as the higher prior year growth connected with the 2013 launch of precision spectra our revenue growth rate slowed throughout 2014 we have ce mark approval for use of our vercise deep brain stimulation dbs system for the treatment of parkinsons disease tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in europe during 2013 we began our us pivotal trial for the treatment of parkinsons disease we believe we have an exciting opportunity in dbs with the vercise dbs system which is designed to selectively stimulate targeted areas of the brain to customize therapy for patients and minimize side effects of unwanted stimulationemerging marketsas part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion described in item 1 of this annual report we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence including in emerging markets we define emerging markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions healthcare sectors and our global capabilities we are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our emerging markets and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities our emerging markets revenue grew 12 percent as compared to the prior year and was approximately ten percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014 neurovascular divestiturein january 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of 1500 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014 after the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement and also manufactured and supplied products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013 our sales related to our divested neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated we expect revenue from our divested neurovascular business to be immaterial in 2015 due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation divestiturerelated gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance see results of operations below and note c  divestitures to our 2014 consolidated

the markets in which we compete and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success additional information can be found in results of operations below and note h  restructuringrelated activities to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report 41healthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the world continue subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoptionthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 we recorded 72 million and 73 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively within our selling general and administrative expenses other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchaseswe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients in addition in japan the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures we expect the next reimbursement rate update in japan to be completed and take effect for the majority of our businesses during the second quarter of 2016any changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot

businesses our net sales increased 114 million or two percent as compared to the prior year this increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our endoscopy business of 87 million from our neuromodulation business of 87 million and from our peripheral interventions business of 41 million these increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in net sales from our interventional cardiology business of 121 million  43gross profitour gross profit was 5170 billion in 2014 4969 billion in 2013 and 4900 billion in 2012 as a percentage of net sales our

including other inventory charges other period expense and net impact of foreign currency0205 gross profit  current year701 696 the increase in our gross profit margin for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and

contested in the us tax court for our tax years 20012007 as with prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through appropriate irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31 2014 however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows also in connection with the irs issues a number of agreed adjustments were

and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverablewe will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets and we review our indefinitelived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value 52valuation of crmrelated amortizable intangible assetscertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our crm business are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life for purposes of testing the crmrelated amortizable intangible assets we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global crm reporting unit as a result of having identified the crm reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our crm core technology which is the primary asset within the crm asset group is utilized by all crm revenuegenerating products as a result we include cash flows generated by our crm products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life which is estimated to end in 2031 we determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business our core technology represents knowhow patented and unpatented technology testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future crm product generations this core technology includes battery and capacitor technology lead technology software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue expenses and capital expenditures which are based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates these future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the crm reporting units product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology the increased impact to the crm reporting unit from emerging markets and demographic trends toward an aging population further while our crm revenue declined in 2012 and 2013 as a result of factors specific to our crm business and contraction in the overall crm market our crm business grew one percent in 2014 we believe our crm revenue will experience low growth over the remaining useful life of our crm amortizing intangible assets we continue to perform thorough reviews of the crm market and our recent business results within the market and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life of our crmrelated amortizable intangible assetsgoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation during 2014 2013 and 2012 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows  53within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying valuealthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimatesin the second quarter of 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test as a result of the 2014 annual goodwill impairment test we identified our global neuromodulation and global electrophysiology reporting units as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global neuromodulation reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 55 percent and held 1356 billion of allocated goodwill as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 38 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2014 due to changes in our expectations of the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow related to our electrophysiology reporting unit we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on this reporting unit based on this assessment we concluded that the fair value of the electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded its carrying value however the level of excess fair value over the carrying value had declined to approximately 26 percent our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had a fair value approximately equal to its carrying value however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting unit changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges for example based on the interim goodwill assessment performed on our electrophysiology reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 50 basis points combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 100 basis points combined with a 150 basis points decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balanceslegal and product liability accrualsin the normal course of business we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify as such significant judgment  54is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us trial court or appellate proceedings and mediation arbitration or settlement proceedingsincome taxeswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit

implemented and standards to be implementedadditional informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united statesthe gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this nongaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the accompanying schedulesmanagement uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performancewe believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items 55adjusted net income and adjusted net income per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  this amount represents a noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances during 2014 2013 and 2012 a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013 a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former us cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012 and a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former emea reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012 we remove the impact of noncash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityacquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments consist of a contingent consideration fair value adjustments b gains on previously held equity interests c due diligence other fees and exit costs and d separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments due diligence other fees and exit costs include legal tax severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations accordingly management excluded these amounts for

these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceamortization expense  amortization expense is a noncash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation accordingly management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance particularly in terms of liquidity 56revenue growth rates excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange ratessales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations the impact of

adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as the sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in

intercompany transactions we assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie for any vies we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest in a vie the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both 1 the power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on our assessments under the applicable guidance we did not have controlling financial or operating interests in any vies and therefore did not consolidate any vies during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012on january 3 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation stryker due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business

consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2014 2013 and 2012 concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 15 million in 2014 12 million in 2013 and 7 million in 2012 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 or accounts receivable at december 31 2014 or 2013 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2014 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase as of december 31 2014 our net receivables in these countries greater than 180 days past due totaled approximately 26 million of which approximately 11 million were past due greater than 365 days  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our  68future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method we generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed abovewarranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2014 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following in millions  year ended

market we base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 287 million in 2014 279 million in 2013 and 288 million in 2012 69valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets in addition we review our indefinitelived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and development during 2014 2013 and 2012for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date  70amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2014 2013 and 2012for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation the discussion below for 2014 and 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 relates to our former regional reporting units we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate comprised the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including europe middle east and africa emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would  71be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2014 2013 and 2012 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate

declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2014 2013 and 2012 we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements the book value of investments that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting was 10 million as of december 31 2014 and 18 million as of

31 2013 which are accounted for in accordance with asc topic 320 investments  debt and equity securitieseach reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying  72value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign

basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 77 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balanceslegal and product liability costsin the

losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range we analyze litigation settlements to identify

electrophysiology reporting units as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global neuromodulation reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 55 percent and held 1356 billion of allocated goodwill as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 38 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2014 due to changes in our expectations of the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow related to our electrophysiology reporting unit we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on this reporting unit based on this assessment we concluded that the fair value of the electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded its carrying value however the level of excess fair value over the carrying value had declined to approximately 26 percent as of our annual goodwill impairment test date our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had a fair value approximately equal to its carrying value however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting unit changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4097 billion globally as of december 31 2014 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4097 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges for example based on the interim goodwill assessment performed on our electrophysiology reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 50 basis points combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal  83value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 100 basis points combined with a 150 basis points decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balancesfuture events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include

one or more of these factors among others could result in additional impairment charges2013 chargesfollowing our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis as of january 1 2013 we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the fair value of each global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit we tested the global crm intangible assets in conjunction with the second step of the goodwill test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to write down the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 as a result of this analysis the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge 842012 chargesin the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting

annual operating plan we performed an interim impairment test of core technology associated with certain of our acquisitions and recorded an impairment charge of 8 million for a total of 12 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2014 during the second quarter of 2014 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects and core technology associated with certain of our acquisitions based on our impairment assessment and lower expected future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we recorded impairment charges of 110 million in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of changes in our clinical strategy and lower estimates of the european and global hypertension markets and the resulting amount of future revenue and cash flows associated with the technology acquired from vessix we recorded impairment charges of 67 million related to technology intangible assets during the second quarter of 2014 in addition in the second quarter of 2014 due to revised expectations and timing as a result of the announcement of a third fda circulatory system devices panel we recorded impairment charges of 35 million related to the inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired from atritech inc atritech we also recorded an additional 8 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the amount of the expected cash flows related to certain other acquired inprocess research and development projects during the first quarter of 2014 as a result of lower estimates of the resistant hypertension market following the announcement of data from

of our annual test we recorded total impairment charges of 13 million to writedown the balances of certain inprocess projects to their fair value these charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an inprocess project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an inprocess projectduring the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess

sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use both derivative instruments currency forward and option contracts and nonderivative transactions primarily european manufacturing and distribution operations to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changesdesignated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 2178 billion as of december 31 2014 and 2564 billion as of december 31 2013we recognized net gains of 105 million during 2014 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 36 million of net gains during 2013 and 39 million of net losses during 2012 all currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2014 mature within 36 months as of december 31 2014 217 million of net gains net of tax were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to

million as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2014 128 million of net gains net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months 88the success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 2470 billion as of december 31 2014 and 1952 billion as of december 31 2013interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt or floatingrate debt into fixedrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that timein the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges and had 450 million outstanding as of december 31 2014 we assessed at inception and reassess on an ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt in 2014 we recognized in interest expense a 29 million loss on our hedged debt obligations compared to a 7 million gain on our hedged debt obligation in 2013 we also recognized in interest expenses a 29 million gain on the related interest rate derivative contracts during 2014 compared to an 8 million loss on these contracts during 2013 this resulted in net gain of less than 1 million recorded in earning due to ineffectiveness in 2014 and a net loss of 1 million recorded in earnings due to ineffectiveness in 2013in prior years we terminated certain interest rate derivative contracts including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and floatingtofixed treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges we began amortizing the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 45 million as of december 31 2014 and 54 million as of december 31 2013 and unamortized losses of 2 million as of december 31 2014 and 2 million as of december 31 2013 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated floatingtofixed treasury locks of 2 million as of december 31 2014 and 3 million as of december 31 2013 the gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 9 million in 2014 10 million in 2013 and 11 million in 2012 as of december 31 2014 9 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency 89we also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significantfair value of derivative

fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value in doing so we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2014 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by

we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 all foreign income tax matters through 2002 and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2005we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during 2014 we received a revenue agent report from the internal revenue service irs reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments for our 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in the us tax court for our tax years 20012007 as with prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through appropriate irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31 2014 however final resolution is uncertain and could have a  105material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows also in connection with the irs issues a number of agreed adjustments were contained in the irs report however no tax was paid on these amounts as there are outstanding tax receivables from the irs that are currently being withheld due to the us tax court case as these agreed items are no longer uncertain the amounts were reclassified from our uncertain tax positions to longterm which are netted against the longer term receivableswe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 443 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2014 and 402 million as of december 31 2013 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 41 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 26 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2014 recognized 22 million in 2013 and recognized 34 million in 2012it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 8 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range 106our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 1577 billion as of december 31 2014 and 607 million as of december 31 2013 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accrual was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded litigationrelated charges in the amount of 1036 billion 221 million and 192 million respectively the charges recorded in 2014 included 600 million related to the settlement agreement between our subsidiary guidant and johnson amp johnson signed on february 13 2015 we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be estimatedpatent litigation on september 22 2009 cordis corporation cordis llc

based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures a weightedaverage annual forfeiture rate of approximately nine percent to all unvested stockbased awards as of december 31 2014 which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period we reevaluate this analysis annually or more frequently if there are significant changes in circumstances and adjust the
