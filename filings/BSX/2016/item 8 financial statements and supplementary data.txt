consolidationour consolidated financial statements include the accounts of boston scientific corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions we assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie for any vies we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest in a vie the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both 1 the power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on our assessments under the applicable guidance we did not have controlling financial or operating interests in any vies and therefore did not consolidate any vies during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013on january 3 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation stryker due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business following the divestiture the divestiture

liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2015 2014 and 2013  64concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 16 million in 2015 15 million in 2014 and 12 million in 2013 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 or accounts receivable at december 31 2015 or 2014 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2015 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation generally we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method we generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 65warranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2015 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following

firstin firstout cost or market we base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 274 million in 2015 287 million in 2014 and 279 million in 2013valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones  66indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets in addition we review our indefinitelived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and development during 2015 2014 and 2013for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset  67group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2015 2014 and 2013for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2015 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2015 2014 and 2013 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether  68it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for discussion of our goodwill impairment chargesinvestments in publicly traded and privately held entitieswe account for our publicly traded investments as availableforsale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2015 2014 and 2013 we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee in accordance with asc topic 325 investments  other in addition we have notes receivable from certain companies that we account for in accordance with asc topic 320 investments  debt and equity securities refer to note b  acquisitions and strategic investments for additional details on the balances of our equity and cost method investmentseach reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax

current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2015 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 89 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain therefore judgment is required based on individual facts circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on  69technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of

specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the

primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying productscustomer relationships represent the estimated fair value of noncontractual customer and distributor relationships customer relationships are direct relationships with physicians and hospitals performing procedures with the acquired products and distributor relationships are relationships with third parties used to sell products both as of the acquisition date these relationships were valued separately from goodwill because there

tradenames these tradenames include brand names that we expect to continue using in our product portfolio and related marketing materials the tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty

of iprampd assets not previously subject to amortization to amortizable intangible assets the reclassification of iprampd to amortizable intangible assets was primarily related to the receipt of fda

within interventional medicine we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in

and deferred income taxes including changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits2015 goodwill impairment testingwe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may existin the second quarter of 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test as a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test we identified our global electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill also as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting uniton a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges for example as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant a combined increase of 50 basis points in the wacc along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global electrophysiology reporting unit the estimates used for  79our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to

relative fair value basis as of january 1 2013 we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the fair value of each global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit we tested the global crm intangible assets in conjunction with the second step of the goodwill test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million to write down the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 as a result of this analysis the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business

a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use derivative instruments and nonderivative transactions to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changescurrently or previously designated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 1458 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2178 billion as of december 31 2014we recognized net gains of 213 million during 2015 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 105 million of net gains during 2014 and 36 million of net gains during 2013 all currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2015 mature within 36 months as of december 31 2015 145 million of net gains net of tax were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of any currency derivative instruments that are or previously were designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges as compared to net gains of 217 million as of december 31 2014 as of december 31 2015 103 million of net gains net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows 83nondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 2090 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2470 billion as of december 31 2014interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt or floatingrate debt into fixedrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that timein the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges during the first quarter of 2015 we terminated these hedges and we received total proceeds of approximately 35 million which included approximately 7 million of net accrued interest receivable we assessed at inception and reassessed on an ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt in 2015 we recognized in interest expense an 8 million loss on our hedged debt compared to a 29 million loss on our hedged debt in 2014 we also recognized in interest expense an 8 million gain on the related interest rate derivative contracts during 2015 compared to a 29 million gain on these contracts during 2014 this resulted in net gains of less than 1 million recorded in earning due to ineffectiveness in 2015 and 2014during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to hedge interest rate risk associated with a planned issuance of fixedrate senior notes which we designated as cash flow hedges these hedges were terminated during the second quarter at the time we issued the fixedrate senior notes and we received total proceeds of approximately 11 million we had no amounts outstanding under these hedges as of december 31 2015 we assessed at inception and reassessed on an ongoing basis whether the cash flow derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in interest rates the gain on this derivative contract was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized into earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the related senior noteswe are amortizing the gains and losses on previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges into earnings as a component of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 63 million as of december 31 2015 and 45 million as of december 31 2014 and unamortized losses of 1 million as of december 31 2015 and 2 million as of december 31 2014 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks of 10 million as of december 31 2015 and 2 million as of december 31 2014 the net gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 13 million in 2015 9 million in 2014 and 10 million in 2013 as of december 31 2015 13 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contracts 84counterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agencywe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significantfair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges under topic 815 on our

the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the  85reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value in doing so we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities

as of december 31 2014 these tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2016 the current accounting standard for stockbased compensation prohibits the recognition of windfall tax benefits from stockbased compensation deducted for tax return purposes until realized through a reduction of income taxes payable we have 32 million  98and 2 million of us tax net operating loss as of december

included in the gross deferred taxes as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 499 million as of december 31 2015 and 450 million as of december 31 2014 representing an increase of 49 million the increase in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2015 as compared to december 31 2014 is attributable primarily to increases in certain deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not realizable the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income and stockholders equity was a charge of 25 million in 2015 a charge of 21 million in 2014 and a charge of 76 million in 2013 we have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2015 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 89 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe obtain tax incentives through free trade zone regime offered in costa rica which allows 100 exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50 exemption in the following four years this tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of 7 million for 2015 7 million for 2014 and 6 million for 2013 the tax incentive for 100 exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2023 the impact of per share earnings is immaterial for 2015 2014 and 2013as of december 31 2015 we had 1056 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 900 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of december 31 2014 we had 1047 billion of gross

multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 all foreign income tax matters through 2002 and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2005we have received notices of deficiency from the internal revenue service irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years the total incremental tax liability asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 in addition to the notices of deficiency during 2014 we received a revenue agent report from the irs reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the irs applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax yearswe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations  99we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the 2001  2007 tax years in challenge we currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016 furthermore we have submitted a letter to the irs protesting the revenue agent report for the 2008  2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing we do not believe that the irs will hear our appeal until the tax court case is concludedno payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31 2015 however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 500 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2015 and 443 million as of december 31 2014 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 57 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 37 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2015 recognized 26 million in 2014 and recognized 22 million in 2013it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 13 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range 100our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 1936 billion as of december 31 2015 and 1577 billion as of december 31 2014 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accrual was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded litigationrelated net charges in the amount of 1105 billion 1036 billion and 221 million respectively the net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims the mirowski lawsuit and certain other items the net charges recorded in 2014 include a 600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary guidant corporation guidant and johnson amp johnson signed on february 13 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by johnson amp johnson stemming from our acquisition of guidant in exchange we made aggregate payments totaling 600 million to johnson amp johnson during 2015 the 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will
