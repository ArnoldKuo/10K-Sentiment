obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions in addition we have undertaken strategic acquisitions to help enable us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry we expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets during the last several years we have completed multiple acquisitions to strengthen our core franchises and expand into high growth adjacencies and global markets there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 876 million on research and development in 2015 817 million in 2014 and 861 million in 2013 our investment in research and development reflects the followingregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration productswe have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming both where and how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle we believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we are expanding our collaboration to include global research and development teams in emerging markets these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development we believe that a large part of our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts 8marketing and salesduring 2015 we marketed our products to approximately 30000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in the us and across over 115 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence use third party distributors no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2015 or 2014 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2015 maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth strategy through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines in addition we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to strengthen our sales capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countriesas of december 31 2015 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 56 percent of our products manufactured in 2015 were produced at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland india and china we operate physician training centers in france japan south africa turkey and china and we are currently developing a physician training center in indiamanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization we believe by sourcing global manufacturing by technology capabilities we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality reliability and service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectivenessour products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of each of our product families is concentrated in one location we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in the manufacturing of our products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs  9in certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our operationsquality assurancewe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities and our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationenvironmental regulation and managementwe are subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers stockholders and employees we are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policieswe have obtained iso 140012004 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and tier 1 distribution centers around the world as well as our corporate headquarters in marlborough massachusetts iso 140012004 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the us ireland costa rica and the netherlands we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprintcompetitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic plc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products 10we believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as to provide ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technologies apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demandmedical device regulatory approvals the medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr for novel technologies the fda will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety effectiveness and benefitrisk of the device the pma process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw and china food and drug administration before we can launch new products in japan and china respectively the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical  11devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulationsinternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect that the global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain or maintain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain or maintain such approvals in the futuregovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration offices state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption in addition the impact to our business of the united states patient protection and affordable care acts aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain in addition the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency or sunshine in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments and items of value provided to hcps certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to comply with sunshine laws andor implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as governments and purchasers implement payment reforms such as prospective payment systems for hospital care preferential site of service payments valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos we also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing  12in addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate effectiveness and illustrate the economic impacts of technology purchasessee healthcare policies within item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report for additional informationthirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the us private insurance plans and managed care programs for the services provided to their patientsthirdparty payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement decisions by payers for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payers are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards indirectly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be covered automatically by thirdparty payers that adequate reimbursement will be available or even if payment is available that thirdparty payers coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2015 we held more than 16000 patents and had approximately 6500 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledgethere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved  13in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm program designed to support the achievement of our strategic and organizational objectives to improve longterm organizational performance and to enhance stockholder value on an annual basis we reassess our understanding of the individual risks we face and the steps management is taking to manage those risks using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management ensures alignment and provides increased visibility of the risks we face and seeks to continually improve the effectiveness of our overall risk management current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payersemployeesas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 25000 employees including approximately 10000 in operations 8000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 3000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 12000 outside the us approximately 7000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreach we are committed to transforming lives and making a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to educating the next generation of science technology engineering and math stem innovators is our growing global network of boston scientific stem councils these councils are designed to mobilize employees as volunteers and mentors to share their excitement of learning and working in stem fields with curious young learners around the world our focus on learning and innovation is evidenced by mentoring for inspiration and recognition of science and technology first robotics teams visiting classrooms to talk to students about the structure of the heart and stem careers along with hosting school groups at our locations for lab tours tech expos and career panel discussions in the past year nearly 1000 employee volunteers dedicated their time and talent to make a positive impact on more than 30000 children in over 12 communities around the world to increase student aspiration ability and access to stem education through the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local us communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly related to stem educationseasonalityour worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year as compared to other quarters this reflects among other factors lower demand during summer months in the northern hemisphere particularly in european countries

the exhibits hereto the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of item 1 of this annual report additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operationswe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic plc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productsadditionally the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change developments by other companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products and the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operationswe may experience declines in market size average selling prices for our products medical procedure volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers these and other factors may adversely impact market sizes as well as our share of the markets in which we compete the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes there can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionconsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsnumerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify resulting in pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may increase competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 19we are subject to a number of market business financial legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations international net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our global net sales in 2015 with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately 10 percent an important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the us by expanding global presence including in emerging markets our international operations are subject to a number of market business and financial risks and uncertainties including those related to political and economic instability foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations competitive product offerings local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems local product preferences and requirements including preferences for local manufacturers workforce instability less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the united states and in certain foreign countries longer accounts receivable cycles such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold most foreign countries have medical device regulations further most countries outside of the us require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there in addition several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data these factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsfurther international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs which can lead to lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which are our products are used governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs in addition certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries all of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products or reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used which may adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsin addition our international operations are subject to other established and developing us and foreign legal and regulatory requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa andor similar laws in other countries and us and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws global businesses including those in the medical device industry are facing increasing scrutiny of and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to their international operations any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition results of operations andor liquidity any significant changes in the political and economic financial competitive legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct or plan to expand our international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations healthcare cost containment pressures government payment and delivery system reforms changes in private payer policies and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states and private health plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payers further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the united states japan or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation competitive bidding and tendering coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of  20therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthirdparty payers for hospital services globally continue to implement policies to contain healthcare costs the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the us hospital consolidation and shifted services to the outpatient setting initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in many countries in which we do business hospitals or physicians may respond to these costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsif we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operationsas part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital our outstanding debt balance was 5677 billion as of december 31 2015 and 4244 billion as of december 31 2014 although we currently have investment grade ratings at moodys investor service standard amp poors rating service and fitch ratings our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations in addition our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business if we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demandwe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operationswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates in the second quarter of 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we identified our global electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill also as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting unit refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operationsfailure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsas part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we completed several acquisitions in 2015 2014 and 2013 and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including corporate restructuring the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations supply chain manufacturing quality systems and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies the strength of the acquired technology results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and  21reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures the continued performance of critical transition services our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products in addition foreign acquisitions involve unique risks including those related to integration of operations across different geographies cultures and languages currency risks and risks associated with the economic political legal and regulatory environment in specific countries our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our resultswe may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologiesour strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business these acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth the success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors includingour ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at allthe ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companiesour ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at allwhether we are able to complete acquisitions investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businessesour ability to successfully identify and retain key target employeesour ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including foreign laws and regulations andintellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or naturewe may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expense and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences on an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success as a result of these assessments from time to time we have undertaken various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success for example in october 2013 we announced a restructuring initiative the 2014 restructuring plan intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments key activities under the 2014 restructuring plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes other activities under the plan involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics activities under the plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and were substantially completed by the end of 2015 we estimate that the 2014 restructuring plan will result in total pretax charges of approximately 255 million to 270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately 200 million by the end of 2016 we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures which may include workforce reductions the transfer of certain production lines andor the closure of  22certain facilities and other efforts to streamline and better align resources of our business among other actions these measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations in addition workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation which could result in substantial cost moreover our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2014 restructuring plan or other restructuring and optimization initiatives that we may undertake in the future will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savingscurrent domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations uncertainty about global economic conditions including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability these conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all in addition we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstandingthe strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy accordingly we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers in addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposeshealthcare policy changes including healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowspolitical economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption moreover there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every productthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted into law in the us in march 2010 as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the united states the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us the law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 while the implementation of the medical device tax has been suspended until december 31 2017 the status of the tax for sales after december 31 2017 is not clear the tax may continue to be suspended or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level other provisions of this law including comparative effectiveness research pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operationswe cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally however any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products andor procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations 23we are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products our products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies under the fdc act medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the us in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity the process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products couldtake a significant period of timerequire the expenditure of substantial resourcesinvolve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillancerequire changes to products andresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products in addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis generally every four to five years the renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where renewal or recertification applications are required they may need to be renewed andor approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirementsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future in the european union we anticipate a new medical device regulation to be published in 2016 and it is likely to impose additional premarket and postmarket requirementsthe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda can take action against a company that promotes offlabel uses the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the fdc act and other amending acts pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products may limit a companys ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could results in a substantial modification to the companys business practices and operations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements  24regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change we cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution we may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies the failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsas a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the fdas or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospectsour future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which may be very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable productsin order to develop new products and enhance existing products we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses the development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance if we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies there can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance a delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growththe medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings imposition of substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including corporate integrity agreements stipulated judgments or exclusion diversion of our employees and managements attention imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry we have received and in the future may receive subpoenas and other requests for information from congress and other state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services hhs and the department of defense as well foreign governments and agencies we have also received and in the future may receive subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies the requests andor subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and sale andor product promotional practices we have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future we cannot predict when a matter will be resolved the outcome of the matter or its impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs an adverse  25outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing cias in addition resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations for example in 2009 we entered into a civil settlement with the doj regarding the dojs investigation relating to certain postmarket surveys conducted by guidant corporation before we acquired guidant in 2006 as part of the settlement we entered into a 5year cia with the office of inspector general for hhs which required various provisions including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus if any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidityin addition certain foreign governments state governments including that of massachusetts where we are headquartered and the us federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers as an example compliance with the us physician payment sunshine act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the us federal level made after august 1 2013 any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our businesswe anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation and have additional adverse effects on our operationschanges in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquiditywe are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs has completed its examination of the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific and has proposed significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsthere can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example impacts due to implementation related to  26base erosion and profit shifting andor proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operationswe may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation however intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriationcompeting parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases in addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographiesseveral third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them we have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquiditypatents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies we rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the us and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others we currently own numerous us and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending we also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments no assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid in addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions the invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsin addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsfurthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 27pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to uswe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies we are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under note k commitments and contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affectedpending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquiditythe design manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely a number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information these factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a classwe are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under note k commitments and contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity additionally we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the fact that we do not maintain thirdparty insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidityany failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a medical device manufacturer we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action in the european community we are required to maintain certain international standards organization iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the us or the eu and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or iso requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 28interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditiondisruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditionwe rely on the proper function availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyberattack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns in addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity including from cyberattacks intrusions or other breaches could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations any of these events in turn may cause us to lose existing customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to legal claims and liability have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour share price has been volatile and may fluctuate and accordingly the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuatestock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this item 1a entitled risk factors as well as economic and geopolitical conditions general and also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects as well as among other things changing investment priorities of our stockholders because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices  29if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results from operations  in our industry there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel the loss of one or more key employees our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any

included in item 8 of this annual reporthealthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoptionthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 the legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning

therapeutics for health act or path act was passed which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 23 percent excise tax until december 31 2017 the status of the tax for sales after december 31 2017 is not clear we intend to reinvest the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs innovation research and development collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growthwe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care preferential site of service payments valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patientsany changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot

margin for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products in addition in connection with the accounting for the ams portfolio acquisition we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value the stepup in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period in 2015 we recorded increased cost of 36 million associated with the stepupthe increase in our gross profit margin for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our

proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years the total incremental tax liability asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 in addition to the notices of deficiency during 2014 we received a revenue agent report from the irs reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the irs applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax yearswe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the 2001  2007 tax years in challenge we currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016 furthermore we have submitted a letter to the irs protesting the revenue agent report for the 2008  2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing we do not believe that the irs will hear our appeal until the tax court case is concludedno payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate

cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period generally we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverablewe will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with  50the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuegoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component for our 2015 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation during 2015 2014 and 2013 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying valuealthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimatesin the second quarter of 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test as a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test we identified our global electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill also as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting uniton a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth  51rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges for example as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant a combined increase of 50 basis points in the wacc along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global electrophysiology reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwilllegal and product liability accrualsin the normal course of business we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify as such significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us trial court or appellate proceedings and mediation arbitration or settlement proceedingsincome taxeswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain therefore judgment is required based on individual facts circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit new accounting pronouncementssee note q  new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on standards implemented and standards to be implementedadditional informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united statesthe gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income loss and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income loss per share to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this nongaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this annual reportmanagement uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance 52we believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income and adjusted net income per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  these charges represent a noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances during 2015 2014 and 2013 and b a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013 we remove the impact of noncash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance particularly in terms of liquidity acquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments consist

these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance amortization expense  amortization expense is a noncash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the financial covenants included in our credit facility or our term loan facility agreements management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments

currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures furthermore we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positionsour currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of 3547 billion as of december 31 2015 and 4648 billion as of december 31

consolidationour consolidated financial statements include the accounts of boston scientific corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions we assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie for any vies we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest in a vie the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both 1 the power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on our assessments under the applicable guidance we did not have controlling financial or operating interests in any vies and therefore did not consolidate any vies during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013on january 3 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation stryker due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business following the divestiture the divestiture

liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2015 2014 and 2013  64concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 16 million in 2015 15 million in 2014 and 12 million in 2013 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 or accounts receivable at december 31 2015 or 2014 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2015 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation generally we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method we generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 65warranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2015 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following

firstin firstout cost or market we base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 274 million in 2015 287 million in 2014 and 279 million in 2013valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones  66indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets in addition we review our indefinitelived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and development during 2015 2014 and 2013for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset  67group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2015 2014 and 2013for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2015 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2015 2014 and 2013 we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether  68it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for discussion of our goodwill impairment chargesinvestments in publicly traded and privately held entitieswe account for our publicly traded investments as availableforsale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2015 2014 and 2013 we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee in accordance with asc topic 325 investments  other in addition we have notes receivable from certain companies that we account for in accordance with asc topic 320 investments  debt and equity securities refer to note b  acquisitions and strategic investments for additional details on the balances of our equity and cost method investmentseach reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2015 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 89 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain therefore judgment is required based on individual facts circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on  69technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balanceslegal and product liability costsin the normal course of business we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products we are also the subject of certain governmental investigations which could result in substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range we analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit see note k  commitments and contingencies for discussion of our individual material legal proceedingscosts associated with exit activitieswe record employee termination costs in accordance with asc topic 712 compensation  nonretirement and postemployment benefits if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement which includes benefits provided as part of our established severance policies or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements we accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered the rights to the benefits have vested the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability we account for employee termination benefits that represent a onetime benefit in accordance with asc topic 420 exit or disposal cost obligations we record such costs into expense over the employees future service period if any other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased consultant fees and impairments of longlived assets the costs are expensed in accordance with asc topic 420 and asc topic 360 property plant and equipment and are included in restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations additionally costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives including program management costs accelerated depreciation and costs to transfer product lines among facilities are included within costs of products sold and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement

foreign subsidiaries from local currency into us dollars using the yearend exchange rate and translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year we show the net effect of these translation adjustments in our consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income for any significant foreign subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies we would remeasure their financial statements as if the functional currency were the us dollar we did not record any highly inflationary economy translation adjustments in 2015

in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our financial statements in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  70gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into

completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying productscustomer relationships represent the estimated fair value of noncontractual customer and distributor relationships customer relationships are direct relationships with physicians and hospitals performing procedures with the acquired products and distributor relationships are relationships with third parties used to sell products both as of the acquisition date these relationships were valued separately from goodwill because there

tradenames these tradenames include brand names that we expect to continue using in our product portfolio and related marketing materials the tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty

technology we tested the intangible asset for impairment prior to this reclassification and determined that the asset was not impaired  78in addition during 2015 we reclassified a total of 77 million of iprampd assets not previously subject to amortization to amortizable intangible assets the reclassification of iprampd to amortizable intangible assets was primarily related to the receipt of fda

subject to amortization are comprised primarily of certain acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in

the realignment of certain product lines from endoscopy to peripheral interventions as of january 1 2014the 2015 and 2014 purchase price adjustments relate primarily to adjustments in taxes payable and deferred income taxes including changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits2015 goodwill impairment testingwe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may existin the second quarter of 2015 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test as a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test we identified our global electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill also as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test our global cardiac rhythm management crm reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent however due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years no goodwill remains within our crm reporting uniton a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges for example as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant a combined increase of 50 basis points in the wacc along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global electrophysiology reporting unit the estimates used for  79our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in procedural volumes pricing pressures reductions in reimbursement levels product actions andor competitive technology developmentsdeclines in our market share and

one or more of these factors among others could result in impairment charges2013 chargesfollowing our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis as of january 1 2013 we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the fair value of each global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit we tested the global crm intangible assets in conjunction with the second step of the goodwill test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million to write down the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 as a result of this analysis the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business

a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to fasb asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use derivative instruments and nonderivative transactions to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changescurrently or previously designated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 1458 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2178 billion as of december 31 2014we recognized net gains of 213 million during 2015 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 105 million of net gains during 2014 and 36 million of net gains during 2013 all currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2015 mature within 36 months as of december 31 2015 145 million of net gains net of tax were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of any currency derivative instruments that are or previously were designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges as compared to net gains of 217 million as of december 31 2014 as of december 31 2015 103 million of net gains net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows 83nondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 2090 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2470 billion as of december 31 2014interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt or floatingrate debt into fixedrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that timein the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges during the first quarter of 2015 we terminated these hedges and we received total proceeds of approximately 35 million which included approximately 7 million of net accrued interest receivable we assessed at inception and reassessed on an ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt in 2015 we recognized in interest expense an 8 million loss on our hedged debt compared to a 29 million loss on our hedged debt in 2014 we also recognized in interest expense an 8 million gain on the related interest rate derivative contracts during 2015 compared to a 29 million gain on these contracts during 2014 this resulted in net gains of less than 1 million recorded in earning due to ineffectiveness in 2015 and 2014during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to hedge interest rate risk associated with a planned issuance of fixedrate senior notes which we designated as cash flow hedges these hedges were terminated during the second quarter at the time we issued the fixedrate senior notes and we received total proceeds of approximately 11 million we had no amounts outstanding under these hedges as of december 31 2015 we assessed at inception and reassessed on an ongoing basis whether the cash flow derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in interest rates the gain on this derivative contract was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized into earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the related senior noteswe are amortizing the gains and losses on previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges into earnings as a component of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 63 million as of december 31 2015 and 45 million as of december 31 2014 and unamortized losses of 1 million as of december 31 2015 and 2 million as of december 31 2014 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks of 10 million as of december 31 2015 and 2 million as of december 31 2014 the net gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 13 million in 2015 9 million in 2014 and 10 million in 2013 as of december 31 2015 13 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contracts 84counterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agencywe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significantfair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges under topic 815 on our

the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the  85reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value in doing so we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities

effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success these initiatives are described below2014 restructuring planon october 22 2013 our board of directors approved and we committed to a restructuring initiative the 2014 restructuring plan the 2014 restructuring plan is intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments key activities under the plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization pno strategy continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes the pno strategy is intended to  90simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities other activities involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics these activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and were substantially completed by the end of 2015 except for certain activities associated with our plant network optimization strategy which we expect to substantially complete by the end of 2016we estimate that the implementation of the 2014 restructuring plan will result in total pretax charges of approximately 255 million to 270 million and approximately 240 million to 255 million of these charges are expected to result in cash outlays of which we have made payments of 189 million to date we have recorded related costs of 229 million since the inception of the plan and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion

as of december 31 2014 these tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2016 the current accounting standard for stockbased compensation prohibits the recognition of windfall tax benefits from stockbased compensation deducted for tax return purposes until realized through a reduction of income taxes payable we have 32 million  98and 2 million of us tax net operating loss as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively which will be recognized through additional paid in capital upon realization of the tax benefit through reduction of income tax payable these amounts were not included in the gross deferred taxes as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 499 million as of december 31 2015 and 450 million as of december 31 2014 representing an increase of 49 million the increase in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2015 as compared to december 31 2014 is attributable primarily to increases in certain deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not realizable the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income and stockholders equity was a charge of 25 million in 2015 a charge of 21 million in 2014 and a charge of 76 million in 2013 we have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2015 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 89 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe obtain tax incentives through free trade zone regime offered in costa rica which allows 100 exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50 exemption in the following four years this tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of 7 million for 2015 7 million for 2014 and 6 million for 2013 the tax incentive for 100 exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2023 the impact of per share earnings is immaterial for 2015 2014 and 2013as of december 31 2015 we had 1056 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 900 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of december 31 2014 we had 1047 billion of gross

multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 all foreign income tax matters through 2002 and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2005we have received notices of deficiency from the internal revenue service irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years the total incremental tax liability asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 in addition to the notices of deficiency during 2014 we received a revenue agent report from the irs reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the irs applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax yearswe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations  99we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the 2001  2007 tax years in challenge we currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016 furthermore we have submitted a letter to the irs protesting the revenue agent report for the 2008  2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing we do not believe that the irs will hear our appeal until the tax court case is concludedno payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years we believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31 2015 however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 500 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2015 and 443 million as of december 31 2014 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 57 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 37 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2015 recognized 26 million in 2014 and recognized 22 million in 2013it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 13 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range 100our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 1936 billion as of december 31 2015 and 1577 billion as of december 31 2014 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accrual was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded litigationrelated net charges in the amount of 1105 billion 1036 billion and 221 million respectively the net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims the mirowski lawsuit and certain other items the net charges recorded in 2014 include a 600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary guidant corporation guidant and johnson amp johnson signed on february 13 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by johnson amp johnson stemming from our acquisition of guidant in exchange we made aggregate payments totaling 600 million to johnson amp johnson during 2015 the 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be estimated patent litigation on may 19 2005 g david jang md filed suit against us alleging breach of contract relating to certain patent rights
