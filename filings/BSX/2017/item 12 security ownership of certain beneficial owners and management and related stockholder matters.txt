offerings include our lotus valve system a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and our watchman device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke the lotus valve system consists of a stentmounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve the original lotus valve system as well as our next generation lotus edge system are cemarked in the european union eu and in the us they are investigational devices and not commercially available in october 2016 we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the lotus edge system due to reports that in some cases the device could not be fully locked during the procedure due to premature release of a pin connecting the lotus edge valve to the delivery system in february 2017 we initiated a voluntary removal of all lotus valve devices including lotus with depth guard from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of premature release of a pin connecting the lotus valve to the delivery system as with the prior announced suspension of our lotus edge valve system device we believe that the issue is caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process we expect to bring the lotus valve platform back to market in europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017 we anticipate filing the us pma submission for the lotus edge valve system the next generation platform in the fourth quarter of 2017 with a us launch planned for mid2018   the watchman left atrial appendage closure technology watchman is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin and is marketed in cemark countries and other international countries as well as the us following fda approval in march 2015 we believe that watchman will be the only laac technology commercially available in the us for multiple years in november 2015 we received ce mark for our next generation device watchman flx shortly after approval we began a european initial market release of watchman flx the initial market release was suspended near the end of the first quarter of 2016 due to a higher than expected rate of device embolization following an extensive data evaluation we have decided to pursue potential design enhancements prior to returning a next generation device to marketon december 12 2016 we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the

7477 billion as compared to 7380 billion in 2014 an increase of 97 million or one percent our net sales were unfavorably impacted by 505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015 as compared to 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses our net sales increased 606 million or eight percent as compared to the prior year this increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our urology and pelvic health business of 193 million primarily due to the ams portfolio acquisition from our interventional cardiology business of 150 million from our peripheral interventions business of 114 million and from our endoscopy business of 79 million  40gross profit our gross profit was 5962 billion in 2016 5304 billion in 2015 and 5170

the primary factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2016 as compared to 2015 was the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and other inventory charges and period expenses the increase in our gross profit margin for 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products in addition in connection with the accounting for the ams portfolio acquisition we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value the stepup in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period we recorded increased cost of 22 million in 2016 and 36 million in 2015 associated with the stepup operating expensesthe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses  year ended december 31  2016 2015

of net sales this decrease in sgampa as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing sgampa as well as the reduction in expenses resulting from the suspension of the medical device excise tax which was substantially reinvested into our strategic growth initiatives the medical device excise tax was temporarily suspended in december 2015 through december 31 2017 in 2015 our sgampa expenses decreased 29 million or one percent as compared to 2014 and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales this decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives we recorded 78 million in 2015 and 72 million in 2014 related to the medical device excise tax 41research and development rampd expenseswe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects

increased 59 million or seven percent as compared to 2014 and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the yearoveryear increase in expenses was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuationsroyalty expensein 2016 our royalty expense increased 9 million or 13 percent as compared to 2015 and remained flat at

note k  commitments and contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability mattersrevenue recognitionwe generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period generally we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist we  49assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with fasb asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuegoodwill valuationwe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component in 2016 we identified six operating segments including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions rhythm management endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation for purposes of identifying our reporting units we then assessed whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we identified rhythm management as having two components cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology for our 2016 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units which align to our seven core businesses interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation for our 2016 annual impairment assessment we aggregated the cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology reporting units components of the rhythm management operating segment based on the criteria prescribed in fasb asc topic 350 these reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016in performing the goodwill impairment assessment we utilize both the optional qualitative assessment and the twostep approach prescribed under fasb asc topic 350 beginning in 2016 the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 all other reporting units were tested using the twostep approach described below the qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and other entityspecific factors after assessing the totality of events if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary if it is determined that impairment is more likely than not then we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test in 2016 for all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units for our 2016 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed we used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether  50it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying valuealthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimatesin the second quarter of 2016 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value because our global electrophysiology reporting unit was identified as being at higher risk of potential goodwill impairment during our 2015 annual test it was tested for impairment on a standalone basis in the second quarter of 2016 immediately prior to aggregating it with our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit the fair value of the standalone global electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 36 percent in comparison the global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value of approximately 28 percent as of our 2015 annual test as of the date of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test the aggregated global electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management operating segment rhythm management had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 70 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill as such it was not deemed at higher risk of future impairment changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting unitsrefer to note d  goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for additional details related to our annual goodwill impairment testslegal and product liability accrualsin the normal course of business we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify as such significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us trial court or appellate proceedings and mediation arbitration or settlement proceedingsincome taxeswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain therefore judgment is required based on individual facts circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit new accounting pronouncementssee note q  new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on standards implemented since december 31 2015 and standards to be implementedadditional informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 51the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income loss and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income loss per share to calculate adjusted net sales that exclude sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period andor eliminate the net sales from businesses that were divested during the period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to constant currency growth rate andor growth rates excluding sales from divested business is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this annual reportmanagement uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performancewe believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and adjusted net sales that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income and adjusted net income per shareintangible asset impairment charges  this amount represents writedowns of certain intangible asset balances during 2016 2015 and 2014we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment if we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable or we conclude that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelive asset is impaired we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we exclude the impact of impairment charges from managements assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly management has excluded intangible asset impairment charges for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance acquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments may consist of a contingent consideration fair value adjustments b gains on previously held investments c purchased andor funded inprocess research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination d due diligence other fees inventory stepup amortization and integration and exit costs and e separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments due diligence other fees inventory stepup amortization and integration and exit costs include legal tax severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance restructuring and restructuringrelated net charges credits  these adjustments represent severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans these restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing core cost reduction initiatives in terms of among other things the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning resourcing cost and timing examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines  52between manufacturing facilities which due to the highly regulated nature of our industry requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines run product validations and seek regulatory approvals restructuring initiatives generally take approximately two years to complete and have a distinct project timeline that begins subsequent to approval by our board of directors in contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over this period of time are onetime shut downs or transfers and are not considered part of our core ongoing operations because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance litigationrelated net charges credits  these adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigationrelated charges and credits we record these charges and credits which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant within the litigationrelated charges line in our consolidated statement of operations all other legal and product liability charges credits and costs are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses these amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly

performance debt extinguishment charges  this item represents premiums accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of 10 billion of senior notes during the second quarter of 2015 these adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results accordingly management

lives amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating

estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value refer to investments in publicly traded and privately held entities below for additional details  64concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 11 million in 2016 16 million in 2015 and 15 million in 2014 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 or accounts receivable at december 31 2016 or 2015 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding relative to other countries prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2016 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation generally we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method we generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 65warranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2016 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following in

firstout cost or market we base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings over a 20 to 40 year life building improvements over the remaining useful life of the building structure equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 270 million in 2016 274 million in 2015 and 287 million in 2014valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones  66indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and development our indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets in addition we review our indefinitelived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and development during 2016 2015 and 2014for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assets we record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset  67group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2016 2015 and 2014for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationbased on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three global reportable segments comprised of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following global reporting units interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component in 2016 we identified six operating segments including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions rhythm management endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation for purposes of identifying our reporting units we then assessed whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we identified rhythm management as having two components cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology for our 2016 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units which align to our seven core businesses interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation as noted above for our 2016 annual impairment assessment we aggregated the cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology reporting units components of the rhythm management operating segment based on the criteria prescribed in fasb asc topic 350 these reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016 in performing the goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 we utilized both the optional qualitative assessment and the twostep approach prescribed under fasb asc topic 350 beginning in 2016 the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 all other reporting units were tested using the twostep approach the qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance and other entityspecific factors after assessing the totality of events if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary if it is determined that impairment is more likely than not then we perform the first step of the twostep impairment test in 2016 for all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these unitswhen allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitfor our 2016 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessments for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performedwe used only the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application  68of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test refer to note d  goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional details related to our annual goodwill impairment testinvestments in

investmentseach reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operations 69income taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as estimates of the impact of future taxable income and available prudent and feasible taxplanning strategieswe have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2016 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 98 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain therefore judgment is required based on individual facts circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balanceslegal and product liability costsin the normal course of business we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products we are also the subject of certain governmental investigations which could result in substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range we analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit we record certain legal and product liability

requirements we accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered the rights to the benefits have vested the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability we account for employee termination benefits that represent a onetime benefit in accordance with fasb asc topic 420 exit or disposal cost obligations topic 420 we record such costs into expense over the employees future service period if any other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased consultant fees and impairments of longlived assets the costs are expensed in accordance with fasb asc topic 420 and fasb asc

benefitsgoodwill impairment testingwe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may existin performing the goodwill impairment assessment we utilize both the optional qualitative assessment and the twostep approach prescribed under fasb asc topic 350 beginning in 2016 the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded the carrying value by greater than 100 all other reporting units were tested using the twostep approach in 2016 for all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the first step of the twostep goodwill test for all reporting units tested under the two step approach we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value because our global electrophysiology reporting  80unit was identified as being at higher risk of potential goodwill impairment during our 2015 annual test it was tested for impairment on a standalone basis in the second quarter of 2016 immediately prior to aggregating it with our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit the fair value of the standalone global electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 36 percent in comparison the global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value of approximately 28 percent as of our 2015 annual test as of the date of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test the aggregated global electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management operating segment rhythm management had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 70 percent and held 292 million of allocated goodwill as such it was not deemed at higher risk of future impairment changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units refer to note a  significant accounting policies and critical accounting policies and estimates within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges for example as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test keeping all other variables constant a combined increase of 50 basis points in the wacc along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global electrophysiology reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill future events or factors could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and negative

foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changescurrently or previously designated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign

in various currencies primarily british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under fasb asc topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 1830 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2090 billion as of december 31 2015interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt or floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015we designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under fasb asc topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that timeduring the first quarter of 2015 we terminated interest rate derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt and received total proceeds of approximately 35 million which included approximately 7 million of net accrued interest receivable we assessed at inception and reassessed on an  84ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt we had no fair value hedges outstanding during 2016 and recognized no gains or losses in interest expense during 2016 during 2015 we recognized in interest expense an 8 million loss on our hedged debt and an 8 million gain on the related interest rate derivatives contracts this resulted in immaterial net gains recorded in earning due to ineffectiveness in 2015during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to hedge interest rate risk associated with a planned issuance of fixedrate senior notes which we designated as cash flow hedges these hedges were terminated during the second quarter at the time we issued the fixedrate senior notes and we received total proceeds of approximately 11 million we had no amount outstanding under these hedges as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we assessed at inception and reassessed on an ongoing basis whether the cash flow derivative contracts were highly effective in offsetting changes in interest rates the gain on this derivative contract was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized into earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the related senior noteswe are amortizing the gains and losses on previously terminated interest rate derivative instruments including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges into earnings as a component of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 51 million as of december 31 2016 and 63 million as of december 31 2015 and immaterial unamortized losses as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated forward starting interest rate derivative contracts and treasury locks of 9 million as of december 31 2016 and 10 million as of december 31 2015 the net gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 13 million in 2016 13 million in 2015 and 9 million in 2014 as of december 31 2016 13 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agencywe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant 85fair value of

value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by fasb asc topic 820 by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for the assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value in doing so we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2016 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by topic 820 as discussed below because these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our derivative instruments 86the following are the balances of our derivative assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016 and

prices where available where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value topic 820 establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2  inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and marketcorroborated inputslevel 3  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based on managements best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date including assumptions

million and 32 million of us tax net operating loss and credits as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively these amounts were not included in the gross deferred tax balances as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 446 million as of december 31 2016 and 499 million as of december 31 2015 representing a decrease of 53 million the decrease in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2016 as compared to december 31 2015 is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax net operating losses which expired in 2016 the release was offset by an increase to the valuation allowance related to federal and state tax credits and state tax net operating loss carryforwards the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income and stockholders equity was a charge of 9 million in 2016 a charge of 25 million in 2015 and a charge of 21 million in 2014 we have not provided us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the us as of december 31 2016 the cumulative amount of excess financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested is approximately 98 billion generally such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiarieswe obtain tax incentives through free trade zone regime offered in costa rica which allows 100 exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50 exemption in the following four years this tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of 123 million for 2016 7 million for 2015 and 7 million for 2014 the tax incentive for 100 exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2023 the impact of per share earnings is 009 for 2016 and immaterial for 2015 and 2014as of december 31 2016 we had 1095 billion of gross

we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 all foreign income tax matters through 2002 and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2005we have received notices of deficiency from the internal revenue service irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years the total incremental tax liability asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 during 2014  101we received a revenue agent report from the irs reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the irs applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax yearswe do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment we have filed petitions with the us tax court tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the 2001 through 2007 tax years in challenge and submitted a letter to the irs office of appeals irs appeals protesting the revenue agent report for the 2008 through 2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing the issues in dispute were scheduled to be heard in tax court in late july 2016 on july 19 2016 we entered into a stipulation of settled issues with the irs intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues as well as the issues related to our transaction with abbott the stipulation of settled issues is contingent upon irs appeals applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the companys 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years and if applicable review by the us congress joint committee on taxation in october 2016 we reached an agreement in principle with irs appeals as to the resolution of the transfer pricing issues in 2008 2009 and 2010 tax years subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreementin the event that the conditions in the stipulation of settled items are satisfied we expect to make net tax payments to the irs of approximately 275 million plus interest through the date of payment if finalized payments related to the resolution are expected in the next nine to 18 months we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31 2016 and we do not expect to recognize any additional charges related to resolution of this controversy however the final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the stipulation of settled issues is not finalized it could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flowswe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 572 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2016 and 500 million as of december 31 2015 the increase in gross interest and penalties of 72 million was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized net tax expense related to interest and penalties of 46 million in 2016 37 million in 2015 and 26 million in 2014it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to approximately 758 millionnote k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui  102tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin accordance with fasb asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the rangeour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 2023 billion as of december 31 2016 and 1936 billion as of december 31 2015 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accrual was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded litigationrelated net charges in the amount of 804 million 1105 billion and 1036 billion respectively we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be estimated patent litigation on may 19 2005 g david jang md filed suit against us alleging breach of contract relating to certain patent rights covering stent technology the suit
