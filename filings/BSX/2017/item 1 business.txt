or third parties we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs quality assurancewe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo

which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic plc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states which could also be treated using our productswe believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a lessinvasive manner as well as to provide ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care with economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency  10we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technologies apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demandmedical device regulatory approvalsthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr for novel technologies the fda will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety effectiveness and benefitrisk of the device the pma process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european economic area eea we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives specifically the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical device directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices within the eea the ce mark is applied depending on device classification either following approval from the appointed independent notified body or through selfcertification ce marking is a symbol of compliance to the applicable essential requirements of the medical devices directive and associated standards the eu regulatory bodies will finalize a new medical device regulation mdr in 2017 which will replace the existing directives and will provide three years for transition and compliance the mdr will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework such as clinical data requirements and introduce new ones such as unique device identification udi we and the notified bodies who will oversee compliance to the new mdr face uncertainties as the mdr is rolled out and enforced by the commission and eea competent authorities creating risks in several areas including the ce marking process and data transparency in the upcoming yearswe are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products before we can launch new products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw and china food and drug administration many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations or minimal such regulations are now introducing them for example india is in the process of establishing new medical device regulationsthe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events  11labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulationsinternational sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesgovernment affairs we maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration offices state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in generalhealthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoptionthe impact to our business of the united states patient protection and affordable care acts aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial the aca and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 the legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 in december 2015 the promise for antibiotics and therapeutics for health act or path act was passed which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 23 percent excise tax until december 31 2017 we have substantially reinvested the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs innovation research and development collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growththe federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency or sunshine in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments and items of value provided to hcps certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to comply with sunshine laws andor implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations 12the federal election results in the us may result in changes to insurance coverage financing of insurance coverage in both the employersponsored insurance and individual markets government programs such as medicare and medicaid and federal sunshine laws at this point the impact of any such changes through repeal of or major changes to the aca is unclear because specific changes in laws have not been enacted similarly the status of the medical device tax after december 31 2017 is not clear while the specific policies that the new administration and congress may enact are not known as noted below we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing in the uswe expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care preferential site of service payments valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally we also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patientsthirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including government programs eg medicare and medicaid in the us and private insurance payers for the services provided to their patientsthirdparty payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated proceduresproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2016 we held more than 19000 patents and had approximately 6000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2016 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved  13employeesas of december 31 2016 we had approximately 27000 employees including approximately 13000 in operations 9000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 3000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 14000 outside the us approximately 8000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations functioncommunity outreachwe are committed to advancing science to transform the lives of others and the communities we all call home we bring this commitment to life by supporting local regional and global health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment we know that the world can be transformed when we apply the forces of compassion and the spirit of possibility to make a difference in communities today and in the future when people have greater access to healthcare and health information and when children are given the opportunity to achieve academically communities become healthy and vibrant for example by working with project hope health opportunities for people everywhere in 2016 thousands of people in the ranchi district in india and in rural johannesburg south africa were screened for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension not only were people informed about their health risks and educated about prevention but new screening protocols were implemented and healthcare workers were trained to provide services well into the future our focus on the next generation of innovators is evident in the over 150 science technology engineering and math stem events and school programs we collaborated on with others to support the evercurious minds of young learners around the world last year more than 3000 employee volunteers dedicated their time and talent to make a positive impact at more than 350 global community events in 21 countriesthrough the boston scientific foundation more than 40 nonprofit organizations across the us received nearly a million dollars in grant awards in 2016 these community grants are targeted to benefit disadvantaged populations by investing in programs that increase access to quality healthcare and improve educational opportunities particularly related to stem education in addition the foundation also provides scholarships to collegebound students of us based boston scientific employeesseasonalityour worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year as compared to other quarters this reflects among other factors
