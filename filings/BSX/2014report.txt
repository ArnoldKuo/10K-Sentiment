medical inc rhythmia medical inc and vessix vascular inc all discussed above in the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed the acquisition of the electrophysiology business of cr bard inc there can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growthresearch and developmentour investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth we expended 861 million on research and development in 2013 886 million in 2012 and 895 million in 2011 representing approximately 12 percent of our net sales each year our investment in research and development reflectsregulatory compliance clinical science and internal research and development programs as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances andengineering efforts which incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and nextgeneration products 8we have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets we are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines our approach to new product design and development is through focused crossfunctional teams we believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner involvement of the research and development clinical quality regulatory manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle we believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and costeffective manner in addition to internal development we work with hundreds of leading research institutions universities and clinicians around the world to develop evaluate and clinically test our products we believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development effortsmarketing and salesduring 2013 we marketed our products to over 13000 hospitals clinics outpatient facilities and medical offices in approximately 100 countries worldwide the majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations we also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets which accounts for our remaining sales we expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence we are not dependent on any single institution and no single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2013 or 2012 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales we have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the us focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks we consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focusing on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions we believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians we believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients international operationsinternational net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our net sales in 2013 maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our longterm growth strategy through our international presence we seek to increase net sales and market share leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countries a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations is included in item 1a of this annual reportas of december 31 2013 we had six international manufacturing facilities including three in ireland two in costa rica and one in puerto rico approximately 57 percent of our products sold worldwide during 2013 were manufactured at these facilities additionally we maintain international research and development capabilities in ireland as well as physician training centers in france japan and chinamanufacturing and raw materialswe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization we believe by sourcing global manufacturing by technology capabilities we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products we continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality and reliability service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations supplier controls distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality in addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify costimprovement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness 9our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations we consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter however significant interruptions in the manufacturing of our products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditionmany components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications we believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time we also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs in certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials components or products largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers a reduction or interruption in supply an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of raw materials components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service we believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products however to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner which could have an adverse impact on our operationspursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated new rules applicable to public companies like us that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products the rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose among other things those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these requirements could directly or indirectly adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the requirements including with respect to measures undertaken to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals used in our productsquality assurance we are committed to providing high quality products to our customers to meet this commitment we have implemented updated quality systems and concepts throughout our organization our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life these systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations including those of the fda with respect to products sold in the us all of our manufacturing facilities including our us and european distribution centers are certified under the iso13485 quality system standard established by the international standards organization for medical devices which requires among other items an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations this certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexaminationenvironmental regulation and managementwe are subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the us and abroad our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes we do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however given the scope and nature of these laws there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations we assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis at present we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our businesswe believe that sound environmental health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers shareholders and employees we are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution the depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste we are certified to the ftse4good corporate social responsibility index managed by the financial times and the london stock exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility this certification recognizes our dedication to those  10standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policiesin 2013 we completed an initiative and obtained iso14001 certification at our 14 major manufacturing plants and tier 1 distribution centers around the world iso14001 is a globally recognized standard for environmental management systems established by the international standards organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the united states ireland costa rica and the netherlands we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprintcompetitionwe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies such as pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productswe believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a lessinvasive manner as well as to provide ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity in the current environment of managed care economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency we believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and market sizes we recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to offer products and solutions that offer differentiated clinical and economic outcomes create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technology apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions attract and retain skilled personnel obtain patent or other protection for our products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals continually enhance our quality systems manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demandmedical device regulatory approvalsthe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device in the us authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways the first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the fda to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence in some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification if so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable investigational device exemption ide regulations the fda must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is requiredthe second process requires the submission of a premarket approval pma application to the fda to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use this approval process applies to most class iii devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with ide requirements the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the quality system regulation qsr this process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k processthe third process requires that an application for a humanitarian device exemption hde be made to the fda for the use of a humanitarian use device hud an hud is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4000 individuals in the us per year the application submitted to the fda for an hde is similar in both form and content to a pma application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a pma the hud  11provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populationsin the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw and china food and drug administration before we can launch new products in japan and china respectively the fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices record keeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the food drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countriesour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futuregovernment affairswe maintain a global government affairs presence headquartered in washington dc to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front the government affairs office works closely with members of congress and committee staff the white house and administration office state legislatures and regulatory agencies and governments overseas on issues affecting our business our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies the government affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general 12healthcare policiespolitical economic and regulatory influences around the globe continue subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption in addition the impact to our business of the united states patient protection and affordable care acts aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain additionally the aca imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 we recorded 73 million of expense within our selling general and administrative expenses for 2013 as a result of this excise taxin addition the federal government as part of the aca and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals hcps as a result we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to hcps licensed by certain states in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as governments and purchasers implement payment reforms such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit reimbursement levels for procedures using our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients in japan the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedureswe also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations gpos hospital networks and other groups that seek to aggregate purchasing power continue to take shape globally similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing in addition patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated therefore we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesthirdparty coverage and reimbursementour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patientsthirdparty payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by thirdparty payors that reimbursement will be available or if available that the thirdparty payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitablyproprietary rights and patent litigationwe rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property we generally file patent applications in the us and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available as of december 31 2013 we held more than 16000 patents and had approximately 7200 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology in addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a  13variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage in the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license except for those relating to our drugeluting coronary stent systems is material in relation to our business as a wholewe rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledgethere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete we continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties and if licenses are not available prevent us from manufacturing selling or using certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others patent litigation can be costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions see item 3 and note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved in managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in note k which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flowsrisk managementwe have an enterprise risk management erm program in which we provide coordinated oversight control and continuous improvement of processes and tools used to identify and manage business risk on an annual basis we reassess our risks based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso erm framework in the areas of strategic risk financial risk external risk operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives this assessment which engages key individuals from our board of directors and management provides increased visibility into the risks we face highlights risk interdependencies and seeks to improve overall risk management effectiveness current economic climateour results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices our net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from thirdparty payorsemployeesas of december 31 2013 we had approximately 23000 employees including approximately 10000 in operations 7000 in selling marketing and distribution 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development and 2000 in administration of these employees we employed approximately 11000 outside the us approximately 6000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function we believe that the continued success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and successcommunity outreach 14we are committed to making more possible in the communities where we live and work we bring this commitment to life by supporting global national and local health and education initiatives striving to improve patient advocacy adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments and minimizing our impact on the environment a prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our close the gap program which aims to eliminate cardiovascular care disparities by helping to ensure all patients  regardless of age gender race ethnicity or primary language  receive access to optimal cardiac care to achieve this goal close the gap provides awareness to the community about cardiovascular risk factors teaches healthcare providers about cultural beliefs and barriers to treatment and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the cardiovascular care they need by sponsoring programs and working via partnerships in the community our close the gap program has helped these messages reach over one million peoplethrough the boston scientific foundation established in 2001 we fund nonprofit organizations in our local us communities community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities particularly with regards to science technology engineering and math stem educationseasonalityour worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality however customer purchases have historically been lighter in the third quarter of the year as compared to other quarters this reflects among other factors lower demand during summer months

factorsin addition to the other information contained in this annual report and the exhibits hereto the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks this section contains forwardlooking statements you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of item 1 of this annual report additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operationsdeclines in average selling prices for our products particularly our drugeluting coronary stent systems may materially adversely affect our results of operations we have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payors competitive pricing pressures have particularly affected our drugeluting coronary stent system offerings continued declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drugeluting coronary stent systems and crm products declines in market size average selling prices procedural volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete increased competition market perceptions of studies published by third parties or product launch delays may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including potential future writeoffs of our goodwill and other intangible assets balances net sales from drugeluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2013 in 2013 lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and declines in procedural volumes resulted in a decline in our share of the us drugeluting stent market as well as an overall decrease in the size of the market there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets that we will regain or gain share of the us or worldwide drugeluting stent markets or that the size of the us drugeluting stent market will reach previous levels or will not decline further all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse impact on our results of operationsnet sales from our crm group represented approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013 our crm net sales declined in 2013 primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures partially offset by slight increases in unit volumes there can be no assurance that the size of the crm market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to increase crm market share or increase net sales in a timely manner if at all decreases in market size or our share of the crm market and decreases in net sales from our crm products could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in addition our inability to increase our worldwide crm net sales could result in future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges further variability in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges or may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operationsconsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsbecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payors to curb these costs have catalyzed a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power as the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense this in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals we expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may increase competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 19we face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do our primary competitors include abbott laboratories medtronic inc st jude medical inc and cook medical as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment we also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our productsadditionally the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change developments by other companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationswe are subject to a number of market business financial legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations which could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations international net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our global net sales in 2013 with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately eight percent an important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the us by expanding global presence including in in emerging markets our international operations are subject to a number of market business and financial risks and uncertainties including those related to political and economic conditions foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations competitive products offerings local product preferences and requirements intellectual property protection and in certain foreign countries longer accounts receivable cycles such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold most foreign countries have medical device regulations further most countries outside of the us require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there in addition several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulations including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data these factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsfurther international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs and certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to harmonize reimbursement rates and ultimately reduce selling prices of our products which may adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operationsin addition our international operations are subject to other established and developing us and foreign legal and regulatory requirements including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa andor similar laws in other countries and us and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws global businesses including those in the medical device industry are facing increasing scrutiny of and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to their international operations any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition results of operations andor liquidity any significant changes in the political and economic financial competitive legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct or plan to expand our international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations  20if we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operationsas part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital our outstanding debt balance was at 4240 billion as of december 31 2013 and 4256 billion as of december 31 2012 in february 2012 moodys investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa3 an investmentgrade rating and in july 2011 fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb an investmentgrade rating in addition standard amp poors ratings services has maintained an investmentgrade corporate credit rating for us since 2009 we believe these ratings reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows the reduction of our debt and our improved financial fundamentals our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies however could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations in addition our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios if we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demandwe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operationswe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates effective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of our new organizational structure we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our 2012 annual goodwill impairment test we recorded a noncash 3602 billion 3579 billion after tax impairment charge of the goodwill within our former europe middle east and africa emea reporting unit further in the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us crm reporting unitwe have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 21failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsas part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we completed several acquisitions in 2013 2012 and 2011 in our strategic growth areas and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations manufacturing and finance these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the strength of the acquired companies underlying technology and ability to execute results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth in addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the futurewe may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologiesour strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business these acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth the success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors includingour ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at allour ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at allwhether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all andintellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or nature 22we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expense and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequences  on an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success for example in october 2013 we announced a restructuring initiative the 2014 restructuring plan intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments key activities under the 2014 restructuring plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes other activities under the plan involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics activities under the plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015 we estimate that the 2014 restructuring plan will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 150 million to 200 million exiting 2015 and we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures which may include workforce reductions the transfer of certain production lines andor the closure of certain facilities and other efforts to streamline and better align resources of our business among other actions these measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations in addition workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation which could result in substantial cost moreover our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results we cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2014 restructuring plan or other restructuring and optimization initiatives that we may undertake in the future will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savingscurrent domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations uncertainty about global economic conditions including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability these conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis if at all in addition we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt this could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding within italy spain and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding continue to be above historical levels while we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to these accounts receivables there can be no assurance that further deterioration in the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may not prevent collection of these accounts receivables and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operationsthe strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy accordingly we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the us and abroad may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors in addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes 23healthcare policy changes including recently passed healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flowspolitical economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business we believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payors and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption moreover there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every productthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 were enacted into law in the us in march 2010 as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the united states this healthcare reform law will materially impact us certain provisions of the law will not be effective until 2014 and 2015 while many of the laws programs and requirements are not fully established and the consequences are not fully understood one provision the medical device tax is having a direct impact the law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 other provisions of this law including comparative effectiveness research and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations any changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally however any changes that lower reimbursements for our products reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or other participants in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business and results of operationshealthcare cost containment pressures government payment and delivery system reforms changes in private payer policies and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs eg medicare and medicaid in the united states and private health plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payors further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the united states japan or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation competitive pricing and tendering coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthirdparty payors for hospital services globally continue to implement policies to contain healthcare costs the introduction of cost containment incentives combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the united states led to hospital consolidation and shifted services to the outpatient setting initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs including price regulation are also underway in several countries in which we do business hospitals or physicians may respond to these costcontainment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 24we are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products our products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdc act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies under the fdc act medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the us in the european union we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity the process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products couldtake a significant period of timerequire the expenditure of substantial resourcesinvolve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillancerequire changes to products andresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products in addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis generally every four to five years the renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where renewal or recertification applications are required they may need to be renewed andor approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirementsour global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data while harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the futurethe fda and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices the fda can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the fdc act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements  25regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change we cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution we may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies the failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the fda or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour products including those of our cardiovascular businesses are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsas a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospectsour future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which are very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable productsin order to develop new products and enhance existing products we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses the development of new products and enhance existing products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance if we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions investments involving opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies there can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance a delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth 26the medical device industry and its customers are experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories these investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings imposition of substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including corporate integrity agreements stipulated judgments or exclusion divert the attention of our employees and management impose administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future  the medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities these authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry we have received subpoenas and other requests for information from congress and other state and federal governmental agencies including among others the us department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services hhs and the department of defense we have also received subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies these investigations relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and product promotional practices we have cooperated with these investigations and responded to these requests and expect to continue to do so in the future we cannot predict when the investigations will be resolved the outcome of these investigations or their impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into corporate integrity agreements cias with governmental agencies and amendments to existing cias in addition resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations for example in 2009 we entered into a civil settlement with the doj regarding the dojs investigation relating to certain postmarket surveys conducted by guidant corporation before we acquired guidant in 2006 as part of the settlement we entered into a cia with the office of inspector general for hhs the cia requires enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers the obligations imposed upon us by the cia and cooperation with ongoing investigations involve employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus we may incur additional future costs to fulfill the obligations imposed upon us by the cia further the cia and if any of the ongoing investigations continue over a long period of time could further divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us these potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidityin addition certain state governments including that of massachusetts where we are headquartered and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers as a result we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers for value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states and starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after august 1 2013 to all us physicians and us teaching hospitals at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business in addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our businessfurther supreme court case law has clarified that the fdas authority over medical devices preempts certain state tort laws but recently federal appeals courts have determined that some state tort law claims remain and legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention all of which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state levelchanges in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes  27we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operationsthere can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example proposals for fundamental us corporate tax reform if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations in addition effective january 1 2013 the patient protection and affordable care act imposes a 23 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices and for 2013 we recorded 73 million of expenses within our selling general and administrative expenses as a result of this excise tax we may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation however intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriationcompeting parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases in addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographiesseveral third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them we have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 28patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies we rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position we pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the us and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others we currently own numerous us and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending we also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments no assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid in addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions the invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsin addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing in the near future some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsfurthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operationspending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to uswe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices we are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all

proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under item 3 legal proceedings and note k commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity additionally we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the fact that we do not maintain thirdparty

results of operations or liquidityany failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  as a medical device manufacturer we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with its quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda which may result in observations on form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action in the european community we are required to maintain certain international standards organization iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications if we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or iso requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operationsinterruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties in most cases the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditiondisruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity regulatory or other constraints we may be unable to transition to other vendors in a timely or cost effective manner which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 30moreover pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the securities and exchange commission sec promulgated new rules applicable to public companies like us that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products the rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose among other things those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these requirements could directly or indirectly adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with the requirements including with respect to measures undertaken to understand the origin and as need be source of conflict minerals used in our products our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate and accordingly the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuatestock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this item 1a entitled risk

to attract key personnel in a timely manner including key sales and other personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships in the regions in which we operate including in emerging markets it may have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to drive growth including through execution of our strategic initiatives furthermore some of the key personnel for whom we compete have postemployment arrangements with their current or former employer that may impact our ability to hire them or expose us and them to claims in addition if we are unable to retain and focus our

treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures and intravascular ultrasound ivus imaging systems in the first quarter of 2013 we received ce mark approval and launched our promus premier everolimuseluting platinum chromium coronary stent system in europe and other select geographies in the fourth quarter of 2013 we received fda approval and launched promus premier in the us the promus premier stent system is designed to provide physicians improved drugeluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease featuring unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system we have also received ce mark approval for our next generation synergy everolimuseluting platinum chromium coronary stent system featuring an ultrathin abluminal outer bioabsorbable polymer coating and have commenced a limited commercial launch we expect to expand the launch in europe in the first half of 2014 the synergy stent is unique in that its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months this innovation has the potential to improve postimplant vessel healing and eliminate longterm polymer exposure a possible cause of late adverse events we have completed patient enrollment in the evolve ii clinical trial which is designed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the synergy stent system and support us food and drug administration and japanese regulatory approvals for this technologyour

which had a 58 million negative impact on our interventional cardiology net sales in 2013 as compared to 2012 net sales of these products decreased 124 million or six percent this decrease was primarily due to lower coronary stent system sales partially offset by higher sales of our nonstent interventional cardiology productsour coronary stent system sales represent a significant portion of

in 2013 as compared to 2012 our us net sales of drugeluting stent systems decreased 109 million or 20 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 this decrease was primarily related to lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 continued average selling price declines in the us des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes our international drugeluting stent system net sales decreased 55 million or eight percent in 2013 as compared to the previous year due to continued lower market share related to competitive launches historically the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility we believe that we will continue to maintain a strong position within the worldwide

as compared to 2012 the yearoveryear increase in worldwide pi net sales was primarily driven by growth in our core pi franchise as a result of new product launches in stents and balloons as well as the launch of the vessix renal denervation system in europe  40during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of vessix a developer of catheterbased renal denervation systems for the

limited supply of sicd systems during the second and third quarters of 2013 we continued to make progress in our efforts to enhance the sicd supply chain and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we were able to resume our launch of our sicd systemnet sales from our crm products represent a significant source of our overall net sales therefore increases or decreases in our crm net sales could have a significant impact on the results of our consolidated operations variables that may impact the size of the crm market andor our share of that market include but are not limited toour ability to timely

include the blazer line of ablation catheters designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness our blazer line includes our next generation blazer prime ablation catheter and our blazer openirrigated catheter launched in select european countries worldwide net sales of our electrophysiology products were 155 million in 2013 as compared to 147 million in 2012 an increase of approximately 8 million or five percent excluding the 2 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our worldwide electrophysiology net sales increased 10 million or seven percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase in worldwide electrophysiology net sales was due to the acquisition of the electrophysiology business of cr bard inc which produced 15 million of sales during the fourth quarter of 2013during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of rhythmia medical inc a developer of nextgeneration mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter we received ce mark approval for the rhythmia technology during the second quarter of 2013 and received fda approval during july 2013 and expect to launch the product in 2014 on november 1 2013 we completed the acquisition of the electrophysiology business of cr bard inc bard ep we believe that this transaction brings a strong commercial team and complementary portfolio of ablation catheters diagnostic tools and electrophysiology recording systems and will allow us to better serve the global electrophysiology market through a more comprehensive portfolio offering and sales infrastructure we believe that the rhythmia and bard ep acquisitions as well as our other expected product launches will help to position us to participate more competitively in the fastgrowing electrophysiology marketmedsurgendoscopyour endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems our worldwide net sales of these products were 1300 billion in 2013 as compared to 1252 billion in 2012 an increase of 48 million or four percent excluding the 41 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our worldwide endoscopy net sales increased 89 million or seven percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 this performance was primarily the result of growth across several of our key product franchises including our hemostasis franchise on the continued adoption and utilization of our resolution clip for gastrointestinal bleeding our biliary device franchise driven by our endoscopic ultrasound platform and recent launches within our biliary access and retrieval product lines our metal stent franchise driven by our wallflex product family and improved adoption of the alair bronchial thermoplasty systemin 2010 we completed our acquisition of asthmatx inc which added to our endoscopy portfolio a lessinvasive catheterbased bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma the alair bronchial thermoplasty system developed by asthmatx has ce mark china food and drug administration and us fda approval and is the first devicebased asthma treatment approved by the fda beginning january 1 2013 the america medical association current procedural terminology editorial panel assigned category i cpt codes specifically for bronchial thermoplasty the category i cpt procedure codes are recognized by all public and private health insurance payers in the united states which will allow physicians and hospitals to seek reimbursement for bronchial thermoplasty procedures in addition during the third quarter of 2013 the fiveyear data from the air2 clinical trial were published in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology which showed that the alair system provided longterm asthma control demonstrated by a sustained reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations and emergency room visits over a five year period after treatment we expect that the alair technology will continue to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to future sales growth and diversification of the endoscopy business 42urology and womens healthour urology and womens health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders our worldwide net sales of these products were 505 million in 2013 as compared to 500 million in 2012 an increase of approximately 5 million or one percent excluding the 12 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our worldwide urology and womens health net sales increased 17 million or three percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase in worldwide urology and womens health net sales was primarily due to new product launches and growth in the international business as a result of our global commercial expansionneuromodulationour neuromodulation business offers the precision and precision spectratm spinal cord stimulator systems used for the management of chronic pain our worldwide net sales of neuromodulation products were 453 million in 2013 as compared to 367 million in 2012 an increase of 86 million or 23 percent excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 1 million our neuromodulation worldwide net sales in 2013 grew 24 percent as compared to the prior year the increase was primarily a result of strong sales of our precision spectra system we received ce mark approval for the precision spectra system during the fourth quarter of 2012 and we commenced our us commercial launch of the device during the first quarter of 2013 following fda approval the precision spectra system is the worlds first and only scs system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic painduring the third quarter of 2012 we received ce mark approval for use of our vercise deep brain stimulation system for the treatment of parkinsons disease in europe and we began our us pivotal trial for the treatment of parkinsons disease during the second quarter of 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we received ce mark approval for use of our vercise dbs system for the treatment of intractable primary and secondary dystonia we believe we have an exciting opportunity in dbs with the vercise dbs system which is designed to selectively stimulate targeted areas of the brain to customize therapy for patients and minimize side effects of unwanted stimulation emerging marketsas part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion described in item 1 of this annual report we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence including in emerging markets we define emerging markets as including certain developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions healthcare sectors and our global capabilities which currently include 20 countries we are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our emerging markets and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities our emerging markets revenue was approximately eight percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013 restructuring initiativeson an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success these initiatives are described below and additional information can be found in results of operations and note h  restructuringrelated activities to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report2014 restructuring planon october 22 2013 our board of directors approved and we committed to a restructuring initiative the 2014 restructuring plan the 2014 restructuring plan is intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments key activities under the plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes the pno strategy is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities other activities involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics these activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015 43we estimate that the 2014 restructuring plan will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 150 million to 200 million exiting 2015 and we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives we estimate that the implementation of the 2014 restructuring plan will result in total pretax charges of approximately 175 million to 225 million of which approximately 160 million to 210 million is expected to result in future cash outlays refer to results of operations for further details on our restructuring charges2011 restructuring planon july 26 2011 our board of directors approved and we committed to a restructuring initiative the 2011 restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies increase competitiveness and support new investments thereby increasing shareholder value key activities under the 2011 restructuring plan included standardizing and automating certain processes and activities relocating select administrative and functional activities rationalizing organizational reporting structures leveraging preferred vendors and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency among these efforts we expanded our ability to deliver bestinclass global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets this action was intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many costreducing and productivityenhancing opportunities in addition we undertook efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies on january 25 2013 our board of directors approved and we committed to an expansion of our 2011 restructuring plan the expansion was intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments key activities under the expansion included further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities relocate select administrative and functional activities rationalize organizational reporting structures expand shared services and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions in addition they included further efforts to streamline various corporate functions eliminate bureaucracy increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies the total 2011 restructuring plan including the expansion the total program reduced gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 360 million exiting 2013 a substantial portion of the total program savings were reinvested in targeted areas for future growth including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets key activities under the total program were substantially completed by the end of 2013 refer to results of operations for further details on our restructuring chargesneurovascular divestiturein january 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of 15 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 30 million during 2013 and received the final 10 million in january 2014 after the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement and also manufactured and supplied products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013 we recorded neurovascular revenue of 58 million during 2013 122 million during 2012 and 141 million during 2011 our sales related to our divested neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated we do not expect revenue from our divested neurovascular business to be significant in 2014 divestiturerelated gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance see results of operations and note c  divestitures for additional informationhealthcare reformthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 in 2013 we recorded 73 million within our selling general and administrative expenses other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesany changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally 44we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients in japan the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those proceduresresults of operationsnet saleseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business

2013 and 2012 net sales 45in 2012 we generated net sales of 7249 billion as compared to 7622 billion in 2011 a decrease of 373 million or five percent our net sales were unfavorably impacted by 123 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and sales related to our divested neurovascular business declined 19 million in 2012 excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses our net sales decreased 232 million or three percent as compared to the prior year this decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our interventional cardiology business of 266 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 average selling price declines in the des market as a result of competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes and declines in our crm net sales of 145 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the icd market lower average selling prices and lower volumes these decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales during 2012 from our endoscopy business of 84 million from our peripheral interventions business of 56 million and net sales from our neuromodulation business of 32 million as compared to 2011gross profitour gross profit was 4969 billion in 2013 4900 billion in 2012 and 4963 billion in 2011 as a percentage of net sales our gross profit increased to 696 percent in 2013 as compared to 676 percent in 2012 and 651 percent in 2011 the following is a reconciliation of our

current year696 676 the increase in our gross profit margin for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross profit margin was also positively impacted by lower sales related to our divested businesses as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins in addition during the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a 16 million credit to cost of products sold related to the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems this credit is included in the all other caption in the table above partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing and sales mix related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products the main factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin during 2012 as compared to 2011 was the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our 2012 to 2011 comparison of gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product

higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by our increased investment related to acquisitions strategic growth initiatives and our expansion efforts in emerging markets as well as 73 million of expense associated with the new excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices that went into effect january 1 2013 partially offsetting these increases were declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2012 our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates research and development rampd expensesin 2013 our rampd expenses decreased 25 million or approximately three percent as compared to 2012 and were 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease was due primarily to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offsetting the decrease was rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions royalty expensein 2013 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or nine percent as compared to 2012 and was ten basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessamortization expenseour amortization expense was 410 million in 2013 as compared to 395 million in 2012 an increase of 15 million or four percent this increase was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of bridgepoint rhythmia and vessix which all took place in the fourth quarter of 2012 and electrophysiology business or cr bard inc which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013  47amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquiditygoodwill impairment chargeseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes we identified the following new global reporting units effective as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation refer to critical accounting estimates for further discussion of the reorganization and the resulting global reporting units the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units for our 2012 and prior impairment assessments we identified i six reporting units within the us which included our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate made up the us reportable segment and ii four international reporting units including emea consisting of europe middle east and africa japan asia pacific and the americas 2013 chargewe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units the fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit the global crm reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global crm reporting unit was 4636 billion as of january 1 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 we tested the global crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impairedthe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge we finalized the second step of the global crm goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required after recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013 there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global crm basis pursuant to our new organizational structure we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of the global crm reporting unit we completed a dcf model associated with our new global crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows tax attributes the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc of approximately 12 percent 48in the second quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except crm for which no goodwill remains therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates of this item 7 for further discussion of our crmrelated intangible assets2012 chargesduring the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measuresin the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points 2011 chargebased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 49intangible asset impairment charges2013 chargesduring the third quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projectsand our indefinite lived core technology assets and recorded no impairments based on the results of our testing these indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies described in note a  significant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual reportduring the second quarter of 2013 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual

tax ratethe change in our reported tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 and 2011 relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate in 2013 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges acquisition and divestiturerelated net charges litigation and restructuringrelated charges and debt extinguishment charges our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied in 2012 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges acquisition and divestiturerelated net credits and litigation and restructuringrelated charges our reported tax rate for 2012 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2013 and 2012 the change in our reported tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business in 2011 these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the neurovascular business a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated charges and credits our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets changes in various state tax laws the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and the finalization of our 2010 us federal tax returnwe have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 53liquidity and capital resourcesas of december 31 2013 we had 217 million of cash and cash equivalents

of approximately 300 million to the us department of justice in 2011 and lower taxrelated net cash outflows of approximately 40 million during 2012 partially offsetting these items was the impact of

technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 607 million as of december 31 2013 and 491 million as of december 31 2012 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical 58revenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value 59valuation of crmrelated amortizable intangible assetscertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our crm business 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life for purposes of testing the crmrelated amortizable intangible assets we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global crm reporting unit as a result of having identified the crm reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our crm core technology which is the primary asset within the crm asset group is utilized by all crm revenuegenerating products as a result we include cash flows generated by our crm products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life which is estimated to end in 2031 we determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business our core technology represents knowhow patented and unpatented technology testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future crm product generations this core technology includes battery and capacitor technology lead technology software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue expenses and capital expenditures which are based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates these future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the crm reporting units product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology the increased impact to the crm reporting unit from emerging markets and demographic trends toward an aging population further while our crm revenue has declined over the last three years as a result of factors specific to our crm business and contraction in the overall crm market we believe our crm revenue will return to low growth over the remaining useful life of our crm amortizing intangible assets events specific to our crm business included the 2010 product ship hold actions and resulting market share losses and lower replacement volumes due to historical product recalls we believe that the contraction in the crm market was primarily due to lower procedural volumes principally due to a focus on appropriate device usage and increased pressure on selling prices however we believe that there has been a recent trend toward stabilization in procedural volumes across the marketwe continue to perform thorough reviews of the crm market and our recent business results within the market and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful lifegoodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulationto determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units on a relative fair value basis we reallocated 1764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific japan and americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units in addition we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former us divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit the 2380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit was reallocated between the new global interventional cardiology and global peripheral interventions reporting units on a relative fair value basis  60we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2013 2012 and 2011 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 61we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in procedural volumes pricing pressures reductions in reimbursement levels product actions andor competitive or disruptive technology developmentsdeclines in our market

chargesincome taxeswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for

informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united statesthe gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this nongaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules 63management uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performancewe believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income and adjusted net income per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  this amount represents a a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013 b noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second quarter of

attributable to our former emea reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012 and e noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second and third quarters of 2012 we remove the impact of noncash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityacquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments consist of a contingent consideration fair value adjustments b due diligence other fees and exit costs and c separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments due diligence other fees and exit costs include legal tax severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancerestructuring and

nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceamortization expense  amortization expense is a noncash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation accordingly management has excluded amortization

the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange ratessales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and

26 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon s ernst amp young llpboston massachusettsfebruary 26 2014 68item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures furthermore we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positionsour currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of 4516 billion as of december 31 2013 and 4411 billion as of december 31 2012 we recorded 264 million of other assets and 55 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2013 as compared to 121 million of other assets and 57 million of other liabilities as of december 31 2012 a ten percent appreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by 257 million as of december 31 2013 and 270 million as of december 31 2012 a ten percent depreciation in the us dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by 314 million as of december 31 2013 and by 319 million as of december 31 2012 any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operationsour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixedrate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floatingrate debt we recorded 1 million of other assets and 8 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december 31 2013 we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2012 a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments fair value by 41 million as of december 31 2013 a onepercentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments fair value by 37 million as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 3393 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates representing approximately 80 percent of our total debtsee note e  fair value measurements to our 2013 consolidated financial statements

whollyowned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions we assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie  for any vies we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest in a vie the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both 1 the power to direct activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on our assessments under the applicable guidance we did not have significant interests in any vies and therefore did not consolidate any vies during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011on january 3 2011 we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation stryker due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the neurovascular business following the divestiture the divestiture did not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation and therefore the results of the neurovascular business are included in our results of operations for all periods presented refer to note c  divestitures for a description of this business divestiturebasis of presentationthe accompanying

commitments and contingencies for more informationaccounting estimatesto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2013 2012 and 2011  76concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 12 million in 2013 7 million in 2012 and 13 million in 2011 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2013 2012 or 2011 or accounts receivable at december 31 2013 or 2012 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding above historical levels prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2013 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase as of december 31 2013 our net receivables in these countries greater than 180 days past due totaled approximately 95 million of which approximately 50 million were past due greater than 360 days  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price methodwe generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 77warranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2013 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following in millions  year ended december 31  2013 2012 2011beginning balance 26 30

obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 279 million in 2013 288 million in 2012 and 296 million in 2011valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones  78indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization primarily include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisitionwe test our inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination for impairment at least annually during the third quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2013 2012 and 2011 79for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2013 2012 and 2011 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 80if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for discussion of our goodwill impairment chargesinvestments in publicly traded and privately held entitieswe account for our publicly traded investments as availableforsale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we account for our investments in privately held entities for which fair value is not readily determinable in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements the book value of investments that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting was 18 million as of december 31 2013 and 16 million as of december 31 2012 we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the aggregate carrying amount of our cost method investments was 20 million as of december 31 2013 and 13 million as of december 31 2012 in addition we had notes receivable from certain companies of 13 million as of december 31 2013 and 5 million as of december 31 2012each reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have

calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions

certain governmental investigations which could result in substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims we generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for general product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range we analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the

2012 respectively during the third quarter of 2013 we reclassified approximately 45 million of core technology not previously subject to amortization to amortizable intangible assets due to projected changes in the market for this technology we tested the intangible asset for impairment prior to this reclassification and determined that the asset was not impaired 2013 reorganizationwe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component effective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units effective as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units for our 2012 and 2011 assessments we identified i six reporting units within the us which included our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises and ii four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americasto determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units on a relative fair value basis we reallocated 1764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific japan and americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units in addition we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former us divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit the 2380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit was reallocated between the new global interventional cardiology and global peripheral interventions reporting units on a relative fair value basis  91the following represents our goodwill balance by

quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units the fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit the global crm reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global crm reporting unit was 4636 billion as of january 1 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other we tested the global crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impairedthe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge we finalized the second step of the global crm goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required after recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013 there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unitthe goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global crm basis pursuant to our new organizational structure we used the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of the global crm reporting unit we completed a dcf model associated with our new global crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows tax attributes the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc of approximately 12 percent 92in the second quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except crm for which no goodwill remains therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited

or more of these factors among others could result in additional impairment charges 932012 chargesin the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalizationin the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization2011 chargebased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 the following is a rollforward of accumulated goodwill

combinations that are fundamental to the ongoing operations of our business and have no limit to their useful life our technologyrelated intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are comprised primarily of certain acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine we assess our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other 96note e  fair value measurementsderivative instruments and hedging activitieswe develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use both derivative instruments currency forward and option contracts and nonderivative transactions primarily european manufacturing and distribution operations to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changesdesignated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 2564 billion as of december 31 2013 and 2469 billion as of december 31 2012we recognized net gains of 36 million during 2013 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 39 million of net losses during 2012 and 95 million of net losses during 2011 all currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2013 mature within 36 months as of december 31 2013 139 million of net gains net of tax were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of any currency derivative instruments that are or previously were designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges as compared to net gains of 31 million as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 75 million of net gains net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 1952 billion as of december 31 2013 and 1942 billion as of december 31 2012 97interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt or fixedrate debt into floatingrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time in the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges and had 450 million outstanding as of december 31 2013 we assessed at inception and reassess on an ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt we recognized in interest expense a 7 million gain on our hedged debt obligation and an 8 million loss on the related interest rate derivative contract during 2013 resulting in a 1 million net loss recorded in earnings due to ineffectiveness we had no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012in prior years we terminated certain interest rate derivative contracts including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and floatingtofixed treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges we amortize the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 54 million as of december 31 2013 and 64 million as of december 31 2012 and unamortized losses of 2 million as of december 31 2013 and 3 million as of december 31 2012 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated floatingtofixed treasury locks of 3 million as of december 31 2013 and 4 million as of december 31 2012 the gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 10 million in 2013 11 million in 2012 and were not material in 2011 as of december 31 2013 9 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agencywe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant 98fair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our

or liabilities on the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value generally we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2013 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy prescribed by topic 820 as discussed below because these observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of our derivative instruments 99the

liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices where available where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value topic 820 establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2  inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and

carryforwards and the federal benefit of uncertain tax positionswe reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years  112significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows  as of december 31 in millions 2013 2012 deferred tax assets    inventory

as compared to 184 million as of december 31 2012 in addition we had foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits the tax effect of which was 313 million as of december 31 2013 as compared to 341 million as of december 31 2012 these tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2014 after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 299 million as of december 31 2013 and 316 million as of december 31 2012 the decrease in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 is attributable primarily due to greater than expected net operating loss utilization as well as a change in judgment related to expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income was a charge of 72 million in 2013 a charge of 43 million in 2012 and a benefit of 1 million in 2011 113we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations we do not believe it is practicable to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations due to the complexities of this calculation unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations were 11902 billion as of december 31 2013 and 11041 billion as of december 31 2012we obtain tax incentives through free trade zone regime offered in costa rica which allows 100 exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50 exemption in the following four years this tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of 6 million 7 million and 2 million for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax incentive for 100 exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2015 the impact of per share earnings is immaterial for 2013 2012 and 2011as of december 31 2013 we had 1069 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 939 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of december 31 2012 we had 1052 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 902 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions  year ended december 31  2013 2012

multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state local and foreign income tax matters through 2003we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 114we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 402 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2013 and 364 million as of december 31 2012 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 38 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 22 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2013 recognized 34 million in 2012 and released 18 million in 2011it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 27 millionin september 2013 treasury and the internal revenue service issued final regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property under internal revenue code sections irc 162 167 and 263a these regulations apply to amounts paid to acquire produce or improve tangible property as well as dispositions of such property the general effective date is tax years beginning on or after january 1 2014 we have evaluated these regulations and determined that they will not have a material impact on our results of operations note k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquiditywe record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable in accordance with asc topic 450 contingencies we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for general product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range 115our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 607 million as of december 31 2013 and 491 million as of december 31 2012 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense the increase in our legal accrual was primarily due to litigationrelated charges recorded during the year during 2013 2012 and 2011 we recorded litigationrelated charges in the amount of 221 million 192 million and 48 million respectively we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantsin managements opinion we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below which individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operations andor cash flows unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be estimatedpatent litigation on september 22 2009 cordis corporation cordis llc and wyeth corporation

forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stockbased award we have applied based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures a weightedaverage annual forfeiture rate of approximately nine percent to all unvested stockbased awards as of december 31 2013 which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period we reevaluate this
