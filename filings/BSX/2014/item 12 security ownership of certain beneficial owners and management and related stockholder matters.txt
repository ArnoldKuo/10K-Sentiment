stryker corporation for a purchase price of 15 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 30 million during 2013 and received the final 10 million in january 2014 after the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement and also manufactured and supplied products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013 we recorded neurovascular revenue of 58 million during 2013 122 million during 2012 and 141 million during 2011 our sales related to our divested neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated we do not expect revenue from our divested neurovascular business to be significant in 2014 divestiturerelated gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance see results of operations and note c  divestitures for additional informationhealthcare reformthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 in 2013 we recorded 73 million within our selling general and administrative expenses other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesany changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally 44we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients in japan the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those proceduresresults of operationsnet saleseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business

2013 and 2012 net sales 45in 2012 we generated net sales of 7249 billion as compared to 7622 billion in 2011 a decrease of 373 million or five percent our net sales were unfavorably impacted by 123 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and sales related to our divested neurovascular business declined 19 million in 2012 excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses our net sales decreased 232 million or three percent as compared to the prior year this decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our interventional cardiology business of 266 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 average selling price declines in the des market as a result of competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes and declines in our crm net sales of 145 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the icd market lower average selling prices and lower volumes these decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales during 2012 from our endoscopy business of 84 million from our peripheral interventions business of 56 million and net sales from our neuromodulation business of 32 million as compared to 2011gross profitour gross profit was 4969 billion in 2013 4900 billion in 2012 and

current year696 676 the increase in our gross profit margin for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross profit margin was also positively impacted by lower sales related to our divested businesses as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins in addition during the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a 16 million credit to cost of products sold related to the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems this credit is included in the all other caption in the table above partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing and sales mix related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products the main factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin during 2012 as compared to 2011 was the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our 2012 to 2011 comparison of gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product

higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by our increased investment related to acquisitions strategic growth initiatives and our expansion efforts in emerging markets as well as 73 million of expense associated with the new excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices that went into effect january 1 2013 partially offsetting these increases were declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2012 our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates research and development rampd expensesin 2013 our rampd expenses decreased 25 million or approximately three percent as compared to 2012 and were 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease was due primarily to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offsetting the decrease was rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions royalty expensein 2013 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or nine percent as compared to 2012 and was ten basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessamortization expenseour amortization expense was 410 million in 2013 as compared to 395 million in 2012 an increase of 15 million or four percent this increase was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of bridgepoint rhythmia and vessix which all took place in the fourth quarter of 2012 and electrophysiology business or cr bard inc which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013  47amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquiditygoodwill impairment chargeseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes we identified the following new global reporting units effective as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation refer to critical accounting estimates for further discussion of the reorganization and the resulting global reporting units the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units for our 2012 and prior impairment assessments we identified i six reporting units within the us which included our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate made up the us reportable segment and ii four international reporting units including emea consisting of europe middle east and africa japan asia pacific and the americas 2013 chargewe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units the fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit the global crm reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global crm reporting unit was 4636 billion as of january 1 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 we tested the global crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impairedthe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge we finalized the second step of the global crm goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required after recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013 there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global crm basis pursuant to our new organizational structure we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of the global crm reporting unit we completed a dcf model associated with our new global crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows tax attributes the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc of approximately 12 percent 48in the second quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except crm for which no goodwill remains therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates of this item 7 for further discussion of our crmrelated intangible assets2012 chargesduring the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measuresin the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points 2011 chargebased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 49intangible asset impairment charges2013 chargesduring the third quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projectsand our indefinite lived core technology assets and recorded no impairments based on the results of our testing these indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies described in note a  significant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual reportduring the second quarter of 2013 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with certain of our acquisitions based on the results of our impairment analyses we revised our expectations of the market size related to sadra and the resulting timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows associated with the technology acquired from sadra as a result of these changes we recorded pretax impairment charges of 51 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2013 during the second quarter of 2013 we also recorded an additional 2 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the amount of the expected cash flows related to certain other acquired inprocess research and development projects2012 chargesduring the third quarter of 2012 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projects and our indefinite lived core technology assets based on the results of our annual test we recorded total impairment charges of 13 million to writedown the balances of certain inprocess projects to their fair value these charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an inprocess project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an inprocess projectduring the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc based on our impairment analysis we revised our expectations of the required effort time and cost involved in completing the inprocess projects and bringing the related products to market as a result of these changes we recorded an impairment charge of 129 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012 2011 chargesduring the third quarter of 2011 we recorded a 9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain inprocess research and development projects intangible asset impairment charges are noncash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquiditycontingent consideration expensecertain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones including attaining specified revenue levels achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals in accordance with us gaap we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestoneswe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of 4 million in 2013 a net benefit of 6 million in 2012 and a net expense of 7 million in 2011 contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating performance see note b  acquisitions to our 2013

debt extinguishment charges our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied in 2012 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges acquisition and divestiturerelated net credits and litigation and restructuringrelated charges our reported tax rate for 2012 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2013 and 2012 the change in our reported tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business in 2011 these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the neurovascular business a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated charges and credits our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets changes in various state tax laws the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and the finalization of our 2010 us federal tax returnwe have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 53liquidity and capital resourcesas of december 31 2013 we had 217 million of cash and cash equivalents

activities 5967441728operating activitiesduring 2013 we generated 1082 billion from operating activities as compared to 1260 billion in 2012 a decrease of 178 million this reduction was primarily due to the impact of increased levels of accounts receivable of approximately 100 million payments related to debt extinguishment of approximately 70 million and net payments associated with litigation of approximately 50 million partially offset by a final cash receipt associated with our promus supply agreement with abbottduring 2012 we generated 1260 billion from operating activities as compared to 1008 billion in 2011 an increase of 252 million this increase was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventory reductions which generated 103 million the impact of litigationrelated payments of approximately 300 million to the us department of justice in 2011 and lower taxrelated net cash outflows of approximately 40 million during 2012 partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower operating profit in 2012 and a 35 million increase in restructuringrelated payments as compared to 2011 our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately

region we estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the inprocess research and development projects acquired in 20112013 is between 200 million and 250 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2014 through 2018 following the respective launches of these technologies in the us europe and japan regions certain of our acquisitions also

prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2013 57legal mattersthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 607 million as of december 31 2013 and 491 million as of december 31 2012 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical 58revenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value 59valuation of crmrelated amortizable intangible assetscertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our crm business 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life for purposes of testing the crmrelated amortizable intangible assets we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global crm reporting unit as a result of having identified the crm reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our crm core technology which is the primary asset within the crm asset group is utilized by all crm revenuegenerating products as a result we include cash flows generated by our crm products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life which is estimated to end in 2031 we determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business our core technology represents knowhow patented and unpatented technology testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future crm product generations this core technology includes battery and capacitor technology lead technology software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue expenses and capital expenditures which are based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates these future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the crm reporting units product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology the increased impact to the crm reporting unit from emerging markets and demographic trends toward an aging population further while our crm revenue has declined over the last three years as a result of factors specific to our crm business and contraction in the overall crm market we believe our crm revenue will return to low growth over the remaining useful life of our crm amortizing intangible assets events specific to our crm business included the 2010 product ship hold actions and resulting market share losses and lower replacement volumes due to historical product recalls we believe that the contraction in the crm market was primarily due to lower procedural volumes principally due to a focus on appropriate device usage and increased pressure on selling prices however we believe that there has been a recent trend toward stabilization in procedural volumes across the marketwe continue to perform thorough reviews of the crm market and our recent business results within the market and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful lifegoodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulationto determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units on a relative fair value basis we reallocated 1764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific japan and americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units in addition we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former us divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit the 2380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit was reallocated between the new global interventional cardiology and global peripheral interventions reporting units on a relative fair value basis  60we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2013 2012 and 2011 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 61we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in procedural volumes pricing pressures reductions in reimbursement levels product actions andor competitive or disruptive technology developmentsdeclines in our market

chargesincome taxeswe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results 62we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based

informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united statesthe gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this nongaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules 63management uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performancewe believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income and adjusted net income per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  this amount represents a a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013 b noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second quarter of 2013 c a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former us cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012 d a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former emea reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012 and e noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second and third quarters of 2012 we remove the impact of noncash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityacquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments consist of a contingent consideration fair value adjustments b due diligence other fees and exit costs and c separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments due diligence other fees and exit costs include legal tax severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancerestructuring and restructuringrelated charges  these adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our 2014 restructuring program and 2011 restructuring program these costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past

in assessing our operating performance as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 64discrete tax items  these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges acquisition divestiture restructuring or litigationrelated charges or credits these adjustments do not reflect expected ongoing operating results accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancedebt extinguishment charge  this item represents premiums accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of 1450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013 these adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceamortization expense  amortization expense is a noncash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation accordingly management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityrevenue growth rates excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange ratessales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict accordingly management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceadjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as the sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable gaap financial measures further other companies may calculate these nongaap financial measures differently than we do which may limit the

during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates refer to critical accounting estimates included in item 7 of this annual report for further discussioncash and cash equivalentswe record cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at cost which approximates fair value our policy is to invest excess cash in shortterm marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalentswe record availableforsale investments at fair value and exclude unrealized gains and temporary losses on availableforsale securities from earnings reporting such gains and losses net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we held no availableforsale securities during 2013 2012 and 2011  76concentrations of credit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents derivative financial instrument contracts and accounts and notes receivable our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions counterparties to financial instruments expose us to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance we transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure we provide credit in the normal course of business to hospitals healthcare agencies clinics doctors offices and other private and governmental institutions and generally do not require collateral we record our accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets at net realizable value we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical information and managements best estimates amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against this reserve we recorded writeoffs of uncollectible accounts receivable of 12 million in 2013 7 million in 2012 and 13 million in 2011 we are not dependent on any single institution and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2013 2012 or 2011 or accounts receivable at december 31 2013 or 2012 however large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our us net saleswe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks including those that may arise from economic conditions in both the us and international economies our european sales to governmentowned or supported customers in southern europe specifically greece italy spain and portugal are subject to an increased number of days outstanding above historical levels prior to payment historically receivable balances with certain publiclyowned hospitals in these countries accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december 31 2013 if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our writeoffs of uncollectible amounts may increase as of december 31 2013 our net receivables in these countries greater than 180 days past due totaled approximately 95 million of which approximately 50 million were past due greater than 360 days  revenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of singleuse medical devices and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force in certain international markets we sell our products through independent distributors we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage or implant which indicates that the sale is complete many of our cardiac rhythm management crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price methodwe generally allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customerwe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 77warranty obligationswe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings the majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our crm business which include defibrillator and pacemaker systems our crm products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices we offer a full warranty for a portion of the period postimplant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter we estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessarychanges in our product warranty accrual during 2013 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following in millions  year ended december 31  2013 2012 2011beginning balance 26 30

obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventory approximately 40 percent of our finished goods inventory as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was at customer locations pursuant to consignment arrangements or held by sales representativesproperty plant and equipmentwe state property plant equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset we provide for depreciation using the straightline method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings and improvements over a 20 to 40 year life equipment furniture and fixtures over a three to ten year life and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease depreciation expense was 279 million in 2013 288 million in 2012 and 296 million in 2011valuation of business combinationswe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition including identifiable intangible assets and inprocess research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through selling general and administrative costsin those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones  78indefinitelived intangibles including inprocess research and developmentour indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization primarily include acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional medicine and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination our inprocess research and development represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility regardless of whether they have alternative future use the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region we classify inprocess research and development acquired in a business combination as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts upon completion of the associated research and development efforts we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives upon permanent abandonment we would writeoff the remaining carrying amount of the associated inprocess research and development intangible asset we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair valuewe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our inprocess research and development this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes expected market growth rates expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share in arriving at the value of the inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of other acquired assets the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology we apply a marketparticipant riskadjusted discount rate to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisitionwe test our inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in a business combination for impairment at least annually during the third quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired for asset purchases outside of business combinations we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date amortization and impairment of intangible assetswe record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives we use a straightline method of amortization unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined the approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows patents and licenses two to 20 years definitelived technologyrelated five to 25 years customer relationships five to 25 years other intangible assets variouswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life conditions that may indicate impairment include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability for purposes of the recoverability test we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for more information related to impairments of intangible assets during 2013 2012 and 2011 79for patents developed internally we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents including attorney fees registration fees consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent goodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2013 2012 and 2011 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 80if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test see note d  goodwill and other intangible assets for discussion of our goodwill impairment chargesinvestments in publicly traded and privately held entitieswe account for our publicly traded investments as availableforsale securities based on the quoted market price at the end of the reporting period we compute realized gains and losses on sales of availableforsale securities based on the average cost method adjusted for any otherthantemporary declines in fair value we account for our investments in privately held entities for which fair value is not readily determinable in accordance with asc topic 323 investments  equity method and joint ventures we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a vie in which we are the primary beneficiary we record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements the book value of investments that we accounted for under the equity method of accounting was 18 million as of december 31 2013 and 16 million as of december 31 2012 we account for investments in entities in which we have less than a 20 percent ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee the aggregate carrying amount of our cost method investments was 20 million as of december 31 2013 and 13 million as of december 31 2012 in addition we had notes receivable from certain companies of 13 million as of december 31 2013 and 5 million as of december 31 2012each reporting period we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment examples of such impairment indicators include but are not limited to a significant deterioration in earnings performance recent financing rounds at reduced valuations a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern if we identify an impairment indicator we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value our estimation of fair value considers all available financial information related to the investee including valuations based on recent thirdparty equity investments in the investee if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is impaired and we make a determination as to whether the impairment is otherthantemporary we deem an impairment to be otherthantemporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a period sufficient for a market recovery up to the carrying value of the investment further evidence must indicate that the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period for otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value impairment losses on our investments are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operationsincome taxeswe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets we consider relevant evidence both positive and negative to determine the need for a valuation allowance information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future yearswe do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations it is not practicable to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations are 11902 billion as of december 31 2013 and 11041 billion as of december 31 2012 81we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in our opinion we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit although we believe our estimates are reasonable the final outcome of open tax matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results see note j  income taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balanceslegal and product liability costswe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings including intellectual property breach of contract securities litigation and product liability suits in some cases the claimants seek damages as well as other relief which if granted could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products we are also the subject of certain governmental investigations which could result in substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims we generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable we accrue anticipated costs of settlement damages losses for general product liability claims and under certain conditions costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable otherwise we expense these costs as incurred if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely we accrue the minimum amount of the range we analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement we allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit see note k  commitments and contingencies for discussion of our individual material legal proceedingscosts associated with exit activitieswe record employee termination costs in accordance with asc topic 712 compensation  nonretirement and postemployment benefits if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement which includes benefits provided as part of our domestic severance policy or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements we accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered the rights to the benefits have vested the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability we account for employee termination benefits that represent a onetime benefit in accordance with asc topic 420 exit or disposal cost obligations we record such costs into expense over the employees future service period if any other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased and impairments of longlived assets and are expensed in accordance with asc topic 420 and asc topic 360 property plant and equipmenttranslation of foreign currencywe translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries from local currency into us dollars using the yearend exchange rate and translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year we show the net effect of these translation adjustments in our consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for any significant foreign subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies we would remeasure their financial statements as if the functional currency were the us dollar we did not record any highly inflationary economy translation adjustments in 2013 2012 or 2011foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other net in our consolidated statements of operations net of losses and gains from any related derivative financial instruments we recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of 11 million in 2013 18 million in 2012 and 12 million in 2011 82financial instrumentswe recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our financial statements in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815 refer to note e  fair value measurements for more information on our derivative instrumentsshipping and

2012 respectively during the third quarter of 2013 we reclassified approximately 45 million of core technology not previously subject to amortization to amortizable intangible assets due to projected changes in the market for this technology we tested the intangible asset for impairment prior to this reclassification and determined that the asset was not impaired 2013 reorganizationwe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component effective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units effective as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units for our 2012 and

interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises and ii four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americasto determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units on a relative fair value basis we reallocated 1764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific japan and americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units in addition we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former us divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit the 2380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit

quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units the fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit the global crm reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global crm reporting unit was 4636 billion as of january 1 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other we tested the global crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impairedthe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge we finalized the second step of the global crm goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required after recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013 there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unitthe goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global crm basis pursuant to our new organizational structure we used the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of the global crm reporting unit we completed a dcf model associated with our new global crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows tax attributes the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc of approximately 12 percent 92in the second quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except crm for which no goodwill remains therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testingon a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited

reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalizationin the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us cardiac rhythm management us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization2011 chargebased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible

comprised primarily of certain acquired balloon and other technology which is foundational to our continuing operations within the cardiovascular market and other markets within interventional

the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset

intangiblesgoodwill and other 96note e  fair value measurementsderivative instruments and hedging activitieswe develop manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies we recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging in accordance with topic 815 for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments the hedging instrument must be designated based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings or cash flows to material risk as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset losses and gains on the item being hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and we do not have any nonderivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments pursuant to topic 815currency hedgingwe are exposed to currency risk consisting primarily of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and thirdparty transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on a consolidated basis to take advantage of offsetting transactions we use both derivative instruments currency forward and option contracts and nonderivative transactions primarily european manufacturing and distribution operations to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows associated with these foreign currency denominated balances and transactions will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate changesdesignated foreign currency hedgesall of our designated currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 were cash flow hedges under topic 815 intended to protect the us dollar value of our forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of foreign currency cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income until the related thirdparty transaction occurs once the related thirdparty transaction occurs we reclassify the effective portion of any related gain or loss on the foreign currency cash flow hedge to earnings in the event the hedged forecasted transaction does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to earnings at that time we had currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding in the contract amount of 2564 billion as of december 31 2013 and 2469 billion as of december 31 2012we recognized net gains of 36 million during 2013 on our cash flow hedges as compared to 39 million of net losses during 2012 and 95 million of net losses during 2011 all currency cash flow hedges outstanding as of december 31 2013 mature within 36 months as of december 31 2013 139 million of net gains net of tax were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to recognize the effective portion of the fair value of any currency derivative instruments that are or previously were designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges as compared to net gains of 31 million as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 75 million of net gains net of tax may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve monthsthe success of our hedging program depends in part on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies primarily japanese yen euro british pound sterling australian dollar and canadian dollar we may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent that there are differences between forecasted and actual activity during periods of currency volatility in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flowsnondesignated foreign currency contractswe use currency forward contracts as a part of our strategy to manage exposure related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities these currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges under topic 815 are markedtomarket with changes in fair value recorded to earnings and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures generally less than one year we had currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges under topic 815 outstanding in the contract amount of 1952 billion as of december 31 2013 and 1942 billion as of december 31 2012 97interest rate hedgingour interest rate risk relates primarily to us dollar borrowings partially offset by us dollar cash investments we have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates by converting floatingrate debt into fixedrate debt or fixedrate debt into floatingrate debtwe designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges under topic 815 we record changes in the value of fair value hedges in interest expense which is generally offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligation interest payments made or received related to our interest rate derivative instruments are included in interest expense we record the effective portion of any change in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as unrealized gains or losses in oci net of tax until the hedged cash flow occurs at which point the effective portion of any gain or loss is reclassified to earnings we record the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges in interest expense in the event the hedged cash flow does not occur or it becomes no longer probable that it will occur we reclassify the amount of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge to interest expense at that time in the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of 450 million to convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt which we designated as fair value hedges and had 450 million outstanding as of december 31 2013 we assessed at inception and reassess on an ongoing basis whether the interest rate derivative contracts are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate debt we recognized in interest expense a 7 million gain on our hedged debt obligation and an 8 million loss on the related interest rate derivative contract during 2013 resulting in a 1 million net loss recorded in earnings due to ineffectiveness we had no interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2012in prior years we terminated certain interest rate derivative contracts including fixedtofloating interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges and floatingtofixed treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges we amortize the gains and losses of these derivative instruments upon termination into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged debt in accordance with topic 815 the carrying amount of certain of our senior notes included unamortized gains of 54 million as of december 31 2013 and 64 million as of december 31 2012 and unamortized losses of 2 million as of december 31 2013 and 3 million as of december 31 2012 related to the fixedtofloating interest rate contracts in addition we had pretax net gains within aoci related to terminated floatingtofixed treasury locks of 3 million as of december 31 2013 and 4 million as of december 31 2012 the gains that we recognized in earnings related to previously terminated interest rate derivatives were 10 million in 2013 11 million in 2012 and were not material in 2011 as of december 31 2013 9 million of net gains may be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months from amortization of our previously terminated interest rate derivative contractscounterparty credit riskwe do not have significant concentrations of credit risk arising from our derivative financial instruments whether from an individual counterparty or a related group of counterparties we manage our concentration of counterparty credit risk on our derivative instruments by limiting acceptable counterparties to a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of credit exposure to each counterparty and by actively monitoring their credit ratings and outstanding fair values on an ongoing basis furthermore none of our derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agencywe also employ master netting arrangements that reduce our counterparty payment settlement risk on any given maturity date to the net amount of any receipts or payments due between us and the counterparty financial institution thus the maximum loss due to credit risk by counterparty is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts net of any unrealized losses should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted although these protections do not eliminate concentrations of credit risk as a result of the above considerations we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant 98fair value of derivative instrumentsthe following presents the effect of our

or liabilities on the balance sheet we determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using the framework prescribed by asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures by considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date and by taking into account current interest rates foreign currency exchange rates the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and our creditworthiness for liabilities in certain instances we may utilize financial models to measure fair value generally we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means as of december 31 2013 we have classified all of our derivative assets and liabilities within

based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value the three levels of the hierarchy are defined as followslevel 1  inputs to the valuation methodology are

compared to 341 million as of december 31 2012 these tax attributes will expire periodically beginning in 2014 after consideration of all positive and negative evidence we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we established a valuation allowance of 299 million as of december 31 2013 and 316 million as of december 31 2012 the decrease in the valuation allowance as of december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 is attributable primarily due to greater than expected net operating loss utilization as well as a change in judgment related to expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets the income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income was a charge of 72 million in 2013 a charge of 43 million in 2012 and a benefit of 1 million in 2011 113we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations we do not believe it is practicable to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations due to the complexities of this calculation unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations were 11902 billion as of december 31 2013 and 11041 billion as of december 31 2012we obtain tax incentives through free trade zone regime offered in costa rica which allows 100 exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations and 50 exemption in the following four years this tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of 6 million 7 million and 2 million for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the tax incentive for 100 exemption from income tax is expected to expire in 2015 the impact of per share earnings is immaterial for 2013 2012 and 2011as of december 31 2013 we had 1069 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 939 million if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of december 31 2012 we had 1052 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which a net 902

multiple state and foreign jurisdictions we have concluded all us federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state local and foreign income tax matters through 2003we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 114we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense we had 402 million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of december 31 2013 and 364 million as of december 31 2012 the increase in gross interest and penalties was the result of 38 million recognized in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized 22 million of interest and penalties related to income taxes in 2013 recognized 34 million in 2012 and released 18 million in 2011it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues including transfer pricing and transactional related issues with foreign federal and state taxing authorities in which case we could record a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to 27 millionin september 2013 treasury and the internal revenue service issued final regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property under internal revenue code sections irc 162 167 and 263a these regulations apply to amounts paid to acquire produce or improve tangible property as well as dispositions of such property the general effective date is tax years beginning on or after january 1 2014 we have evaluated these regulations and determined that they will not have a material impact on our results of operations note k  commitments and contingenciesthe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to

2013 awards and january 1 2012 and ending december 31 2012 for the 2012 awards the number of performancebased dsus as to which the performance criteria under this program shall be determined to have been satisfied will be in a range of 0 to 150 of the target number of performancebased dsus awarded to the participant in addition award recipients must remain employed by us throughout a threeyear service period inclusive of the performance period to attain the full amount of performancebased dsus that satisfied the performance criteriawe determined the fair value of the 2013 fcf awards to be approximately 9 million based on the closing stock price at december 31 2013 and an achievement of approximately 100 of the target payout which is subject to approval by the executive compensation and human resources committee of our board of directors the per unit fair value is 1202 which is the closing stock price on december 31 2013 we determined the fair value of the 2012 fcf awards to be approximately 7 million and the per unit fair value was 573we recognize the expense on these awards in our consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period which is three years after the

upon death or disability of the participant in addition our stock grants to employees provide for accelerated vesting of our stockbased awards other than marketbased awards upon retirement in accordance with the terms of our stock grants for employees who will become retirement eligible prior to the vest date we expense stockbased awards other than marketbased awards over the greater of one year or the period between grant date and retirementeligibility the marketbased awards discussed above do not contain provisions that would accelerate the full vesting of the awards upon retirementeligibilitywe recognize stockbased compensation expense for the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest asc topic 718 compensation  stock compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stockbased award we have applied based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures a weightedaverage annual forfeiture rate of approximately nine percent to all unvested stockbased awards as of december 31 2013 which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period we reevaluate this analysis annually or more frequently if there are significant changes in circumstances and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary ultimately we will only recognize expense for those shares that
