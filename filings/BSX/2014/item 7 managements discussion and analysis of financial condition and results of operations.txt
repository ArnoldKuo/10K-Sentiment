this annual report for additional information on the neurovascular divestiture excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses our net sales increased 114 million or two percent as compared to the prior year this increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our endoscopy business of 89 million from our neuromodulation business of 87 million and from our peripheral interventions business of 43 million these increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in net sales from our interventional cardiology business of 124 million1 refer to the business and market overview section for further discussion of our sales resultsour reported net loss in 2013 was 121 million or 009 per share our reported results for 2013

treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures and intravascular ultrasound ivus imaging systems in the first quarter of 2013 we received ce mark approval and launched our promus premier everolimuseluting platinum chromium coronary stent system in europe and other select geographies in the fourth quarter of 2013 we received fda approval and launched promus premier in the us the promus premier stent system is designed to provide physicians improved drugeluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease featuring unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system we have also received ce mark approval for our next generation synergy everolimuseluting platinum chromium coronary stent system featuring an ultrathin abluminal outer bioabsorbable polymer coating and have commenced a limited commercial launch we expect to expand the launch in europe in the first half of 2014 the synergy stent is unique in that its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months this innovation has the potential to improve postimplant vessel healing and eliminate longterm polymer exposure a possible cause of late adverse events we have completed patient enrollment in the evolve ii clinical trial which is designed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the synergy stent system and support us food and drug administration and japanese regulatory approvals for this technologyour worldwide net sales of interventional cardiology products were 1997 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 or approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 our worldwide net sales of interventional cardiology products decreased 182 million or eight percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had a 58 million negative impact on our interventional cardiology net sales in 2013 as compared to 2012 net sales of these products decreased 124 million or six percent this decrease was primarily due to lower coronary stent system sales partially offset by higher sales of our nonstent interventional cardiology productsour coronary stent system sales represent a significant portion of

in 2013 as compared to 2012 our us net sales of drugeluting stent systems decreased 109 million or 20 percent in 2013 as compared to 2012 this decrease was primarily related to lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 continued average selling price declines in the us des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes our international drugeluting stent system net sales decreased 55 million or eight percent in 2013 as compared to the previous year due to continued lower market share related to competitive launches historically the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility we believe that we will continue to maintain a strong position within the worldwide coronary stent market for a variety of reasons includingthe performance benefits of our current and future technologythe strength of our pipeline of drugeluting stent products which has shown favorable results in clinical trials to datethe breadth and depth of our interventional cardiology product portfolio 39the broad and consistent longterm results of our clinical trialsour overall position in the interventional medical device market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales forcethe strength of our clinical selling marketing and manufacturing capabilities andour

compared to 2012 was principally the result of a decrease in net sales of our defibrillator systems due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental competitive and other pricing pressures partially offset by slight increases in unit volumes our pacemaker system net sales increased less than one percent during 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the continued strong performance of our ingenio family of pacemaker systemsduring the second quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of cameron health inc cameron developed the worlds first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator the sicd system which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing icd market and expand that market over time the sicd system has received ce mark and fda approval we became supply constrained in early march 2013 and were only able to provide a very limited supply of sicd systems during the second and third quarters of 2013 we continued to make progress in our efforts to enhance the sicd supply chain and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we were able to resume our launch of our sicd systemnet sales from our crm products represent a significant source of our overall net sales therefore increases or decreases in our crm net sales could have a

certain developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions healthcare sectors and our global capabilities which currently include 20 countries we are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our emerging markets and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities our emerging markets revenue was approximately eight percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013 restructuring initiativeson an ongoing basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success these initiatives are described below and

stryker corporation for a purchase price of 15 billion in cash we received 1450 billion during 2011 10 million during 2012 30 million during 2013 and received the final 10 million in january 2014 after the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement and also manufactured and supplied products to stryker through a supply agreement these transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013 we recorded neurovascular revenue of 58 million during 2013 122 million during 2012 and 141 million during 2011 our sales related to our divested neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated we do not expect revenue from our divested neurovascular business to be significant in 2014 divestiturerelated gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance see results of operations and note c  divestitures for additional informationhealthcare reformthe patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in 2010 certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood therefore it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices beginning in january 2013 in 2013 we recorded 73 million within our selling general and administrative expenses other provisions of this law including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs comparative effectiveness research an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchasesany changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations we cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally 44we expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations acos continue to take shape globally some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the us japan and europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients in japan the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those proceduresresults of operationsnet saleseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business

sales from divested businesses our net sales decreased 232 million or three percent as compared to the prior year this decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our interventional cardiology business of 266 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012 average selling price declines in the des market as a result of competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes and declines in our crm net sales of 145 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the icd market lower average selling prices and lower volumes these decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales during 2012 from our endoscopy business of 84 million from our peripheral interventions business of 56 million and net sales from our neuromodulation business of 32 million as compared to 2011gross profitour gross profit was 4969 billion in 2013 4900 billion in 2012 and 4963 billion in 2011 as a percentage of net sales our gross profit increased to 696 percent in 2013 as compared to 676 percent in 2012 and 651 percent in 2011 the following is a reconciliation of our

current year696 676 the increase in our gross profit margin for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross profit margin was also positively impacted by lower sales related to our divested businesses as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins in addition during the second quarter of 2013 we recorded a 16 million credit to cost of products sold related to the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems this credit is included in the all other caption in the table above partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing and sales mix related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products the main factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin during 2012 as compared to 2011 was the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drugeluting stent and crm products however these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internallydeveloped and selfmanufactured nextgeneration promus element stent system during 2012 our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories additionally affecting our 2012 to 2011 comparison of gross margin was the impact of a onetime 50 million credit to cost of products sold related to a twoyear retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product

higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by our increased investment related to acquisitions strategic growth initiatives and our expansion efforts in emerging markets as well as 73 million of expense associated with the new excise tax on us sales of class i ii and iii medical devices that went into effect january 1 2013 partially offsetting these increases were declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2012 our sgampa expenses increased 48 million or two percent as compared to 2011 and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion particularly in emerging markets and a nonrecurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against longoutstanding receivables in greece these increases in sgampa were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates research and development rampd expensesin 2013 our rampd expenses decreased 25 million or approximately three percent as compared to 2012 and were 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease was due primarily to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient partially offsetting the decrease was rampd funding for our acquisitions we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growthin 2012 our rampd expenses decreased 9 million or approximately one percent as compared to 2011 and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales the slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs partially offset by increased rampd funding for our acquisitions royalty expensein 2013 our royalty expense decreased 13 million or nine percent as compared to 2012 and was ten basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessin 2012 our royalty expense decreased 19 million or 11 percent as compared to 2011 and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royaltybearing products within our interventional cardiology businessamortization expenseour amortization expense was 410 million in 2013 as compared to 395 million in 2012 an increase of 15 million or four percent this increase was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of bridgepoint rhythmia and vessix which all took place in the fourth quarter of 2012 and electrophysiology business or cr bard inc which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013  47amortization expense was 395 million in 2012 as compared to 421 million in 2011 a decrease of 26 million or six percent this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquiditygoodwill impairment chargeseffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes we identified the following new global reporting units effective as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation refer to critical accounting estimates for further discussion of the reorganization and the resulting global reporting units the discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods relates to our former regional reporting units for our 2012 and prior impairment assessments we identified i six reporting units within the us which included our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises which in aggregate made up the us reportable segment and ii four international reporting units including emea consisting of europe middle east and africa japan asia pacific and the americas 2013 chargewe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units the fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of the global crm reporting unit the global crm reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global crm reporting unit was 4636 billion as of january 1 2013 in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 we tested the global crm amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global crm reporting unit we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis and concluded that these assets were not impairedthe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global crm reporting unit and recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 423 million 421 million aftertax to writedown the goodwill to its implied fair value as of january 1 2013 the primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of january 1 2013 which changed the composition of our reporting units as a result of the reorganization any goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses under our former reporting unit structure the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region the hypothetical tax structure of the global crm business and the global crm business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge we finalized the second step of the global crm goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required after recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013 there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global crm reporting unit the goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global crm basis pursuant to our new organizational structure we used the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method to derive the fair value of the global crm reporting unit we completed a dcf model associated with our new global crm business including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows tax attributes the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate marketparticipant riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital wacc of approximately 12 percent 48in the second quarter of 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units in conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except crm for which no goodwill remains therefore it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm further the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the 4374 billion of crmrelated amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods an impairment of a material portion of our crmrelated amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period refer to critical accounting policies and estimates of this item 7 for further discussion of our crmrelated intangible assets2012 chargesduring the second quarter of 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of 3602 billion 3579 billion aftertax as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and our performance in the european market we updated shortterm operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management we reduced the emea longterm growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15year dcf model for emea by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in europe in addition our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measuresin the third quarter of 2012 we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a noncash 748 million pre and aftertax charge associated with our former us crm reporting unit primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts the us crm market is dynamic highly competitive and difficult to forecast in the third quarter of 2012 we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth adjustments to our business and other competitive factors the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals efforts to reduce health care costs focus on appropriate device usage replacement volumes and competition and were more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated in addition we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return as a result of these factors we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points 2011 chargebased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011 we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former us crm business unit therefore we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 697 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011 refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 49intangible asset impairment charges2013 chargesduring the third quarter of 2013 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projectsand our indefinite lived core technology assets and recorded no impairments based on the results of our testing these indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies described in note a  significant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual reportduring the second quarter of 2013 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with certain of our acquisitions based on the results of our impairment analyses we revised our expectations of the market size related to sadra and the resulting timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows associated with the technology acquired from sadra as a result of these changes we recorded pretax impairment charges of 51 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2013 during the second quarter of 2013 we also recorded an additional 2 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the amount of the expected cash flows related to certain other acquired inprocess research and development projects2012 chargesduring the third quarter of 2012 we performed our annual impairment test of all inprocess research and development projects and our indefinite lived core technology assets based on the results of our annual test we recorded total impairment charges of 13 million to writedown the balances of certain inprocess projects to their fair value these charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an inprocess project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an inprocess projectduring the second quarter of 2012 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test we performed an interim impairment test of our inprocess research and development projects associated with our acquisition of sadra medical inc based on our impairment analysis we revised our expectations of the required effort time and cost involved in completing the inprocess projects and bringing the related products to market as a result of these changes we recorded an impairment charge of 129 million to writedown the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012 2011 chargesduring the third quarter of 2011 we recorded a 9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain inprocess research and development projects intangible asset impairment charges are noncash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquiditycontingent consideration expensecertain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones including attaining specified revenue levels achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals in accordance with us gaap we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestoneswe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of 4 million in 2013 a net benefit of 6 million in 2012 and a net expense of 7 million in 2011 contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating performance see note b  acquisitions to our 2013

tax ratethe change in our reported tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 and 2011 relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate in 2013 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges acquisition and divestiturerelated net charges litigation and restructuringrelated charges and debt extinguishment charges our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied in 2012 these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges acquisition and divestiturerelated net credits and litigation and restructuringrelated charges our reported tax rate for 2012 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2013 and 2012 the change in our reported tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business in 2011 these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the neurovascular business a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring litigation and acquisitionrelated charges and credits our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets changes in various state tax laws the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and the finalization of our 2010 us federal tax returnwe have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and boston scientific corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years subsequent to issuing these notices the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is 1162 billion plus interest the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant in addition the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidants vascular intervention business to abbott in april 2006 we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the irs or its resulting assessment and we believe that the irs has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated thirdparty agreement with abbott in addition we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulationswe believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed or will timely file petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved which based on experiences of other companies could take several years the irs is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of boston scientific during the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the irs of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in us tax court for our tax years prior to 2008 as with the prior years we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable irs and judicial procedures as appropriate we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations however final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 53liquidity and capital resourcesas of december 31 2013 we had 217 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand comprised of 38 million invested in money market and government funds and 179 million in interest bearing and noninterest bearing bank accounts we invest excess cash on hand in shortterm financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection

activities 5967441728operating activitiesduring 2013 we generated 1082 billion from operating activities as compared to 1260 billion in 2012 a decrease of 178 million this reduction was primarily due to the impact of increased levels of accounts receivable of approximately 100 million payments related to debt extinguishment of approximately 70 million and net payments associated with litigation of approximately 50 million partially offset by a final cash receipt associated with our promus supply agreement with abbottduring 2012 we generated 1260 billion from operating activities as compared to 1008 billion in 2011 an increase of 252 million this increase was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventory reductions which generated 103 million the impact of litigationrelated payments of approximately 300 million to the us department of justice in 2011 and lower taxrelated net cash outflows of approximately 40 million during 2012 partially offsetting these items was the impact of

region we estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the inprocess research and development projects acquired in 20112013 is between 200 million and 250 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2014 through 2018 following the respective launches of these technologies in the us europe and japan regions certain of our acquisitions also

technology driven as a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation over the years there has been litigation initiated against us by others including our competitors claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable in addition competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties in some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies during recent years we successfully negotiated closure of several longstanding legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters however there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial position results of operations andor liquidityin the normal course of business product liability securities and commercial claims are asserted against us similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims the absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future regardless of their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityin addition like other companies in the medical device industry we are subject to extensive regulation by national state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory marketing and other business practices these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor liquidityour accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was 607 million as of december 31 2013 and 491 million as of december 31 2012 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement damages and defense we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts if any that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and therefore additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future which could materially adversely impact our operating results cash flows andor our ability to comply with our debt covenantssee further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k  commitments and contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportcritical accounting estimatesour financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we describe these accounting policies in note asignificant accounting policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual reportto prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period the following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical 58revenue recognitionwe allow our customers to return defective damaged and in certain cases expired products for credit we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product in addition we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for nextgeneration product offerings for these transactions we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the nextgeneration products are shipped to the customer uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimatesmany of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system which represents a future service obligation for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations therefore we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available otherwise we use our best estimate of selling price we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferralinventory provisionswe base our provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess expired and obsolete inventory in the future further the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions uncertain timing of nextgeneration product approvals variability in product launch strategies product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess expired and obsolete inventoryvaluation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilitieswe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination including inprocess research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use further for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory revenue or commercializationbased milestones the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical regulatory or revenuebased milestones could result in different purchase price allocations amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periodswe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable as discussed in note a  significant accounting policies we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a riskadjusted discount rate in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group the use of alternative assumptions including estimated cash flows discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment in addition we test our indefinitelived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinitelived assets we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset we write the carrying value down to the fair value 59valuation of crmrelated amortizable intangible assetscertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our crm business 4374 billion globally as of december 31 2013 are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life for purposes of testing the crmrelated amortizable intangible assets we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global crm reporting unit as a result of having identified the crm reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our crm core technology which is the primary asset within the crm asset group is utilized by all crm revenuegenerating products as a result we include cash flows generated by our crm products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life which is estimated to end in 2031 we determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business our core technology represents knowhow patented and unpatented technology testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future crm product generations this core technology includes battery and capacitor technology lead technology software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise the recoverability of our crmrelated amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global crm business performance the amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue expenses and capital expenditures which are based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates these future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the crm reporting units product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology the increased impact to the crm reporting unit from emerging markets and demographic trends toward an aging population further while our crm revenue has declined over the last three years as a result of factors specific to our crm business and contraction in the overall crm market we believe our crm revenue will return to low growth over the remaining useful life of our crm amortizing intangible assets events specific to our crm business included the 2010 product ship hold actions and resulting market share losses and lower replacement volumes due to historical product recalls we believe that the contraction in the crm market was primarily due to lower procedural volumes principally due to a focus on appropriate device usage and increased pressure on selling prices however we believe that there has been a recent trend toward stabilization in procedural volumes across the marketwe continue to perform thorough reviews of the crm market and our recent business results within the market and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful lifegoodwill valuationeffective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes following the reorganization based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker we have three new global reportable segments consisting of cardiovascular rhythm management and medsurg we determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components through this process we identified the following new global reporting units as of january 1 2013 interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulationto determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units on a relative fair value basis we reallocated 1764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific japan and americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units in addition we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former us divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit the 2380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former us cardiovascular reporting unit was reallocated between the new global interventional cardiology and global peripheral interventions reporting units on a relative fair value basis  60we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist in performing the assessment we utilize the twostep approach prescribed under asc topic 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units as defined to the fair value of these units we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics for our 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units including interventional cardiology peripheral interventions cardiac rhythm management electrophysiology endoscopy urology and womens health and neuromodulation for our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments we identified six reporting units within the us including our crm neuromodulation endoscopy urology and womens health electrophysiology and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises in addition we identified four international reporting units including emea japan asia pacific and the americas when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition in addition for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests assets and liabilities including corporate assets which relate to a reporting units operations and would be considered in determining its fair value are allocated to the individual reporting units we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit but from which the reporting unit benefits based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unitduring 2013 2012 and 2011 we used only the income approach specifically the dcf method to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments this approach calculates fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these aftertax cash flows to a present value using a riskadjusted discount rate we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technologybased assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach therefore we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting unitsin applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets long range strategic plans and other estimates the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable perpetual growth of our reporting units we use estimates of marketparticipant riskadjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flowsif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists we then perform the second step of the goodwill test the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods once we have finalized the second step of the impairment testalthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results the use of alternative valuation assumptions including estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 61we have identified our global neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods our global neuromodulation reporting unit holds 1356 billion of allocated goodwill the level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global crm on a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability terminal value growth rate assumptions as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows these assumptions are subject to uncertainty including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges for example keeping all other variables constant an increase in the wacc applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global neuromodulation reporting unit the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates which we believe to be reasonable but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units andor amortizable intangible assets include but are not limited todecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in procedural volumes pricing pressures reductions in reimbursement levels product actions andor competitive or disruptive technology developmentsdeclines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition an inability to develop or launch new and nextgeneration products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies

informationuse of nongaap financial measures by boston scientificto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis we disclose certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates these nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united statesthe gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this nongaap financial measure and the nongaap financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis reconciliations of each of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules 63management uses these supplemental nongaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period to analyze the underlying trends in our business to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources in addition management uses these nongaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments the adjustments excluded from our nongaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of net sales and profit or loss these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performancewe believe that presenting adjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decisionmaking and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performancethe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these nongaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual itemsadjusted net income and adjusted net income per sharegoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  this amount represents a a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013 b noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second quarter of 2013 c a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former us cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012 d a noncash writedown of our goodwill balance attributable to our former emea reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012 and e noncash writedowns of certain intangible asset balances in the second and third quarters of 2012 we remove the impact of noncash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityacquisition and divestiture related net charges credits  these adjustments consist of a contingent consideration fair value adjustments b due diligence other fees and exit costs and c separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011 the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments due diligence other fees and exit costs include legal tax severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancerestructuring and restructuringrelated charges  these adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our 2014 restructuring program and 2011 restructuring program these costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancelitigationrelated charges  these adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigationrelated charges and credits these amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 64discrete tax items  these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges acquisition divestiture restructuring or litigationrelated charges or credits these adjustments do not reflect expected ongoing operating results accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performancedebt extinguishment charge  this item represents premiums accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of 1450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013 these adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results accordingly management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceamortization expense  amortization expense is a noncash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations we believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth therefore amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation accordingly management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these nongaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance particularly in terms of liquidityrevenue growth rates excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange ratessales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict accordingly management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses andor changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performanceadjusted net income adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts such as the sales from divested businesses andor the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable gaap financial measures further other companies may calculate these nongaap financial measures differently than we do which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposesrule 10b51 trading plans by executive officersperiodically certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with
