adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand in the event of a significant interruption for example as result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals as a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could

certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements in certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition particularly materials or components related to our crm products and drugeluting stent systems in addition our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and thirdparty vendors to perform this service to the extent we or our thirdparty sterilizers are unable to sterilize our
