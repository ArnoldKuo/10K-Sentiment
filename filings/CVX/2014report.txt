description of chevron chevron corporation a delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to us and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations chemicals operations mining operations and power and energy services upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for developing and producing crude oil and natural gas processing liquefaction transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines transporting storage and marketing of natural gas and a gastoliquids project downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products marketing of crude oil and refined products transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives  a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page e4 as of december 31 2013 chevron had approximately 64600 employees including about 3200 service station employees approximately 32000 employees including about 3000 service station employees or 50 percent were employed in us operations  overview of petroleum industry  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to  other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly   strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets  operating environment  refer to pages fs2 through fs8 of this form 10k in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

billion or about 78 percent of this amount for projects outside the united states   refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page fs12   upstream  the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2013 and 2012 by the company and its affiliates worldwide oilequivalent production of 2597 million barrels per day in 2013 was essentially unchanged from 2012 the benefits of lower maintenancerelated downtime and higher reliability at the tengizchevroil facilities in kazakhstan and rampups at the usan project in nigeria in the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania and in the delaware basin in new mexico were offset by normal field declines refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2011 through 2013 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas   the company estimates its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2014 will be approximately 2610 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 109 per barrel in 2013 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups and rampups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the longerterm outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production activities

wwwsecgovitem 1arisk factorschevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk chevron accepts27 the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales the scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the companys business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment the companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks  chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors  for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs39the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business the companys operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties  in certain locations governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest28acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations those developments have at times significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2013 21 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentyone percent of the companys net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2013 regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons products continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results  international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the companys activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products some of these activities such as consumers and customers use of the companys products as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the companys control  the effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for  products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes revenues and margins changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys

republic of the congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united states venezuela and vietnamearnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the price of crude oil in the downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly earnings during the year  to sustain its longterm competitive position in the upstream business the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required identifying promising areas for exploration acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas drilling successfully and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and costeffective manner are all important factors in this effort projects often require long lead times and large capital commitmentsthe companys operations especially upstream can also be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates including the united states from time to time certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company governments may attempt to do so in the future civil unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countriesthe company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2013 asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or lossesthe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planningcomments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the fs2companys production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulationsthe company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs however price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supplyanddemand conditions for such materials and services in recent years chevron and the oil and gas industrygenerally experienced an increase in certain costs thatexceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of theworld capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrestthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 109 per barrel for the fullyear 2013 compared to 112 in 2012 as of midfebruary 2014 the brent price was 109 per barrel the majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the wti price averaged 98 per barrel for the fullyear 2013 compared to 94 in 2012 as of midfebruary 2014 the wti price was 100 per barrel wti continued to trade at a discount to brent in 2013 due to historically high inventories stemming from strong growth in domestic production and limitations on outbound pipeline capacity from the us midcontinent after narrowing during the first six months of 2013 the wti discount slowly widened into  the fourth quarter as seasonal refinery turnarounds contributed to surplus supply conditions for wti while brent prices were supported by supply disruptions due to international eventsa differential in crude oil prices exists between highquality highgravity lowsulfur crudes and those of lower quality lowgravity highsulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel during 2013 the differential between north american light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms due to growth in us light sweet crude production in the midcontinent region and pipeline capacity constraints at cushing outside of north america the lightheavy crude differential narrowed modestly in 2013 as supply disruptions in key producing countries tightened light sweet crude markets and additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came online chevron produces or shares in the production of

page fs10 for the companys average us and international crude oil realizationsin contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supplyanddemand conditions in those markets in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 370 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2013 compared with 271 during 2012 as

united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north americaoutside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances in some locations chevron is investing in longterm projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets international natural gas realizations averaged about 591 per mcf during 2013 compared with 599 per mcf during 2012 see page fs10 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the us and international regionsthe companys worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2013 averaged 2597 million barrels per day about onefifth of the companys net oilequivalent production in 2013 occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2013 or 2012 at their december 2013 meeting members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day which has been in effect since december 2008 the company estimates that oilequivalent production in 2014 will average approximately 2610 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 109 per barrel for the fullyear 2013 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united states refer to the results

period ending december 31 2013on november 7 2011 while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor emitting approximately 2400 barrels of oil the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned on march 14 2012 the company identified a small second seep in a different part of the field no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts fs4related to these seeps have emerged a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking 107 billion in damages for each of the two seeps on october 1 2013 the court dismissed the two civil lawsuits and approved a settlement under which chevron and its consortium partners agreed to spend approximately 43 million on social and environmental programs on november 11 2013 the court announced that the settlement is final the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against chevron and eleven chevron employees on february 19 2013 the court dismissed the criminal matter and on appeal the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authorities the company is assessing its legal options the companys ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable but could be significant to net income in any one period downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational eventsother factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the companys shipping operations which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the companys

on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known fs15managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations  the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 1the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and2the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is materialthe development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed critical and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevrons estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology and economic conditions the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevrons consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following1amortization  proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unitofproduction uop method capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a uop basis using proved developed reserves acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves during 2013 chevrons uop depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa for oil and gas properties was 116 billion and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2013 were 48 billion barrels if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties uop ddampa in 2013 would have increased by approximately 600 million2impairment  oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would  trigger an impairment review in assessing whether the property is impaired the fair value of the property must be determined frequently a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value proved reserves and in some cases a portion of unproved resources are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments see impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates belowrefer to table v reserve quantity information beginning on page fs64 for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending december 31 2013 and to table vii changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs72 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2013 this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs27 which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activitiesimpairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppampe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on fs16assumptions that are consistent with the companys business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 9 beginning on page fs33 and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page fs27no material individual impairments of ppampe or investments were recorded for the three years ending december 31 2013 a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the companys ppampe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity analysis from time to time the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets associated carrying values asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2013 is not practicable given the broad range of the companys longlived assets and the  number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 24 on page fs56 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligationspension and other postretirement benefit plans  note 21 beginning on page fs48 includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptionsthe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the companys processes to develop these assumptions is included on page fs48 in note 21 under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial marketsfor 2013 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 75 percent and a discount rate of 36 percent for us pension plans for the 10 years ending december 31 2013 actual asset returns averaged 64 percent for the plan the actual return for 2013 was more than 75 percent and was associated with a continuing recovery in the financial markets during the year additionally with the exception of two other years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 75 percenttotal pension expense for 2013 was 13 billion an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the companys primary us pension plan which accounted for about 59 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2013 by approximately 85 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2013 by approximately 190 million the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2013 was a net liability of approximately 24 billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2013 the company used a discount rate of fs17managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations 43 percent to measure the obligations for the us pension plans as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary us pension plan which accounted for about 59 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 345 million which would have increased the plans overfunded status from approximately 04 billion to 07 billion for the companys opeb plans expense for 2013 was 218 million and the total liability which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2013 was 31 billion for the main us opeb plan the company used a 39 percent discount rate to measure expense in 2013 and a 47 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2013 discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2013 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of

contributions is included on page fs53 in note 21 under the heading cash contributions and benefit payments contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as operating expenses or selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 23 beginning on page fs54 refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2013 an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not  practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the

for industrial uses and additives for fuels and lubricant oils  the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method as part of that accounting the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income  investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated  recovery in the investments market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value  differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the companys commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet shortterm investments all shortterm investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as time deposits the balance of shortterm investments is reported as marketable securities and is markedtomarket with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income inventories crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market materials supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost fs27notes to the

accounting for suspended exploratory well costs  longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net beforetax cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair

individual field basis outside the united states reviews are performed on a country concession development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation depletion and amortization expense  longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 9 beginning on page fs32 relating to fair value measurements  the fair value of a liability for an aro

the manufacture of gasoline in the united states ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil  company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations  based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors fs39notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars except pershare amounts   note 14 litigation  continuedfailure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations  in 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 18900 which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineers report also asserted that an additional 8400 could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment in 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome the judge presiding over the case was recused in 2010 chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct in august 2010 the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement  in september 2010 chevron submitted its position on damages asserting that no amount should be assessed against it the plaintiffs submission which relied in part on the mining engineers report took the position that damages are between approximately 16000 and 76000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately 5000 and 38000 the next day the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved in october 2010 chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case on december 17 2010 the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment  on

to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately 8600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling or february 3 2012 chevron did not issue an apology

cassation the appellate panels decision to ecuadors national court of justice as part of the appeal chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement

rendered by the federal district court as of the date of this report the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september 2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss fs42notes to the consolidated financial statements

tax rate in international upstream operations the lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 equity income is included as

amounts that are in managements assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2013 the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately 3064 and tax credit carryforwards of

might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely at the end of 2013 deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods  the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured

approximately 71 percent of the 3848 of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition  tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the companys major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december

2007  the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits fs44notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of

in december 2016 that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the

expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the companys estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies  for 2013 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 75 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 71 percent of the companys pension plan assets in 2012 and 2011 the company used a longterm rate of return of 75 and 78 percent respectively for this plan  the marketrelated value of assets of the major us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the threemonth time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds at december 31 2013 the company used a 43 percent discount rate for the us pension plans and 47 percent for the main us opeb plan the discount rates at the end of 2012 and 2011 were 36 and 39 percent and 38 and 40 percent for the us pension plans and the main us opeb plans respectivelyother benefit assumptions for the

asset retirement obligation aro as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates  aros are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro the company performs periodic reviews of its

comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards      proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate      proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods     due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available     proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of corporate reserves a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities the manager of corporate reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a master of science in petroleum engineering degree from stanford university his experience includes fs64 table v reserve

society of petroleum evaluation engineers and serves on the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates the reserves activities are managed by two operating companylevel reserves managers these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve corporatelevel independence     the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the corporate reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves  during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual  technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions  in 2013 additions to chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates proved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2013 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 51 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe a decrease of 56 million boe from yearend 2012 the decrease was due to the transfer of 461 million boe to proved developed partially offset by increases of 210 boe in extensions and discoveries 7 million boe in purchases 42 million boe in improved recovery and 146 million boe in revisions investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2013 investments totaling approximately 174 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 34 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves australia accounted for 96 billion of the total mainly for development and construction activities at the gorgon and wheatstone lng projects expenditures of about 35 billion in the united states related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midcontinent region in asia expenditures during the year totaled 30 billion primarily related to development projects in thailand indonesia and with the tco affiliate in kazakhstan in africa about 29 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria and angola  proved undeveloped reserves for five years or more  reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels  fs65 table v reserve quantity information  continued at yearend 2013 the company held approximately 16 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the reserves are held by consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in africa the majority of the approximately 300 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more is related to deepwater and natural gas developments in nigeria major nigerian deepwater development projects include agbami which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity and the usan development which started production in 2012 also in nigeria various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects are currently under development in asia less than 200 million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years the majority relate to ongoing development activities in the pattani field in thailand and the azerichiraggunashli fields in azerbaijan  affiliates account for 11 billion barrels of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion in venezuela development drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates for 2013 this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 44 percent and 46 percent the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period        proved reserve quantities at december 31 2013 proved reserves for the company were 112 billion boe approximately 18 percent of the total reserves were located in the united states      aside from the tco affiliates tengiz field in kazakhstan no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the companys total oilequivalent proved reserves about 18 other individual properties in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the companys oilequivalent proved reserves which in the aggregate accounted for 44 percent of the companys total oilequivalent proved reserves these properties were geographically dispersed located in the united states canada south america africa asia and australia      in the united states total proved reserves at yearend 2013 were 20 billion boe california properties accounted for 30 percent of the us reserves with most classified as heavy oil because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods most of the companys heavy oil fields in california employ a continuous steamflooding process the gulf of mexico region contains 26 percent of the us reserves and production operations are mostly offshore other us areas represent the remaining 44 percent of us reserves for production of crude oil some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods including waterflooding and co2 injectionfor the three years ending december 31 2013 the pattern of netreserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends
