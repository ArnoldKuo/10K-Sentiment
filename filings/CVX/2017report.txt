industry petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directlystrong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other

obligations most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities as discussed below in the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver 140 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 the company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed us reserves and thirdparty purchases these commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms 6outside the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1913 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 from operations in australia colombia denmark indonesia and the philippines these sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed

protection the company designs operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through sitespecific risk and impact assessments chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response including postincident remediation to complement the companys capabilities chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives including the marine spill response corporation which operates in us territorial waters and oil spill response ltd which operates globally the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss

and their impact on chevron and on the companys 2016 environmental expenditures refer to page fs18 and note 25 on page fs61 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and yearend reserves 19item 1a risk factorschevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil pricesextended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the companys upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition dependsthe scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the companys business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environmentchevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial conditioncyberattacks targeting chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or assets access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information including intellectual property business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operationsthe companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas 20industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs45the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business the companys operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries in addition changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitabilityregulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons hydrocarbon and other products in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the ieas world energy outlook scenarios anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until 2040 and even ghgconstrained scenarios such as the ieas 450 case anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial conditioninternational agreements eg the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol and national eg carbon tax capandtrade or efficiency standards regional and state legislation eg california ab32 and sb32 low carbon fuel standards and regulatory measures eg the us environmental protection agencys methane performance standards that aim to limit or reduce ghg 21emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are adopting policies to meet their paris agreement goals in the united states the company has been complying with currently implemented programs such as the federal renewable fuel standard program and related volume standards and state regulations such as california ab32 including the capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations followon legislation to california ab32 known as california sb32 was signed into law in 2016 with effect in 2020 and is currently in the scoping plan phase separately other states and localities have also sought to directly regulate ghg emissions through mechanisms such as for example a carbon tax many of the foregoing are still in a proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative efforts to be repealed or significantly reformed thus even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligations the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulations will have on the companyghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbonbased products make the companys products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources and adversely affect the companys sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers and customers use of the companys products as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the companys control in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and potentially private litigation against the companyconsideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the companys longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the companys activities in it and market conditionsthe ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the companys financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processeschanges in managements estimates and assumptions

area for the three years ended december 31 2016 business environment and outlook chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia azerbaijan bangladesh brazil canada china colombia democratic republic of the congo denmark indonesia kazakhstan myanmar nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united states and venezuela earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since midyear 2014 reflecting persistently high global crude oil inventories and production the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted and depending upon its duration will continue to significantly impact the companys results of operations cash flows leverage capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook the company is responding with reductions in operating expenses including employee reductions pacing and refocusing of capital and exploratory expenditures  and increased asset sales the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance however the timing of any such increase is unknown in the companys downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products it is the companys objective to deliver competitive results and shareholder value in any business environment the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 19 provides the companys effective income tax rate for the last three yearsrefer to the cautionary statement relevant to forwardlooking information on page 2 and to risk factors in part i item 1a on pages 20 through 22 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and fs2managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsvalue growth refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2016 asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or lossesthe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planningcomments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as followsupstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulationsthe company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs however price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control including among other things the general level of inflation commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supplyanddemand conditions for such materials and services as a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities since mid2014 these costs have declined capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction or other factorsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 44 per barrel for the fullyear 2016 compared to 52 in 2015 as of midfebruary 2017 the brent price was 55 per barrel the majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark crude oil prices remained low through much of 2016 but increased modestly late in the year after opec announced production cuts on november 30 2016 opec agreed to cap production at 325 million barrels per day starting in january 2017the wti price averaged 43 per barrel for the fullyear 2016 compared to 49 in 2015 as of midfebruary 2017 the wti price was 53 per barrel wti traded at a discount to brent for much of 2016 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the us market fs3managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsa differential in crude oil prices exists between highquality highgravity lowsulfur crudes and those of lower quality lowgravity highsulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supplydemand balances for each crude type which are functions of the capacity of refineries that are able to process each as feedstock into highvalue light products motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel in secondhalf 2016 the differential held generally steady in north america as robust refinery demand supported heavy crude values while light sweet crude prices in the us were supported by slowing domestic production outside of north america differentials were steady to slightly wider amid wellsupplied light sweet crude markets in the atlantic basin while continued robust middle east exports and rising iranian production kept pressure on heavier more sour crudes differentials widened in december as light sweet crude values benefited more from the announced opec deal chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain fields in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page fs12 for the companys average us and international crude oil realizationsin contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supplyanddemand conditions in those markets fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 246 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2016 compared with 262 during 2015 as of midfebruary 2017 the henry hub spot price was 286 per mcf outside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations in some locations chevron continues to invest in longterm projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets the companys longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices international natural gas realizations averaged 402 per mcf during 2016 compared with 453 per mcf during 2015 see page fs12 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the us and international regionsthe companys worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2016 averaged 2594 million barrels per day about onesixth of the companys net oilequivalent production in 2016 occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria and venezuela opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2016 or 2015 the company estimates that net oilequivalent production in 2017 will grow 4 to 9 percent compared to 2016 assuming a brent crude oil price of 50 per barrel and before the effect of anticipated asset sales the impact of 2017 asset sales on fullyear production is expected to be in the range of 50000 to 100000 barrels of oilequivalent per day depending on the timing of the close of individual transactions this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including the duration of the low price environment that began in secondhalf 2014 quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united statesfs4managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsin the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production was shutin beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing

2017 production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait the financial effects from the loss of

downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of

chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational eventsother factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and

laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements eg the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol and national eg carbon tax capandtrade or

standards that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulation are integrated into the companys strategy planning and capital investment reviews where applicable they are also factored into the companys longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and

refer to risk factors in part i item 1a on pages 20 through 22 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide or other hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity or financial positionaccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2016 at approximately 21 billion for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 05 billion of environmental capital expenditures and 16 billion of costs associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sitesfor 2017 total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 04 billion these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sitescritical accounting estimates and assumptions management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known fs18managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 1the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and2the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is materialthe development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed critical and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevrons estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development and production costs the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevrons consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following1amortization  capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unitofproduction uop basis using proved developed reserves acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves during 2016 chevrons uop depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa for oil and gas properties was 133 billion and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2016 were 54 billion barrels for consolidated companies if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties uop ddampa in 2016 would have increased by approximately 700 million2impairment  oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review proved reserves and in some cases a portion of unproved resources are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments see impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates belowrefer to table v reserve quantity information beginning on page fs69 for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending december 31 2016 and to table vii changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs75 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2016 this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 beginning on page fs30 which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activitiesimpairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppampe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the companys business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 17 on page fs44 and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page fs30fs19managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the companys crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets associated carrying valuesinvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2015 primarily as a result of downward revisions in the companys longerterm crude oil price outlook the impairments for the years 2016 and 2015 were primarily in brazil and the united states no material individual impairments of ppampe or investments were recorded for the year 2014 a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the companys ppampe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2016 is not practicable given the broad range of the companys longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 26 on page fs62 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligationspension and other postretirement benefit plans note 24 beginning on page fs56 includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptionsthe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the companys processes to develop these assumptions is included on page fs58 in note 24 under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial marketsfor 2016 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 725 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 44 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 30 percent for us pension plans the actual return for 2016 was 95 percent for the 10 years ending december 31 2016 actual asset returns averaged 45 percent for the plan additionally with the exception of three years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 725 percent during each yearfs20managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationstotal pension expense for 2016 was 12 billion an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the companys primary us pension plan which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2016 by approximately 86 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2016 by approximately 297 million the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2016 was a net liability of approximately 47 billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2016 the company used a discount rate of 39 percent to measure the obligations for the us pension plans as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary us pension plan which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 390 million and would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately 20 billion to 16 billion for the companys opeb plans expense for 2016 was 221 million and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2016 was 25 billion for the main us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 49 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 36 percent to measure expense in 2016 and a 41 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2016 discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2016 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2016 for information on the sensitivity of the health care costtrend rate refer to page fs59 in note 24 under the heading other benefit assumptions differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page fs57 in note 24 for a description of the method used to amortize the 57 billion of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2016 and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2017 in addition information related to company contributions is included on page fs60 in note 24 under the heading cash contributions and benefit payments contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as operating expenses or selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 25 beginning on page fs61 refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2016 an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates

the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars except pershare amountsnote 1 summary of significant accounting policiesgeneral the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occursubsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method as part of that accounting the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values fair value measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the marketderivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the companys commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet shortterm investments all shortterm investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as time deposits the balance of shortterm investments is reported as marketable securities and is markedtomarket with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income inventories crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market materials supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost properties plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending fs30notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars except pershare amountsdetermination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 22 beginning on page fs54 for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation depletion and amortization expense longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 10 beginning on page fs37 relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 26 on page fs62 relating to aros depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties except mineral interests are expensed using the unitofproduction method generally by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unitofproduction method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives in general the decliningbalance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states the straightline method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from sales as other income expenditures for maintenance including those for planned major maintenance projects repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount effective in the quarter ended december 31 2016 the company has elected to move the annual review of the goodwill balance from the third to fourth quarter to better align with the preparation and review of the companys business plan which is used in the test the change does not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated for crude oil natural gas and mineralproducing properties a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations refer to note 26 on page fs62 for a discussion of the companys arosfor federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the fs31notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars except pershare amountsregulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own internal environmental policies future amounts are not discounted recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates for those operations all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income the cumulative translation effects for those few entities both consolidated and affiliated using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in currency translation

income stock options and other sharebased compensation the company issues stock options and other sharebased compensation to certain employees for equity awards such as stock options total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards such as stock appreciation rights total compensation cost is based on the settlement value the company recognizes

related to the use of mtbe including personalinjury claims may be filed in the future the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states ecuador background chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations lago agrio judgment in 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 18900 which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineers report also asserted that an additional 8400 could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment in 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome the judge presiding over the case was recused in 2010 chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct in august 2010 the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement in september 2010 chevron submitted its position on damages asserting that no amount should be assessed against it the plaintiffs submission which relied in part on the mining engineers report took the position that damages are between approximately 16000 and 76000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately 5000 and 38000 the next day the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved in october 2010 chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case on december 17 2010 the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase

on january 6 2012 and the court issued a ruling in response on january 13 2012 purporting to clarify and amplify its january 3 2012 ruling which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately 8600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling or february 3 2012 chevron did not issue an

on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september 2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of

company had 9000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis the credit facilities consist of a 364day facility which enables borrowing of up to 6900 or the company can convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year and a 2100 fiveyear facility expiring in december 2020 these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank

and investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives the company also sponsors other postretirement benefit opeb plans that provide medical and dental benefits as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees the plans are unfunded and the company and retirees share the costs beginning in 2017 medical coverage for medicareeligible retirees in the companys main us medical plan is provided through a thirdparty private exchange the increase to the premedicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more

return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the companys estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies for 2016 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 725 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 69 percent of the companys pension plan assets in both 2015 and 2014 the company used a longterm rate of return of 75 percent for this plan the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the threemonth time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds beginning with the december 31 2015 measurement date the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2016 were 39 percent for the main us pension plan and 41 percent for the main us opeb plan the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2015 were 40 and 45 percent respectively while in 2014 they were 37 and 41 percent for these plans respectivelybeginning with the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost associated with the companys main us pension and opeb plans under the new method these costs are estimated by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in prior years the service and interest costs were estimated utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the yearother benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2016 for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 69 percent in 2017 and gradually decline to 45 percent for 2025 and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2015 the assumed health care costtrend rates started with fs58notes to

costs up to a maximum obligation of 200 which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the 200 obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 although the company has provided

oil fields and mining sitesalthough the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated

an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates fs62notes to the

company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standardsproved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimateproved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methodsdue to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes availableproved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the manager of global reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of fs69supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unauditedthe american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineersall rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the global reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reservesduring the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the boardrac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the global reserves manual in addition thirdparty engineering consultants are used to supplement the companys own reserves estimation controls and procedures including through the use of thirdparty audits of selected oil and gas assetstechnologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2016 additions to chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimatesproved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2016 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 36 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe a decrease of 656 million boe from yearend 2015 the decrease was due to the transfer of 11 billion boe to proved developed 7 million boe in revisions and 7 million boe in sales partially offset by increases of 277 million boe in improved recovery 189 million boe in extensions and discoveries and 10 million boe in acquisitionsduring 2016 investments totaling approximately 88 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 19 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves australia accounted for about 23 billion of the total mainly for development and construction activities at the wheatstone lng project expenditures of about 23 billion in the united states related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midcontinent region in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 29 billion primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan and in thailand in africa about 16 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada were primarily responsible for about 13 billion of expenditures in other americas reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels at yearend 2016 the company held approximately 22 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 600 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects the company is currently constructing liquefaction and other facilities in australia to develop this natural gas in africa approximately 400 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria affiliates account for about 14 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 10 billion boe that have fs70supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unauditedremained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2016 further reductions in commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve decreases and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections for 2016 this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 45 percent the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time periodproved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2016 the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the companys ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the companys control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrestat december 31
