development of business summary description of chevron chevron corporation a delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to us and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations chemicals operations mining activities power generation and energy services upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for developing and producing crude oil and natural gas processing liquefaction transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines transporting storage and marketing of natural gas and a gastoliquids project downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products marketing of crude oil and refined products transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives  a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages e4 and e5 as of december 31 2012 chevron had approximately 62000 employees including about 3700 service station employees approximately 31000 employees including about 3400 service station employees or 50 percent were employed in us operations  overview of petroleum industry  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to  other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly   strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets  operating environment  refer to pages fs2 through fs8 of this form 10k in managements discussion and

for about 72 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012 about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010 these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy inc in 2011   in 2013 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 367 billion including 33 billion of spending by affiliates approximately 90 percent of the total or 33 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities with 255 billion or about 70 percent of this amount for projects outside the united states   refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page fs12   upstream  the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2012 and 2011 by the company and its affiliates worldwide oilequivalent production was 2610 million barrels per day down about 2 percent from 2011 the decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines the shutin of the frade field in brazil and a major planned turnaround at the tengizchevroil facilities in kazakhstan the startup and rampup of several major capital projects  the platong ii natural gas project in thailand the usan and agbami 2 projects in nigeria and the perdido tahiti 2 and caesartonga projects in the us gulf of mexico  partially offset the decrease in net production from 2011 refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2010 through 2012 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas   the company estimates its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2013 will be approximately 2650 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 112 per barrel in 2012 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups and rampups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the longerterm outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production

available on the secs web site at wwwsecgovitem 1arisk factorschevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales  the scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the companys business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment the companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents nonetheless in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government 28action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors  for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on fs40the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business the companys operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties  in certain locations governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations those developments have at times significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2012 21 percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia  and kuwait twentyone percent of the companys net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2012 regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons products continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results  international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the companys activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products some of these activities such as consumers and customers use of the companys products as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the companys control  the effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes revenues and margins changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys

penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and utahs air quality laws these alleged violations were the subject of an august 20 2008 epa notice of violation nov for which no penalty was

business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia azerbaijan bangladesh brazil cambodia canada chad china colombia democratic republic of the congo denmark indonesia kazakhstan myanmar the netherlands nigeria norway the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of the congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united states venezuela and vietnam earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the level of the price of crude oil in the downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly  earnings during the year  to sustain its longterm competitive position in the upstream business the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required identifying promising areas for exploration acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas drilling successfully and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and costeffective manner are all important factors in this effort projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments the companys operations especially upstream can also be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates including the united states from time to time certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company governments may attempt to do so in the future civil unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2012 asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows      upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could fs2also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations  the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs however price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supplyanddemand conditions for such materials and services capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 112 per barrel for the fullyear 2012 compared to 111 in 2011 as of midfebruary 2013 the brent price was about 118 per barrel the majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the wti price averaged 94 per barrel for the fullyear 2012 compared to 95 in 2011 as of midfebruary 2013 the wti price was about 97 per barrel wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2012 due to high inventories in the us midcontinent market driven by strong growth in domestic production  a differential in crude oil prices exists between highquality highgravity lowsulfur crudes and those of lower quality lowgravity highsulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are  able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel during 2012 the differential between us light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms as light sweet crude oil production in the midcontinent region increased and outbound capacity at cushing remained constrained outside of the us the differential narrowed modestly during 2012 as additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came on line  chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california chad indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain fields in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page fs10 for the companys average us and international crude oil realizations in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supplyanddemand conditions in those markets in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 271 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2012 compared with about 400 during 2011 as of midfebruary 2013 the henry hub spot price was about 330 per mcf fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america outside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances in some locations chevron is investing in longterm projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets international natural gas realizations averaged about 600 per mcf during 2012 compared with about 540 per mcf during 2011 see page fs10 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions fs3managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations    the companys worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2012 averaged 2610 million barrels per day about onefifth of the companys net oilequivalent production in 2012 occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2012 or 2011 at their december 2012 meeting members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day which has been in effect since december 2008  the company estimates that oilequivalent production in 2013 will average approximately 2650 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 112 per barrel for the fullyear 2012 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups or rampups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united states refer to the results of operations section on pages fs6

the beginning of 2010 and each yearend from 2010 through 2012 and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the threeyear period ending december 31 2012 on november 7 2011 while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor emitting approximately 2400 barrels of oil the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged on march 14 2012 the company identified a small second seep in a different part of the field as a precautionary measure the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazils national petroleum agency anp to do so chevron and its partners are cooperating with the brazilian authorities on july 19 2012 anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking 107 billion in damages for  each of the two seeps the company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit on july 31 2012 a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency on september 28 2012 the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp on appeal on november 27 2012 the injunction was revoked in its entirety the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against 11 chevron employees jurisdiction for all three matters was moved from campos to a court in rio de janeiro on february 19 2013 the court dismissed the criminal matter which is subject to appeal by the prosecutor chevron has submitted to anp a plan for restarting limited fs4production in the frade field the companys ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable but could be significant to net income in any one period     the company entered into a nonbinding financing term sheet with petroboscan a joint stock company owned 392 percent by chevron which operates the boscan field in venezuela when finalized the financing is expected to occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and is intended to support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreedupon level the terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development as well as distributions to shareholders  including current outstanding obligations the loan will be repaid from future petroboscan crude sales definitive documents are under negotiation downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the companys shipping operations which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refining marketing and petrochemical assets the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america the us gulf coast asia and southern africa chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas the company completed a multiyear plan in 2012 to streamline the downstream asset portfolio to concentrate

upstream earnings of 53 billion in 2012 decreased 12 billion from 2011 primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil realizations of 340 million and 200 million respectively lower crude oil production of 240 million and lower gains on asset sales of 180 million  us upstream earnings of 65 billion in 2011 increased 24 billion from 2010 the benefit of higher crude oil realizations increased earnings by 28 billion between periods partly offsetting this effect were lower net oilequivalent production which decreased earnings by about 400 million and higher operating expenses of 200 million  the companys average realization for us crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2012 was 9521 per barrel compared with 9751 in 2011 and 7159 in 2010 the average natural gas realization was

percent from 2010 between 2012 and 2011 the decrease in production was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with cook inlet alaska assets sold in 2011 partially offsetting this decrease was a rampup of projects in the gulf of mexico and marcellus shale and improved operational performance in the gulf of mexico the net liquids component of oilequivalent production for 2012 averaged 455000 barrels per day down 2 percent from 2011 and 7 percent from 2010 net natural gas production averaged about 12 billion cubic feet per day in 2012 down approximately

reclassified to longterm at the end of each period respectively at yearend 2012 settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2013 as the company had the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis  at december 31 2012 the company had 60 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks expiring in december 2016 which enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2012 in addition in november 2012 the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a new registration statement that expires in november 2015 this registration statement is for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by  the

corporation and are rated aa by standard amp poors corporation and aa1 by moodys investors service the companys us commercial paper is rated a1 by standard amp poors and pl by moodys all of these ratings denote highquality investmentgrade securities  the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions based on its highquality debt ratings the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements the company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the companys highquality debt ratings   common stock repurchase program in july 2010 the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or

to the results of operations in any single period the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the companys liquidity or financial position accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business in addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products the company may incur expenses for

abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites for 2013 total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 12 billion these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sitescritical accounting estimates and assumptions management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 1the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and2the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is material     the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed critical and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows   pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations for other postretirement benefit opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded critical assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates   note 20 beginning on page fs49 includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and opeb plans at the end of 2012 and 2011 the components of pension and opeb expense for the three years ended december 31 2012 and the underlying assumptions for those periods  pension and opeb expense is reported on the consolidated statement of income as operating expenses or selling general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments the yearend 2012 and 2011 funded status measured as the difference between plan assets and obligations of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet the differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a longterm asset in deferred charges and other assets the differences associated with underfunded or unfunded pension and opeb plans are reported as accrued liabilities or reserves for employee benefit plans amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss  to estimate the longterm rate of return on pension assets the company uses a process that incorporates actual historical assetclass returns and an assessment of expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and assetclass factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the determination of the companys estimates of longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies for 2012 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 75 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 70 percent of the companys pension plan assets in 2011 and 2010 the company used a longterm rate of return of 78 percent for this plan for the 10 years ending december 31 2012 actual asset returns averaged 71 percent for this plan the actual return for 2012 was more than 75 percent and was associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year additionally with the exception of two other years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 75 percent fs16 the yearend marketrelated value of assets of the major us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months management considers the threemonth period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense  the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds at december 31 2012 the company used a 36 percent discount rate for the us pension plans and 39 percent for the main us opeb plan the discount rates at the end of 2011 and 2010 were 38 and 40 percent and 48 and 50 percent for the us pension plans and the main us opeb plans respectively  an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa total pension expense for 2012 was 13 billion as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary us pension plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately 80 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately 165 million  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan reported on the consolidated balance sheet the aggregate funded status recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012 was a net liability of approximately 59 billion as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary us pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 335 million which would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately 26 billion to 22 billion other plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase the actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial markets  in 2012 the companys pension plan contributions were 12 billion including 844 million to the us plans in 2013 the company estimates contributions will be approximately 10 billion actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results changes in pension obligations regulatory requirements and other economic factors additional funding may be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations  for the companys opeb plans expense for 2012 was 172 million and the total liability which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2012 was 38  billion      as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination  of opeb expense in 2012 a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary us opeb plan which accounted for about 82 percent of the companywide opeb expense would have decreased opeb expense by approximately 17 million a 025 percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan which accounted for about 83 percent of the companywide opeb liabilities would have decreased total opeb liabilities at the end of 2012 by approximately 80 million  for the main us postretirement medical plan the annual increase to company contributions is limited to 4 percent per year for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims experiences are combined for rating purposes the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 75 percent in 2013 and gradually drop to 45 percent for 2025 and beyond as an indication of the health care costtrend rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2012 a 1 percent increase in the rates for the main us opeb plan would have increased opeb expense by 15 million  differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual

as of december 31 2012 a description of the method used to amortize those costs and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2013  oil and gas reserves  crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevrons estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology and economic conditions fs17managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations      the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevrons consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following1amortization  proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unitofproduction uop method capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a uop basis using proved developed reserves acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves during 2012 chevrons uop depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa for oil and gas properties was 107 billion and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2012 were 48 billion barrels if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties uop ddampa in 2012 would have increased by approximately 540 million 2impairment  oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review in assessing whether the property is impaired the fair value of the property must be determined frequently a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value proved reserves and in some cases a portion of unproved resources are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments see impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates below     refer to table v reserve quantity information beginning on page fs67 for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending december 31 2012 and to table vii changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs75 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2012      this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs28 which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities  impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppampe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such indicators include changes in the companys business plans changes in commodity prices and for crude oil and natural gas properties significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve quantities if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash  flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value  determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the companys business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 8 beginning on page fs33 and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page fs28  no material individual impairments of ppampe or investments were recorded for the three years ending december 31 2012 a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the companys ppampe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired  investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time fs18 in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity analysis  from time to time the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets associated carrying values   asset retirement obligations  in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2012 is not practicable given the broad range of the companys longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 23 on page fs58 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations   contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology  under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as operating expenses or selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 14 beginning on page fs43 refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2012  an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method as part of that accounting the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income  investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to  allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value  differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the companys commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet shortterm investments all shortterm investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original

measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities among the required disclosures is the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value an asset or a liability the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities for the company level 1 inputs include exchangetraded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchangequoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded level 2 inputs other than level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the company level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities prices obtained through thirdparty broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract fs33notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars except pershare amounts note 8 fair

claim to be represenfs40 note 13 litigation  continuedtatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations  based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations  in 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 18900 which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineers report also asserted that an additional 8400 could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment in 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome the judge presiding over the case was recused in 2010 chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct in august 2010 the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days  chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement  in september 2010 chevron submitted its position on damages asserting that no amount should be assessed against it the plaintiffs submission which relied in part on the mining engineers report took the position that damages are between approximately 16000 and 76000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately 5000 and 38000 the next day the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved in october 2010 chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case on december 17 2010 the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment  on february 14 2011 the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case the court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion the judgment assessed approximately 8600 in damages and approximately 900 as an award for the plaintiffs representatives it also assessed an additional amount of approximately 8600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment which chevron did not do on february 17 2011 the plaintiffs appealed the judgment seeking increased damages and on march 11 2011 chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified on january 3 2012 an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the february 14 2011 decision and ordered that chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of 010 of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment the plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify fs41notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars except pershare amounts note 13 litigation  continuedand amplify the appellate decision on january 6 2012 and the court issued a ruling in response on january 13 2012 purporting to clarify and amplify its january 3 2012 ruling which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately 8600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling or february 3 2012 chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial on january 20 2012 chevron appealed called a petition for cassation the appellate panels decision to ecuadors national court of justice as part of the appeal chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal on february 17 2012 the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted chevrons cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the national court of justice to hear the appeal the provincial court appellate panel denied chevrons request for a suspension of the requirement that chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the first and second interim awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below on march 29 2012 the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the national court of justice and on november 22 2012 the national court agreed to hear chevrons cassation appeal on august 3 2012 the provincial court in lago agrio approved a courtappointed liquidators report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be 19100     chevron has no assets in ecuador and the lago agrio plaintiffs lawyers have stated in press releases and

nortberto priu requiring shares of both companies to be embargoed requiring third parties to withhold 40 of any payments due to chevron argentina srl and ordering banks to withhold 40 of the funds in chevron argentina srl bank accounts on december 14th 2012 the argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the freeze order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments the court also clarified that the freeze order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes on january 30 2013 an appellate court upheld the freeze order chevron continues to believe the provincial courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador the united states and other countries the company also believes the  judgment is the product of fraud and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in ecuador or any enforcement action chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september 2009 against the republic of ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law the claim alleges violations of the republic of ecuadors obligations under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty bit and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet described above which are investment agreements protected by the bit through the arbitration chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of ecuador including a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit on february 9 2011 the tribunal issued an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal on january 25 2012 the tribunal converted the order for interim measures into an interim award chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on january 4 2012 and the republic of ecuador opposed chevrons application and requested that the existing order for interim measures be vacated on january 9 2012 on february 16 2012 the tribunal issued a second interim award mandating that the republic of ecuador take all measures necessary whether by its judicial legislative or executive branches to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without ecuador of the judgment against chevron and in particular to preclude any certification by the republic of ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against chevron on february 27 2012 the tribunal issued a third interim award confirming its fs42 note 13 litigation  continuedjurisdiction to hear chevrons arbitration claims on april 9 2012 the tribunal issued a scheduling order to hear issues relating to the scope of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet and on july 9 2012 the tribunal indicated that it wanted to hear the remaining issues in january 2014 on february 7 2013 the tribunal issued its fourth interim award in which it declared that the republic of ecuador has violated the first and second interim awards under the bit the uncitral rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the lago agrio judgment within and outside ecuador including but not limited to canada brazil and argentina a schedule for the tribunals order to show cause hearing will be issued separately through a series of us court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud collusion corruption and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs in february 2011 chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers consultants and supporters alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws through the civil lawsuit chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable on march 7 2011 the federal district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending resolution of chevrons civil lawsuit by the federal district court on may 31 2011 the federal district court severed claims one through eight of chevrons complaint from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief on september 19 2011 the us court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the preliminary injunction stayed the trial on chevrons ninth claim a claim for declaratory relief that had been set for november 14 2011 and denied the defendants mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit the second circuit issued its opinion on january 26 2012 ordering the dismissal of chevrons ninth claim for declaratory relief on february 16 2012 the federal district court lifted the stay on claims one through eight and on october 18 2012 the federal district court set a trial date of october 15 2013  the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september 2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of

432 percent in 2012 the impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations was essentially offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods for international upstream the lower effective tax rates in the current period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales onetime tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes which were partially offset by a

standards for uncertainty in income taxes asc 74010 a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods  the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and

fourth quarter 2012 regarding the sustainability of certain us foreign tax credits the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits related to these foreign tax credits had no impact on the effective tax rate since the deferred tax asset recognized for these foreign tax credits has been offset with a full valuation allowance     approximately 67 percent of the 3071 of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition  tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the companys major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2012 for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states  2007 nigeria  2000 angola  2001 saudi arabia  2003 and kazakhstan  2006  the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits      the company is currently assessing the potential impact of an august 2012 decision by the us court of appeals for the third circuit that disallows the historic rehabilitation tax credits hrtcs claimed by an unrelated taxpayer the company has claimed a significant amount of hrtcs on its us federal income tax returns in open years and it is reasonably possible that the specific findings from managements ongoing assessment and evaluation could result in a significant increase in the companys unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months any such increase would impact the effective tax rate  on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax

shortterm obligations on a longterm basis these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2012  at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company classified 5900 and 5600 respectively of shortterm debt as longterm settlement of these obligations is

external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the companys estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies  for 2012 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 75 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 70 percent of the companys pension plan assets in 2011 and 2010 the company used a longterm rate of return of 78 percent for this plan  the marketrelated value of assets of the major us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the threemonth time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds at december 31 2012 the company used a 36 percent discount rate for the us pension plans and 39 percent for the main us opeb plan the discount rates at the end of 2011 and 2010 were 38 and 40 percent and 48 and 50 percent for the us pension plans and the main us opeb plans respectively other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit

for this measurement at december 31 2011 the assumed health care costtrend rates started with 8 percent in 2012 and gradually declined to 5 percent for 2023 and beyond in both measurements the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent  assumed health care costtrend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs the impact is

assessment soil excavation offsite disposal of contaminants onsite containment remediation andor extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil groundwater extraction and treatment and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants  the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local regulations no single remediation site at yearend 2012 had a recorded liability that was mate rial to the companys results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity  it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation relating to past operations these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties  refer to note 23 on page fs58 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations other contingencies on april 26 2010 a california appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an environmental impact report eir

the hydrogen plant certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure on june 10 2011 the city published its notice of preparation of the revised eir for the project the revised and recirculated eir is intended to comply with the appeals court decision management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain due to the uncertainty of the companys future course

asset retirement obligation aro as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates  aros are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream longlived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation  the following table indicates the changes to the companys beforetax

presentationtable v reserve quantity information reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards  proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams  composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of theinternal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of corporate reserves a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities the manager of corporate reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a master of science in petroleum engineering degree from stanford university his experience includes more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes he was chairman of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee served on the united nations expert group on resources classification and is a past member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training and the california conservation committee he is an active member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers and serves on the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 15 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates the reserves activities are managed by two operating companylevel reserves managers

price     the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the corporate reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves  during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board  rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions  in 2012 additions to chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates fs68 table v reserve quantity information  continued proved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2012 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 52 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe approximately 56 percent of these reserves are attributed to natural gas of which about 55 percent were located in australia crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids ngls accounted for about 38 percent of the total proved undeveloped reserves of which about 38 percent were from tco and the remaining large concentrations were in africa asia and the united states synthetic oil accounted for the balance of the proved undeveloped reserves  in 2012 a total of 394 million boe was transferred from proved undeveloped to proved developed in asia 98 million boe were transferred to proved developed primarily driven by development drilling performance in the united states approximately 95 million boe were transferred primarily due to ongoing drilling activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico and california affiliates accounted for 104 million boe transferred to proved developed due to ongoing development activities development drilling and the start up of several projects in africa europe and other americas accounted for the remainder investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2012 investments totaling approximately 107 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 35 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves australia accounted for 77 billion of the total mainly for development and construction activities at the gorgon and wheatstone lng projects in africa another 23 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria and angola expenditures of about 18 billion in the united states related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midcontinent region in asia expenditures during the year totaled 17 billion primarily related to development projects in thailand and indonesia  proved undeveloped reserves for five years or more reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels  at yearend 2012 the company held approximately 17 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the reserves are held by consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects  in africa the majority of the 300 million boe is related to deepwater and natural gas developments in nigeria major nigerian deepwater development projects include agbami which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity and the usan development which started production in 2012 also in nigeria various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects are currently under development in asia approximately 200 million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped after five years the majority relate to ongoing development activities in the pattani field thailand and the malampaya field philippines that are scheduled to maintain production within contractual and infrastructure constraints  in australia approximately 100 million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped due to a compression project at the north west shelf venture which is scheduled for startup in 2013 affiliated companies have approximately 10 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have been recorded for five years or more the tco affiliate in kazakhstan accounts for most of this amount production is constrained by plant capacity limitations in venezuela development drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates for 2012 this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 37 percent and 46 percent the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period  proved reserve quantities at december 31 2012 proved reserves for the company were 113 billion boe refer to the term reserves on page e11 for the definition of oilequivalent reserves approximately 17 percent of the total reserves were located in the united states      aside from the tco affiliates tengiz field in kazakhstan no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the companys total oilequivalent proved reserves about 20 other individual properties in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the companys oilequivalent proved reserves which in the aggregate accounted for 45 percent of the companys total oilequivalent proved reserves these properties were geographically dispersed located in the united states canada south america africa asia and australiafs69 table v reserve quantity information  continued     in the united states total proved reserves at yearend 2012 were 20 billion boe california properties accounted for 32 percent of the us reserves with most classified as heavy oil because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods most of the companys heavyoil fields in california employ a continuous steamflooding process the gulf of mexico region contains 26 percent of the us reserves and production operations are mostly offshore other us areas represent the remaining 42 percent of us reserves for production of crude oil some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods including waterflood and co2 injection  for the three years ending december 31 2012 the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not  necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by among other things events and circumstances that are outside the companys control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical
