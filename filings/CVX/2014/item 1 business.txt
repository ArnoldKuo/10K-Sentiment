had approximately 64600 employees including about 3200 service station employees approximately 32000 employees including about 3000 service station employees or 50 percent were employed in us operations  overview of petroleum industry  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to  other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly   strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets  operating environment  refer to pages fs2 through fs8 of this form 10k in managements discussion and

2013 90 percent or 379 billion was related to upstream activities approximately 89 percent was expended for upstream operations in both 2012 and 2011 international upstream accounted for about 78 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2013 about 72 percent in 2012 and about 68 percent in 2011 these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy inc in 2011   in 2014 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 398 billion including 48 billion of spending by affiliates approximately 90 percent of the total or 358 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities with 279 billion or about 78 percent of this amount for projects outside the united states   refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page fs12   upstream  the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2013 and 2012 by the company and its affiliates worldwide oilequivalent production of 2597 million barrels per day in 2013 was essentially unchanged from 2012 the benefits of lower maintenancerelated downtime and higher reliability at the tengizchevroil facilities in kazakhstan and rampups at the usan project in nigeria in the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania and in the delaware basin in new mexico were offset by normal field declines refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2011 through 2013 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas   the company estimates its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2014 will be approximately 2610 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 109 per barrel in 2013 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups and rampups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the longerterm outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas beginning on page 9 for a discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas development projectsas used in this report the term project may describe new
