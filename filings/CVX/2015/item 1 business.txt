products marketing of crude oil and refined products transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page e4 as of december 31 2014 chevron had approximately 64700 employees including about 3300 service station employees approximately 31800 employees including about 3100 service station employees or 49 percent were employed in us operations overview of petroleum industry petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directlystrong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets
