employees approximately 26500 employees including about 3100 service station employees or 48 percent were employed in us operations overview of petroleum industry petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directlystrong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and

the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities as discussed below in the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver 140 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 the company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed us reserves and thirdparty purchases these commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms 6outside the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1913 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 from operations in australia colombia denmark indonesia and the philippines these sales contracts
