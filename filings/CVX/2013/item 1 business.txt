marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives  a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages e4 and e5 as of december 31 2012 chevron had approximately 62000 employees including about 3700 service station employees approximately 31000 employees including about 3400 service station employees or 50 percent were employed in us operations  overview of petroleum industry  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to  other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly   strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets  operating environment  refer to pages fs2 through fs8 of this form 10k in managements discussion and

2012 89 percent or 304 billion was related to upstream activities approximately 89 and 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010 respectively international upstream accounted for about 72 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012 about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010 these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy inc in 2011   in 2013 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 367 billion including 33 billion of spending by affiliates approximately 90 percent of the total or 33 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities with 255 billion or about 70 percent of this amount for projects outside the united states   refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page fs12   upstream  the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2012 and 2011 by the company and its affiliates worldwide oilequivalent production was 2610 million barrels per day down about 2 percent from 2011 the decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines the shutin of the frade field in brazil and a major planned turnaround at the tengizchevroil facilities in kazakhstan the startup and rampup of several major capital projects  the platong ii natural gas project in thailand the usan and agbami 2 projects in nigeria and the perdido tahiti 2 and caesartonga projects in the us gulf of mexico  partially offset the decrease in net production from 2011 refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2010 through 2012 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas   the company estimates its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2013 will be approximately 2650 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of 112 per barrel in 2012 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups and rampups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the longerterm outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production
