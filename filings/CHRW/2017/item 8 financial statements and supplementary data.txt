effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 107000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also provide sourcing services our sourcing business consists of buying selling and marketing fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies transportation revenues generated by robinson fresh are included in our transportation service line in the first two tables below but are included in robinson fresh in the segment revenue table below our reportable segments are north american surface transportation nast global forwarding robinson fresh and all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses we group offices primarily by services they provide for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements our business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply in 2016 changing market conditions impacted our results we had volume increases in nearly all of our service lines but also experienced pricing declines which impacted our net revenue margins truckload margin compression was a challenge to our earnings per share during the second half of the year in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics apc a privately held company based in australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to the our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities freightquote operates in our nast segment the acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 65 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015 primarily in our ltl service linewe keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is tied to productivity and performance each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business24table of contentsour office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 966 employees during 2016 which includes approximately 300 employees added as a result of the apc acquisition compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentive is directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders our customers in 2016 we worked with more than 113000 active customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2016 our top 100 customers represented

in 2014 the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015 freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015 in addition we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 percent to 3588 million in 2015 from 3202 million in 2014 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses

the decrease of 1889 million in cash flow from operations in 2016 from 2015 is primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of increased volumes additionally accruals for variable compensation were lower in 2016 compared to 2015cash used for

2015 and 2014 we spent 250 million 260 million and 240 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the

we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature in december of 2014 we amended this facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019 and revised a covenant ratio this facility had 7400 million outstanding as of december 31

future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for the foreseeable future we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if neededcritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions33table of contentsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 395 million as of december 31 2016 decreased compared to the allowance of 435 million as of december 31 2015 this decrease was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumedprior to the quarter ended december 31 2016 we managed and reported our operations as one operating segment and also concluded we had one reporting unit consisting of our network of offices and we evaluated goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis on december 31 we continually evaluate our reporting units and during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we concluded that we had seven reporting units as a result of this change in reporting units we allocated goodwill to our reporting units based on each reporting units fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach additionally at this time we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from december 31 to november 30 of each year the change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our longterm planning process which is a significant input to the testing we performed a goodwill impairment assessment both prior to and after the change in reporting units at november 30 this change in testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocationthe fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuationsbased on our step one goodwill impairment analysis no impairments of goodwill were deemed to have occurred and the fair value of all of reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying value no events occurred from november 30 2016 to december 31 2016 to indicate any changes to our impairment conclusions at november 30 2016stockbased compensation we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the companys earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 34table of contentsdisclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingenciesthe following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period

operations financial condition or cash flowsuse of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities we are also required to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best information and our actual results could differ materially from those estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentallowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our customer aging trends

related compensation expense for each award is recognized over the appropriate vesting period the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of performance shares and restricted stock units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in measured stock volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discountfor grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased

fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unitduring the quarter ended december 31 2016 due to the reorganization of our reporting structure we concluded that we had seven reporting units as a result of this change in reporting units we allocated goodwill to our reporting units based on each reporting units fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach additionally at this time we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from december 31 to november 30 of each year the change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our longterm planning 44table of contentsprocess which is a significant input to the testing we performed a goodwill impairment assessment both prior to and after the change in reporting units at november 30 this change in testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocationthe fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuationsbased on our step one goodwill impairment analysis no impairments of goodwill were deemed to have occurred and the fair value of all of reporting units was in excess of their carrying value no events occurred from november 30 2016 to december 31 2016 to indicate any changes to our impairment conclusions at november 30

credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature the credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by us bank the purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix and to allow us to continue to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases in december 2014 we amended the credit facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million and to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had 7400 million and 4500 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement which is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 we had borrowing availability of 1600 million the recorded amount of borrowings outstanding approximates fair value because of the short maturity period of the debt therefore we consider these borrowings to be a level

agents prime rate b the federal funds rate plus 050 percent or c the sum of onemonth libor plus a specified margin as of december 31 2016 the variable rate equaled libor plus 113 percent in addition

outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares repurchased pursuant to these agreements was determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 percent under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the other asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreements as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we reclassified the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock during the first quarter of 2014the delivery of 73 million shares of our common stock reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 these shares along with the 12 million shares received in february 2014 reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 57table of contentsnote 10 segment reportingour reportable segments are based on our method of internal

pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers and in august 2015 issued asu no 201514 which amended the standard as to effective date the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers for the majority of our revenue arrangements no significant impacts are expected as these transactions are not accounted for under industryspecific guidance that will be superseded by the asu and generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or services this standard is effective for us effective january 1 2018 and permits the use of either a retrospective or a cumulative effect transition method in preparation for our adoption of the new standard in the quarter beginning january 1 2018 management assembled a project management team which has obtained representative samples of contracts and other forms of agreements with our customers and is evaluating the provisions contained within those documents based on the new guidance we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows once implemented we are still evaluating the disclosure requirements under these standards as we complete our overall evaluation we are also identifying and preparing to implement changes to our accounting policies practices and controls to support the new standardsin november 2015 fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu 201517 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position asu 201517 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we have adopted this standard on a prospective basis as of december 31 201660table of contentsin february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 this update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding rightofuse asset the guidance also requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 using a modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted although we do not plan to adopt early we have obligations under lease agreements for facilities and equipment which are classified as operating leases under the existing lease standard while we are still evaluating the impact asu 201602 will have on our consolidated results of operations financial condition and cash flows our financial statements will reflect an increase in both assets and liabilities due to the requirement to recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for our facility and equipment leases note 7 to our consolidated financial statements presents our operating lease commitments as of december 31 2016 in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 this update was issued as part of the fasbs simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue sharebased payment awards to their employees the amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows and accounting policy election for forfeitures the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows this update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 the adoption of asu 201609 is expected to prospectively impact the recording of income taxes related to sharebased payment awards in our consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows the magnitude of such impacts are dependent on our future grants of stockbased compensation our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and the exercise behavior of our option holders we will prospectively adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2017 in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment this update simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test instead if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value and impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the asu is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after december 15 2019 we have not yet selected a transition date nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting 61table of contentsnote 13 supplementary data unauditedour unaudited results of operations for each of the quarters in the years ended december 31 2016 and
