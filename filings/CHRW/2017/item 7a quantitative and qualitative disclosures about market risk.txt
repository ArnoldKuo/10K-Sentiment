selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise

customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to

agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growersour flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and transportation providers changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivityour network offices work together to meet our customers needs and crosssell our services for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transactionhistorically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our

revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenuestransportation and logistics servicesch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics companywe provide all of the following transportation and logistics servicestruckloadthrough our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity we also offer timedefinite and expedited truck transportation through these motor carriersless than truckload ltlltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloadsintermodalour intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail we have intermodal marketing

shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems we utilize the information from our operating system and other available sources to select the best available carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contract carriers commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect continuously with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment and assure that the unique needs of each of our customers is satisfied for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customers order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carriers contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either 4table of contentscontractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shippers agent in those cases the carriers contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our servicesas a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customers plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the ratewe purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formulain the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of our customers supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separatelyas we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we

largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customerswe seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we

significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customersin 2016 we continued to expand our corporate sales account management and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities our executives and our corporate sales staff support our offices in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements9table of contentsrelationships with transportation providerswe continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight these relationships are critical to our successin 2016 we worked with approximately 71000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advancescontracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than 16 percent of our total cost of transportation in 2016 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 81 percent of our truckload shipments in 2016 every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrierwe also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers and lease approximately 800 containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containersin our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade laneswe operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional indirect air carrier iac internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipmentcompetitionthe

weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2016 as we experienced pricing declines throughout the year proprietary information technology and intellectual propertyour information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted

made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the publiceconomic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goalsdecrease in volumesa reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight is transactional or spot market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions in addition if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affectedcredit risk and working capitalsome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increasetransportation provider failuresa significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customersexpense managementwe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands personnel expenses are our largest expense in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demandhigher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate14table of contentsour dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control includingequipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted truckload carrierschanges in regulations impacting transportationdisruption in the supply or cost of fuelreduction or deterioration in rail service and unanticipated changes in transportation rateswe are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them includingchanges in political conditions and in governmental policieschanges in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations andwars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflictswe may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating resultsour international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks includingchanges in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxationsdifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agentslimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controlsdifferent liability standards andintellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united statesthe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that regionas we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects15table of contentsour ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managerswe face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue losswe rely on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigationour earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically operating income and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2016 as we experienced pricing declines throughout the year 16table of contentswe are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contaminationour sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable cropsbuying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims subject to a 250000 deductible is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing businessour business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier

provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by lawwe source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionlegislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be 17table of contentsable to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operationswe cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licensesour contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 30 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 26 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating resultswe may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholderswe may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affectedour growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our
