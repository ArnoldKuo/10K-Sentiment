services and logistics solutions operating through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 68000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also buy and sell fresh produce our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenuesour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply in 2015 changing market conditions impacted our results fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote this acquisition contributed approximately 65 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015 primarily in our ltl service linein 2014 market conditions were very different than in 2013 there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services additionally we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013 which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business in general a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the office network based on the profitability of their individual office 25table of contents our personnel decisions are decentralized our office managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the businessour office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 1638 employees during 2015 approximately 60 percent of this increase is a result of our acquisition of freightquote employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders our customers in 2015 we worked with more than 110000 active customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2015 our top 100 customers represented approximately 29 percent of our total revenues and approximately 25 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately two percent of our total revenuesour contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2015 our carrier base was approximately 68000 up from approximately 63000 in 2014 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2015 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity2015 compared to 2014total revenues and direct costs total transportation revenues increased 04 percent to 120 billion in 2015 from 119 billion in 2014 this increase in transportation revenues was driven by our acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes these increases were partially offset by decreased pricing to our customers primarily related to the declining cost of fuel total purchased transportation and related services decreased 20 percent in 2015 to 98 billion from 100 billion in 2014 this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs primarily related to the declining cost of fuel partially offset by the acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes our sourcing revenue decreased 31 percent to 149 billion in 2015 from 153 billion in 2014 purchased products sourced for resale decreased 37 percent in 2015 to 137 billion from 142 billion in 2014 these decreases were primarily due to decreased revenue and cost per case partially offset by increased case volumes net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 135 percent to 21 billion in 2015 from 19 billion in 2014 our transportation net revenue margin increased to 179 percent in 2015 from 159 percent in 2014 this increase in net revenue margin was driven by a decrease in transportation costs including fuel and a change in the mix of business due to growth in shorter length of haul freight and the addition of freightquote 26table of contents our truckload net revenues increased 106 percent to 13 billion in 2015 from 12 billion in 2014 truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015 organic truckload net revenues increased approximately seven percent in 2015 our acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 35 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in 2015 north american truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015 north american truckload volumes excluding freightquote increased approximately three percent in 2015 truckload net revenue margin increased in 2015 due the declining cost of fuel in our truckload business the cost of fuel is generally a pass through to our customers therefore in periods of declining fuel prices we tend to experience higher net revenue margin excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2015 our truckload transportation costs were relatively unchanged excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuelltl net revenues increased 393 percent to 3607 million in 2015 from 2589 million in 2014 freightquote contributed approximately 33 percentage points to our ltl net revenue growth in 2015 net revenue margin increased in 2015 as the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin freightquote business ltl volumes increased approximately 32 percent in 2015 our intermodal net revenue increased 10 percent to 411 million in 2015 from 406 million in

2014 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes our air transportation net revenues were unchanged at 791 million in 2015 from 791 million in 2014 this was the result of higher volumes offset by pricing declinesour customs net revenues increased 57 percent to 439 million in 2015 from 416 million in 2014 the increase was due to increased transaction volumes other logistics services net revenues which include managed services warehousing and small parcel increased 129 percent to 825 million in 2015 from 731 million in 2014 the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in 2015 sourcing net revenues increased 47 percent to 1210 million in 2015 from 1155 million in 2014 this increase was primarily due to an increase in case volumes slightly offset by a decrease in net revenue

decreased to 622 percent in 2015 from 627 percent in 2014our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2015 personnel expenses increased to 11 billion from 09 billion in 2014 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2015 to 463 percent from 468 percent in 2014 the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015 freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015 in addition we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 percent to 3588 million in 2015 from 3202 million in 2014 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily due to our acquisition of freightquote including amortization expense of 76

expense interest and other expense was 355 million in 2015 compared to 250 million in 2014 during the fourth quarter we wrote off an indemnification asset of 72 million related to the acquisition of

financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 1682 million and 1289 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 1143 million and 806 million  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 working capital at december 31 2015 was 2821 million working capital at december 31 2014 was 5296 millionwe prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities cash flow from operating activities we generated 7183 million 5134 million and 3478 million of cash flow from operations in 2015 2014 and 2013 the increase of 2049 million in cash flow from operations in 2015 is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of declining fuel prices cash used for investing activities we used 544 million of cash in 2015 3889 million of cash in 2014 and 289 million of cash in 2013 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions on december 31 2014 we funded 3594 million of the purchase price for the acquisition of freightquote into escrow accounts pursuant to the purchase agreement and for completion of the acquisition in january 2015 29table of contents we used 446 million 295 million and 482 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2015 2014 and 2013 we spent 260 million 240 millionand 359 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally in 2014 we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie the cost of the building was approximately 185 million and the majority was funded in 2013 we anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately 70 million to 80 million the increase is primarily the result of the planned construction of an additional data center which is expected to be completed in 2016 cash used for financing activities we used 6077 million 1436 million and 3649 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2015 2014 and 2013 we had net shortterm repayments of 1550 million in 2015 and net shortterm borrowings of 2300 million in 2014 on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature in december of 2014 we amended this facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019 and revise a covenant ratio this facility had 4500 million outstanding as of december 31 2015 the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2015on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2015 the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we used 2356 million 2150 million and 2203 million to pay cash dividends in 2015 2014 and 2013 the increase in 2015 was primarily the result of higher dividends paid compared to 2014 the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchases made in 2013 we also used 2299 million 1640 million and 7573 million on share repurchases in 2015 2014 and 2013 in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2015 there were 6885661 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if neededcritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates30table of contents revenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 435 million as of december 31 2015 increased compared to the allowance of 411 million as of december 31 2014 this increase was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our network of offices represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2015 stockbased compensation we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the companys earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingenciesthe following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2015

contracts 31table of contents we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 196 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2015 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation skitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe had 1682 million of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2015 substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 900 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or prime plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2015 there was 4500 million outstanding on the revolving loanwe

was 5000 million outstanding on the notes a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in

are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations including 26 contingent auto liability cases as of december 31 2015 for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsnote 8 acquisitionson january 1 2015 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of freightquotecom inc freightquote for the purpose of enhancing our less than

financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 5000 million of our outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares repurchased pursuant to these agreements was determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the other asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreements as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we reclassified the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock during the first quarter of 2014the delivery of 73 million shares of our common stock reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 these shares along with the 12 million shares received in february 2014 reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 we evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 52note 10 changes in
