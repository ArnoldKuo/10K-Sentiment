contractual relationships with approximately 68000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reportingin addition to transportation we provide sourcing services sourcing under the brand name robinson fresh robinson fresh our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growersour flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and transportation providers changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivityour network offices work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 49 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between offices the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transactionhistorically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our lessthantruckload and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities 3table of contents our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenuestransportation and logistics servicesch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics companywe provide all of the following transportation and logistics servicestruckloadthrough our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity we also offer timedefinite and expedited truck transportationless than truckload ltlltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloadsintermodalour intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail we have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america and we arrange local pickup and delivery known as drayage through local contracted motor carriers in addition we own approximately 1000 intermodal containers oceanas a nonvessel ocean common carrier nvocc or freight

indirect air carrier or freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor servicecustomsour customs brokers are licensed and regulated by us customs and border protection to assist importers and exporters in meeting federal requirements governing imports and exports other logistics serviceswe provide feebased managed services warehousing services small parcel and other servicescustomers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems with the help of information provided by our operating system employees then select a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carriers service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the employee may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different offices within our network collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers freight and the offices agree to an internal profit splitonce the contracted carrier is selected the employee communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carriers commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery4table of contents for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customers order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carriers contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shippers agent in those cases the carriers contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our servicesas a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customers plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the ratewe purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreedupon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formulain the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of our customers supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separatelyas we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers

transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2015 94 percent of our net revenues in 2014 and 93 percent in 2013 the increase in ltl in 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote on january 1 2015 the increases in ocean air and customs revenues in 2012 and 2013 were primarily related to our acquisition of phoenix international freight services

were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many instances we consolidate individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinationsour sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributorsour sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programssourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2015 six percent of our net revenues in 2014 and seven percent of our net revenues in 2013 organizationoffice network to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america in 2015 we derived approximately 90

and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customers needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead office on the account6table of contents employees both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa issued safety ratingsnetwork employees each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industryearly in their tenure most newlyhired employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training we expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeksemployees operate and are compensated

many other employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular office they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the offices earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities

offices in areas such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resourcescustomer relationshipswe work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2015 we served over 110000 active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industriesduring 2015 our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customerswe seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customersin 2015 we continued to expand our corporate sales account management and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities the network also calls on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirementsrelationships with transportation providerswe continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight these relationships are critical to our successin 2015 we worked with approximately 68000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advancescontracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2015 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2015 every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and daily through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured 9table of contents has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrierwe also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containersin our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade laneswe operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional indirect air carrier iac internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipmentcompetitionthe transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers

trends in recent years including 2015 and 2014 operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the futureproprietary information technology and intellectual propertyour information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and

compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition

open to the publiceconomic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goalsdecrease in volumesa reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight is transactional or spot market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions in addition if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affectedcredit risk and working capitalsome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increasetransportation provider failuresa significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customersexpense managementwe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands personnel expenses are our largest expense in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demandhigher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing13table of contents changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuateour dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control includingequipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted truckload carrierschanges in regulations impacting transportationdisruption in the supply or cost of fuelreduction or deterioration in rail service and unanticipated changes in transportation rateswe are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them includingchanges in political conditions and in governmental policieschanges in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations andwars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflictswe may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating resultsour international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks includingchanges in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxationsdifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agentslimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controlsdifferent liability standards andintellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united statesthe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region14table of contents as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effectsour ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managerswe face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operationswe rely on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigationour earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years including 2015 and 2014 our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future15table of contents we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contaminationour sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable cropsbuying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims subject to a 250000 deductible is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 since 2012 we have carried product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing businessour business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and

distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be 16table of contents able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operationswe cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licensesour freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 29 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 25 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating resultswe may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholderswe may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affectedour growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future

offices in north america europe asia and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 68000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also buy and sell fresh produce our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenuesour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply in 2015 changing market conditions impacted our results fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote this acquisition contributed approximately 65 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015 primarily in our ltl service linein 2014 market conditions were very different than in 2013 there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services additionally we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013 which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business in general a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the office network based on the profitability of their individual office 25table of contents our personnel decisions are decentralized our office managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the businessour office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 1638 employees during 2015 approximately 60 percent of this increase is a result of our acquisition of freightquote employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders our customers in 2015 we worked with more than 110000 active customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2015 our top 100 customers represented approximately 29 percent of our total revenues and approximately 25 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately two percent of our total revenuesour contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2015 our carrier base was approximately 68000 up from approximately 63000 in 2014 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2015 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity2015 compared to 2014total revenues and direct costs total transportation revenues increased 04 percent to 120 billion in 2015 from 119 billion in 2014 this increase in transportation revenues was driven by our acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes these increases were partially offset by decreased pricing to our customers primarily related to the declining cost of fuel total purchased transportation and related services decreased 20 percent in 2015 to 98 billion from 100 billion in 2014 this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs primarily related to the declining cost of fuel partially offset by the acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes our sourcing revenue decreased 31 percent to 149 billion in 2015 from 153 billion in 2014 purchased products sourced for resale decreased 37 percent in 2015 to 137 billion from 142 billion in 2014 these decreases were primarily due to decreased revenue and cost per case partially offset by increased case volumes net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 135 percent to 21 billion in 2015 from 19 billion in 2014 our transportation net revenue margin increased to 179 percent in 2015 from 159 percent in 2014 this increase in net revenue margin was driven by a decrease in transportation costs including fuel and a change in the mix of business due to growth in shorter length of haul freight and the addition of freightquote 26table of contents our truckload net revenues increased 106 percent to 13 billion in 2015 from 12 billion in 2014 truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015 organic truckload net revenues increased approximately seven percent in 2015 our acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 35 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in 2015 north american truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015 north american truckload volumes excluding freightquote increased approximately three percent in 2015 truckload net revenue margin increased in 2015 due the declining cost of fuel in our truckload business the cost of fuel is generally a pass through to our customers therefore in periods of declining fuel prices we tend to experience higher net revenue margin excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2015 our truckload transportation costs were relatively unchanged excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuelltl net revenues increased 393 percent to 3607 million in 2015 from 2589 million in 2014 freightquote contributed approximately 33 percentage points to our ltl net revenue growth in 2015 net revenue margin increased in 2015 as the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin freightquote business ltl volumes increased approximately 32 percent in 2015 our intermodal net revenue increased 10 percent to 411 million in 2015 from 406 million in 2014 freightquote contributed approximately 34 million to our intermodal net revenues in 2015 conversion to truckload from intermodal negatively impacted intermodal volumes and net revenues throughout 2015 our intermodal net revenues declined throughout 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016our ocean transportation net revenues increased 73 percent to 2236 million in 2015 from 2084 million in 2014 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes our air transportation net revenues were unchanged at 791 million in 2015 from 791 million in 2014 this was the result of higher volumes offset by pricing declinesour customs net revenues increased 57 percent to 439 million in 2015 from 416 million in 2014 the increase was due to increased transaction volumes other logistics services net revenues which include managed services warehousing and small parcel increased 129 percent to 825 million in 2015 from 731 million in 2014 the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in 2015 sourcing net revenues increased 47 percent to 1210 million in 2015 from 1155 million in 2014 this increase was primarily due to an increase in case volumes slightly offset by a decrease in net revenue per case our net revenue margin increased to 81 percent in 2015 compared to 75 percent in 2014operating expenses operating expenses increased 120 percent to 14 billion in 2015 from 13 billion in 2014 this was due to an increase of 120 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 120 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 622 percent in 2015 from 627 percent in 2014our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2015 personnel expenses increased to 11 billion from 09 billion in 2014 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2015 to 463 percent from 468 percent in 2014 the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015 freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015 in addition we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 percent to 3588 million in 2015 from 3202 million in 2014 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily due to our acquisition of freightquote including amortization expense of 76 million and an increase in travel expenses income from operations income from operations increased 147 percent to 8583 million in 2015 from 7484 million in 2014 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 378 percent in 2015

2015 compared to 250 million in 2014 during the fourth quarter we wrote off an indemnification asset of 72 million related to the acquisition of phoenix as the indemnification obligations of the sellers expired the impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations in addition we had a higher average outstanding balance on our shortterm borrowings throughout 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote provision for income taxes our effective income

to 2013 primarily due to the 85 million shares repurchased as part of accelerated share asr repurchase program initiated in 2013liquidity and capital resourceswe have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in december 2014 we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019 and to revise a covenant ratio in 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 500 million worth of our common stock the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 1682 million and 1289 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 cash and cash

2014 was 5296 millionwe prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities cash flow from operating activities we generated 7183 million 5134 million and 3478 million of cash flow from operations in 2015 2014 and 2013 the increase of 2049 million in cash flow from operations in 2015 is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of declining fuel prices cash used for investing activities we used 544 million of cash in 2015 3889 million of cash in 2014 and 289 million of cash in 2013 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid

technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally in 2014 we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie the cost of the building was approximately 185 million and the majority was funded in 2013 we anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately 70 million to 80 million the increase is primarily the result of the planned construction of an additional data center which is expected to be completed in 2016 cash used for financing activities we used 6077 million 1436 million and 3649 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2015 2014 and 2013 we had net shortterm

will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2015on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2015 the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we used 2356 million 2150 million and 2203 million to pay cash dividends in 2015 2014 and 2013 the increase in 2015 was primarily the result of higher dividends paid compared to 2014 the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchases made in 2013 we also used 2299 million 1640 million and 7573 million on share repurchases in 2015 2014 and 2013 in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2015 there were 6885661 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if neededcritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates30table of contents revenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 435 million as of december 31 2015 increased compared to the allowance of 411 million as of december 31 2014 this increase was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our network of offices represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2015 stockbased compensation we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the companys earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingenciesthe following table

capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 196 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2015 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation skitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe had 1682 million of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2015 substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with

location and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 49 percent of our truckload transactions are shared transactions between offices in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all locations the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction accordingly our chief operating decision maker

our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of january 1 2015note 9 accelerated share repurchaseon august 24 2013 we entered into two letter agreements with unrelated third party financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 5000 million of our outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares repurchased pursuant to these agreements was determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the other asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreements as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we reclassified the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock during the first quarter of 2014the delivery of 73 million shares of our common stock reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 these shares along with the 12 million shares received in february 2014 reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 we evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 52note 10 changes in
