46000 active customers we operate through a network of 285 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america and australia we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customersas a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 63000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reportingin addition to transportation we provide sourcing services sourcing our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and merchandising we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh produce under consumer recognized brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growershistorically we provided feebased payment services payment services primarily through our subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek provided a variety of payment management and business intelligence services primarily to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services included funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management for most of these services tchek charged a fee per transaction on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source llc efs we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers through continued agreements with efsour flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 285 offices our branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and transportation providers changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most branch employees compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivityour branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction3table of contentshistorically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional branch employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network and market presence our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenuestransportation and logistics servicesch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics companywe provide all of the following transportation and logistics servicestruckloadthrough our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity we also offer timedefinite and expedited truck transportationless than truckload ltlltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloadsintermodalour intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail we have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america and we arrange local pickup and delivery known as drayage through local contracted motor carriers in addition we own approximately 1000 intermodal containers oceanas a nonvessel ocean common carrier nvocc or freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipmentsairas a certified indirect air carrier

importers and exporters in meeting federal requirements governing imports and exports other logistics serviceswe provide feebased transportation management services warehousing services and other servicescustomers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson branch responsible for their account the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems with the help of information provided by our operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carriers service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and 4table of contentsrates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branches collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit splitonce the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carriers commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to deliveryfor most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customers order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carriers contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our management services business we are acting as the shippers agent in those cases the carriers contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our servicesas a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customers plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the ratewe purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formulain the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of our customers supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separatelyas we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of

2012 and 2013 are primarily related to our acquisition of phoenix on november 1 2012 sourcingsince we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinationsour sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributorsour sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programssourcing accounted for approximately seven percent of our net revenues in 2013 and eight percent of our net revenues in 2012 and 2011 payment serviceson october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the operations of tchek which represented a majority of our payment services however we still earn payment services revenues when we advance money to our contract carriers payment services accounted for less than one percent of our net revenues in 2013 three percent of our net revenues in 2012 and four percent of our net revenues in 2011 6table of contentsorganizationbranch network to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call branches we currently have 285 branches in the following areas of the world regionnumber ofbranchesnorth america189europe52asia38south america5australia1each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation branch employees are often called upon to handle customers unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customers needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead branch on the accountemployees in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts branch employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to assure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa issued safety ratingsbranch employees branch offices are responsible for their hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their branch and balancing personnel resources with their business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industryearly in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a branch team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new branch employees to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeksemployees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and branch employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and most branch employees are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branchs earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key branch employees for a short period of timeall of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employeesindividual branch employees benefit both

information technology legal marketing and human resource support are supported centrallycustomer relationshipswe seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2013 we served over 46000 active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industriesduring 2013 our largest customer accounted for approximately three percent of total revenues and approximately two percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customersbranches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our branch employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive team branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customerswe have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements9table of contentsrelationships with transportation providerswe continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight these relationships are critical to our successin 2013 we worked with approximately 63000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our branch employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advancescontracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2013 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2013 every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and daily through subscriptions with a third party service we assure that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrierwe also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containersin our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade laneswe operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional air freight forwarder internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific

to seasonal trends in recent years operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us

common stock we intend to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the pslra by providing this discussion economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goalsdecrease in volumesa reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight is transactional or spot market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market overall by the economic recession in addition if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affectedcredit risk and working capitalsome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increasetransportation provider failuresa significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customersexpense managementwe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands personnel is our largest expense in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level 13table of contentsto our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demandhigher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricingchanging fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declinesour dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control includingequipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted truckload carriersinterruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputeschanges in regulations impacting transportation andunanticipated changes in transportation rateswe are subject to negative impacts of changes in political conditions all of our business operations are subject to the influences of significant political changes and our ability to respond to them includingchanges in economic and political conditions and in governmental policieschanges in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations andwars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflictswe may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating resultsour international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks includingchanges in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxationsdifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agentslimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controlsdifferent liability standards andintellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united statesthe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region14table of contentsas we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effectsour ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managerswe face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operationswe are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america and australia supported by executives and shared and centralized services with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business in their branch and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigationour earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future15table of contentswe are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident in 2011 2012 and 2013 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contaminationour sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable cropssourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination this risk is mitigated in the majority of cases where we source produce as we do not handle or package the product product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing businessour business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our business operations are regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a property freight broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nvocc bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditionlegislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surchargesdepartment of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations16table of contentswe cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licensesa significant increase in fraud or theft could adversely affect our results we have exposure to both internal and external fraud and theft unauthorized or fraudulent requests for advances or payment can occur a significant increase in fraudulent activity could adversely affect our resultswe derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 32 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 28 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately three percent of our consolidated total revenues and approximately two percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating resultswe may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholderswe may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affectedour growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by ten percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could

company we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and australia as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 63000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our former subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek which provided a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source efs we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriersour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch officein addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branchs volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business25table of contentsour branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transactionour people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 747 employees during 2013 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our branch employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees in 2012 and 2013 we also issued restricted equity awards that vest evenly over five years starting on december 31 2013 and december 31 2014 our customers in 2013 we worked with more than 46000 active customers up from approximately 42000 in 2012 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 32  percent of our total revenues and approximately 28 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately three percent of our total revenues and approximately two percent of our total net revenuesour contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2013 our carrier base was approximately 63000 up from approximately 56000 in 2012 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2013 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity2013 compared to 2012total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues increased 123 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 total transportation revenues increased 143 percent to 111 billion in 2013 from 97 billion in 2012 this increase was driven by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 149 percent in 2013 to 94 billion from 82 billion in 2012 this increase was due to higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and higher transportation costs our sourcing revenue increased 30 percent to 17 billion in 2013 from 16 billion in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes purchased products sourced for resale increased 39 percent in 2013 to 154 billion from 148 billion in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes and higher cost per case our payment services revenue decreased 753 percent to 132 million in 2013 from 535 million in 2012 the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to efs on october 16 2012net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 111 percent to 170 billion in 2013 from 153 billion in 2012 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 153

2013 from 2242 million in 2012 the increase in net revenues was driven by an increase in total shipments of seven percent partially offset by decreased net revenue margin our ltl transportation costs are increasing while customer pricing has not kept up with increases in carrier costs our intermodal net revenue increase of 07 percent to 391 million in 2013 from 388 million in 2012 was driven largely by a change in the mix of business and improved customer pricing partially offset by volume declines our ocean transportation net revenues increased 1210 percent to 1877 million in 2013 from 849 million in 2012 our air transportation net revenues increased 645 percent to 731 million in 2013 from 444 million in 2012 our customs net revenues increased 1007 percent to 366 million in 2013

small parcel increased 182 percent to 679 million in 2013 from 574 million in 2012 this increase was primarily due to an increase in warehouse servicessourcing net revenues decreased 70 percent to 1270 million in 2013 from 1364 million in 2012 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in business with a large customer and a decrease in net revenue per case partially offset by increased volumes we expect the revenue declines with this large customer to continue in 2014 our net revenue margin decreased to 76 percent in 2013 compared to 84 percent in 2012historically payment services was comprised primarily of revenue related to our former subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 797 percent to 108 million in 2013 from 530 million in 2012 the decrease was due to

107 percent to 12 billion in 2013 from 10 billion in 2012 this was due to an increase of 79 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 183 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses increased to 628 percent in 2013 from 607 percent in 2012 this increase was primarily due to increased personnel and other selling general and administrative expenses as a result of our acquisitions in 2012our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2013 personnel expenses increased to 8267 million from 7660 million in 2012 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2013 to 450 percent from 446 percent in 2012 in 2013 our average headcount increased approximately 25 percent related primarily to the acquisitions of apreo and phoenix the increase in personnel expense from headcount growth was partially offset by declines in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 183 percent to 3268 million in 2013 from 2762 million in 2012 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in amortization of intangible assets acquired occupancy and travel partially offset by a reduction in purchased professional services income from operations income from operations increased 11 percent to 6827 million in 2013 from 6753 million in 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 372 percent in 2013 from 393 percent in 2012 this decrease was due to our expenses growing faster than our net revenues additionally phoenix has a higher operating expense to net revenue ratio than ch robinson has historically experienced investment and other expense income investment and other expense income was an expense of 93 million in 2013 compared to income of 2831

margin decreased to 158 percent in 2012 from 165 percent in 2011 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to

dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2013in 2013 we had longterm borrowings of 5000 million on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2013 the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2013 we used 2203 million 2754 million and 1947 million to pay cash dividends in 2013 2012 and 2011 the decrease in 2013 was due to a fifth quarterly dividend paid in 2012 and a lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate in 2013 to 035 per share from 033 per share in 2012 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to a fifth quarterly dividend paid at 035 per share in december 2012 the board of directors modified the dividend payment date to be the last day of the quarter in which it is declared this is a change from the previous policy which was to pay the cash dividend on the first day of the following quarter from which the cash dividend was declared we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on the last day of the quarter for which they were declared by the board of directors additionally the rate for our first four quarterly dividends increased to 033 per share in 2012 from 029 per share in 2011we also used 7573 million 2451 million and 2409 million on share repurchases in 2013 2012 and 2011 the increase in 2013 was due to the 5000 million of shares repurchased as part of the asr agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2013 we received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements in december 2013 one of the banks terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2013 there were 14069925 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed30table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 393 million as of december 31 2013 increased compared to the allowance of 346 million as of december 31 2012 this increase was primarily due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2013 stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 18 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends31table of contentsdisclosures about contractual obligations and

no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 215 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is

during the year ended december 31 2013 to the previously recorded opening balances relate primarily to changes in the allocation of purchase consideration to certain accounts based on resolution of certain working capital adjustments with the selling shareholders the adjustments during 2013 resulted in a 15 million increase in receivables a 53 million increase in goodwill a 17 million decrease in current deferred taxes a 21 million decrease in noncurrent deferred assets a 30 million decrease in taxes payable and a 106 million increase in other assets the other asset recorded is an

9 accelerated share repurchaseon august 24 2013 we entered into two letter agreements with unrelated third party financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 5000 million of our outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares to be repurchased pursuant to these agreements is determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the remaining asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreement as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 subsequent to december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we will reclassify the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock during the first quarter of 2014the delivery of 73 million shares of our common stock reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we have also evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2013 note 10 changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss accumulated other comprehensive loss is included in the stockholders investment on our consolidated balance sheet the recorded balance at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 was 106 million and 93 million respectively accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised solely of foreign currency translation adjustment at december 31 2013 and 2012 in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss this guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income entities may present this information either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes this guidance was applied on january 1 2013 the guidance required additional disclosures however it did not impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows during the year ended december 31 2013 no amounts of accumulated other comprehensive loss were reclassified into net income54table of contentsnote 11 supplementary dataour unaudited results of operations for each of the quarters in
