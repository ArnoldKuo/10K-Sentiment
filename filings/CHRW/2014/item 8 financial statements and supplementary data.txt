company we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and australia as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 63000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our former subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek which provided a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source efs we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriersour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch officein addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branchs volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business25table of contentsour branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transactionour people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 747 employees during 2013 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our branch employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees in 2012 and 2013 we also issued restricted equity awards that vest evenly over five years starting on december 31 2013 and december 31 2014 our customers in 2013 we worked with more than 46000 active customers up from approximately 42000 in 2012 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 32  percent of our total revenues and approximately 28 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately three percent of our total revenues and approximately two percent of our total net revenuesour contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2013 our carrier base was approximately 63000 up from approximately 56000 in 2012 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2013 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity2013 compared to 2012total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues increased 123 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 total transportation revenues increased 143 percent to 111 billion in 2013 from 97 billion in 2012 this increase was driven by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 149 percent in 2013 to 94 billion from 82 billion in 2012 this increase was due to higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and higher transportation costs our sourcing revenue increased 30 percent to 17 billion in 2013 from 16 billion in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes purchased products sourced for resale increased 39 percent in 2013 to 154 billion from 148 billion in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes and higher cost per case our payment services revenue decreased 753 percent to 132 million in 2013 from 535 million in 2012 the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to efs on october 16 2012net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 111 percent to 170 billion in 2013 from 153 billion in 2012 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 153 percent in 2013 from 158 percent in 2012 largely driven by higher transportation costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers 26table of contentsour truckload net revenues decreased 05 percent to 105 billion in 2013 from 106 billion in 2012 truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in 2013 truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2013 due to

2013 from 2242 million in 2012 the increase in net revenues was driven by an increase in total shipments of seven percent partially offset by decreased net revenue margin our ltl transportation costs are increasing while customer pricing has not kept up with increases in carrier costs our intermodal net revenue increase of 07 percent to 391 million in 2013 from 388 million in 2012 was driven largely by a change in the mix of business and improved customer pricing partially offset by volume declines our ocean transportation net revenues increased 1210 percent to 1877 million in 2013 from 849 million in 2012 our air transportation net revenues increased 645 percent to 731 million in 2013 from 444 million in 2012 our customs net revenues increased 1007 percent to 366 million in 2013 from 182 million in 2012 these increases were primarily driven by our acquisition of phoenix other logistics services net revenues which include transportation management services warehousing and small parcel increased 182 percent to 679 million in 2013 from 574 million in 2012 this increase was primarily due to an increase in warehouse servicessourcing net revenues decreased 70 percent to 1270 million in 2013 from 1364 million in 2012 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in business with a large customer and a decrease in net revenue per case partially offset by increased volumes we expect the revenue declines with this large customer to continue in 2014 our net revenue margin decreased to 76 percent in 2013 compared to 84 percent in 2012historically payment services was comprised primarily of revenue related to our former subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 797 percent to 108 million in 2013 from 530 million in 2012 the decrease was due to

107 percent to 12 billion in 2013 from 10 billion in 2012 this was due to an increase of 79 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 183 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses increased to 628 percent in 2013 from 607 percent in 2012 this increase was primarily due to increased personnel and other selling general and administrative expenses as a result of our acquisitions in 2012our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2013 personnel expenses increased to 8267 million from 7660 million in 2012 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2013 to 450 percent from 446 percent in 2012 in 2013 our average headcount increased approximately 25 percent related primarily to the acquisitions of apreo and phoenix the increase in personnel expense from headcount growth was partially offset by declines in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 183 percent to 3268 million in 2013 from 2762 million in 2012 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in amortization of intangible assets acquired occupancy and travel partially offset by a reduction in purchased professional services income from operations income from operations increased 11 percent to 6827 million in 2013 from 6753 million in 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 372 percent in 2013 from 393 percent in 2012 this decrease was due to our expenses growing faster than our net revenues additionally phoenix has a higher operating expense to net revenue ratio than ch robinson has historically experienced investment and other expense income investment and other expense income was an expense of 93 million in 2013 compared to income of 2831 million in 2012 in 2013 we recorded interest expense on borrowings of 111 million in 2012 we recorded a gain of 2816 million on the divestiture of substantially all of our tchek business provision for

margin decreased to 158 percent in 2012 from 165 percent in 2011 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our truckload business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2012our truckload net revenues increased 21 percent to 106

a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 5000 million worth of our common stock we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially

2100 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 802 million and 1033 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 working capital at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 3945 million and 4401 millionwe prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we

4297 million of cash flow from operations in 2013 2012 and 2011 during 2013 our cash flow from operations decreased 245 percent compared to a 300 percent decrease in net income during the first

development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally we built a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie this building cost approximately 185 million we have spent 140 million on the building through december 31 2013 we expect to fund the balance of costs to complete the building in the first quarter of 201429table of contentsin 2012 we purchased 500 intermodal

used for financing activities we used 3649 million 2643 million and 4151 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2013 2012 and 2011 in 2013 and 2012 we had net shortterm borrowings of 1214 million and 2484 million respectively on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature of which 3750 million was outstanding as of december 31 2013 the purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2013in 2013 we had longterm borrowings of 5000 million on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2013 the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2013 we used 2203 million 2754 million and 1947 million to pay cash dividends in 2013 2012 and 2011 the decrease in 2013 was due to a fifth quarterly dividend paid in 2012 and a lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate in 2013 to 035 per share from 033 per share in 2012 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to a fifth quarterly dividend paid at 035 per share in december 2012 the board of directors modified the dividend payment date to be the last day of the quarter in which it is declared this is a change from the previous policy which was to pay the cash dividend on the first day of the following quarter from which the cash dividend was declared we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on the last day of the quarter for which they were declared by the board of directors additionally the rate for our first four quarterly dividends increased to 033 per share in 2012 from 029 per share in 2011we also used 7573 million 2451 million and 2409 million on share repurchases in 2013 2012 and 2011 the increase in 2013 was due to the 5000 million of shares repurchased as part of the asr agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2013 we received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements in december 2013 one of the banks terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2013 there were 14069925 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed30table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 393 million as of december 31 2013 increased compared to the allowance of 346 million as of december 31 2012 this increase was primarily due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2013 stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 18 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends31table of contentsdisclosures about contractual obligations and

consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ch robinson worldwide inc and our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries our minority interests in subsidiaries are not significant all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statementsuse of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities we are also required to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our ultimate results could differ from those estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management services and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentallowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our customer aging trends historical loss experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identifiedforeign currency most balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated or remeasured at the current exchange rate as of the

component to optimizing logistics solutions for our customersthese services are performed throughout our branch offices as an integrated offering for which our customers are typically provided a single invoice our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46 percent of our truckload transactions are shared transactions between branches in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction accordingly our chief operating decision maker

litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations including fifteen contingent auto liability cases as of december 31 2013 for such legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsnote 8 acquisitions and

9 accelerated share repurchaseon august 24 2013 we entered into two letter agreements with unrelated third party financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 5000 million of our outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares to be repurchased pursuant to these agreements is determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the remaining asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreement as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 subsequent to december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we will reclassify the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock during the first quarter of 2014the delivery of 73 million shares of our common stock reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we have also evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2013 note 10 changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss accumulated other comprehensive loss is included in the stockholders investment on our consolidated balance sheet the recorded balance at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 was 106 million and 93 million respectively accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised solely of foreign currency translation

loss this guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income entities may present this information either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes this guidance was applied on january 1 2013 the guidance required additional disclosures however it did not impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows during the year ended december
