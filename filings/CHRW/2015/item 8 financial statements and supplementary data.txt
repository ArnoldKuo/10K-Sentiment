and logistics solutions operating through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 66000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also buy and sell fresh produce and offer feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our former subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of our payment services business to electronic funds source we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriersour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply in 2014 changing market conditions impacted our results there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services additionally we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013 which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business in general a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the office network based on the profitability of their individual office in 2014 we were able to leverage our past investments of talent and adapt to changing market conditions and drive efficiencies in our network we experienced 25table of contentsrecord north american truckload productivity levels in 2014 as measured by volumes per person in 2015 we expect to grow our headcount to support our future volume growth our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the businessour branch office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities our october 2012 acquisition of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland enhanced our truckload capabilities in europe our november 2012 acquisition of phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois expanded our global forwarding network our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount decreased by 155 employees during 2014 employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders our

equivalents totaled 1289 million and 1620 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 806 million and 802 million as of december 31 2014

the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities cash flow from operating activities we generated 5134 million 3478 million and 4603 million of cash flow from operations in 2014 2013 and 2012 the increase of 1656 million in cash flow from operations in 2014 is primarily the result of a 1015 million decrease in accrued income taxes and increases in stockbased compensation and accrued compensation and

capital expenditures in 2014 2013 and 2012 we spent 240 million 359 million and 420 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally we built a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie the cost of

into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature in december of 2014 we amended this facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million and extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019 this facility had 6050 million outstanding as of december 31 2014 the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2014on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2014 the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we used 2150 million 2203 million and 2754 million to pay cash dividends in 2014 2013 and 2012 the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013 the decrease in 2013 was due to a fifth quarterly dividend paid in 2012 and a lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate in 2013 to 035 per share from 033 per share in 2012 we also used 1640 million 7573 million and 2451 million on share repurchases in 2014 2013 and 2012 the increase in 2013 was due to the 5000 million of shares repurchased as part of the asr agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2013 we received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements in december 2013 one of the banks terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2014 there were 10306342 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed30table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 411 million as of december 31 2014 increased compared to the allowance of 393 million as of december 31 2013 this increase was primarily due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2014 stockbased compensation we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the companys earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends

air freight capacity telecommunications services and maintenance contracts we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 240 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2014 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec

these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are

of ch robinson worldwide inc and our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries our minority interests in subsidiaries are not significant all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statementsuse of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities we are also required to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our ultimate results could differ from those estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management services and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not presentallowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our customer aging trends historical loss experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identifiedforeign currency most balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated or remeasured at the current exchange rate as of the end of the year statement of operations items are

transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one location and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 48 percent of our truckload transactions are shared transactions between offices in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all locations the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction accordingly our chief operating decision maker analyzes our business as a single segment relying on net revenues and

threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations including 20 contingent auto liability cases as of december 31 2014 for such legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations

datesnote 9 accelerated share repurchaseon august 24 2013 we entered into two letter agreements with unrelated third party financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of 5000 million of our outstanding common stock the asr agreements the total aggregate number of shares repurchased pursuant to these agreements was determined based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock during the purchase period less a fixed discount of 094 under the asr agreements we paid 5000 million to the financial institutions and received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements one of the two financial institutions terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares on december 13 2013 we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of 4250 million and recorded the remaining 750 million as a decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 in accordance with the terms of the other asr agreement we had the option to settle our delivery obligation if any in cash or shares and we may be required to settle in cash in very limited circumstances we accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the asr agreements as a forward contract indexed to our common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore was not accounted for as a derivative instrument but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity the remaining asr agreement continued to meet those requirements for equity classification as of december 31 2013 in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement we reclassified the 750 million recorded in additional paid in capital to treasury stock

calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 these shares along with the 12 million shares received in february 2014 reduced our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended december 31 2014 we evaluated the asr agreement for the potential dilutive effects of any shares remaining to be received upon settlement and determined that the additional shares would be antidilutive and therefore were not included in our eps calculation for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2013 note 10 changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss accumulated other comprehensive loss is included in the stockholders investment on our consolidated balance sheet the recorded balance at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 was 286 million and 106 million respectively accumulated other comprehensive
