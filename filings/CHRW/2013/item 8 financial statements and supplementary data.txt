transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and australia as a third party logistics provider we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 56000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation 23table of contentsfor each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization riskin addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our subsidiary tchek which provided a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to efs we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues of approximately 3 million per quarter from the tchek cash advance option we offer our contracted carriersour business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenueswe keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch officein addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branchs volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the businessour branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 43 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transactionour people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 2576 employees during 2012 this was primarily due to the acquisitions of phoenix and apreo during the fourth quarter of 2012 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our branch employees compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between 24table of contentsemployees and our shareholders generally these awards vest over fiveyear periods and also include performancebased requirements in 2012 we also issued restricted equity awards that vest evenly over five years starting on december 31 2013 our customers in 2012 we worked with more than 42000 active customers up from approximately 37000 in 2011 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 29 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 22 percent of our total net revenuesour contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2012 our carrier base was approximately 56000 up from approximately 53000 in 2011 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2012 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacityour goals since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth goal has been 15 percent for net revenues income from operations and earnings per share although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals over the period since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm goal of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 2012 compared to 2011total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues increased 99 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 total transportation revenues increased 108 percent to 969 billion in 2012 from 874 billion in 2011 this increase was driven by higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 118 percent in 2012 to 816 billion from 730 billion in 2011 this increase was due to higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs including the impacts of higher fuel costs our sourcing revenue increased 55 percent to 162 billion in 2012 from 154 billion in 2011 purchased products sourced for resale increased 54 percent in 2012 to 148 billion from 141 billion in 2011 these increases were primarily due to higher case volumes our payment services revenue decreased 112 percent to 535 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to electronic funds source llc on october 16 2012net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 58 percent to 153 billion in 2012 from 144 billion in 2011 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 158 percent in 2012 from 165 percent in 2011 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our truckload business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2012truck net revenues which consist of truckload and ltl services comprise approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 39 percent to 128 billion in 2012 from 124 billion in 2011 truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in 2012 truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2012 due to increased cost of capacity and an increase in fuel prices partially offset by increased rates charged to our

percent excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuelduring 2012 our ltl net revenues increased approximately 13 percent the increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes

percent to 388 million in 2012 from 412 million in 2011 was driven largely by increased cost of capacity our ocean transportation net revenues increased 270 percent to 849 million in 2012 from 669

phoenix 25table of contentsother logistics services net revenues which include transportation management services customs warehousing and small parcel increased 264 percent to 757 million in 2012 from

growth in other logistics services net revenues during 2012sourcing net revenues increased 62 percent to 1364 million in 2012 from 1284 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased

subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 121 percent to 530 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the tchek divestiture on october 16 2012 we have recorded a

with changes in net revenues and profitabilityother selling general and administrative expenses increased 134 percent to 2762 million in 2012 from 2437 million in 2011 approximately 106 million of this increase is related to investment banking and other external legal and accounting fees paid for the acquisitions and divestitures in 2012 the remaining increase in our selling general and

expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities we continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation our current interestbearing cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash holdings and municipal money market funds our investment income related to cash and cash equivalents is down compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of highquality shortterm investmentscash flow from operating activities we generated 4603 million

development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the businessin 2012 we purchased 500 intermodal containers for 52 million and funded the balance of the 2011 container purchases in 2011 we also purchased a new corporate aircraft for 73 million and 500 intermodal containers for 48 million we anticipate capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately 55 million to 60 millionwe used cash of 5836 million for acquisitions in 2012 on october 1 2012 we acquired apreo for 228 million net of cash acquired on november 1 2012 we paid 5608 million in cash for phoenix net of cash acquired in 2011 we sold our remaining availableforsale securities which generated 93 million of cash from investing activities during 2010 we sold nearly all

2643 million 4151 million and 2891 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2012 2011 and 2010 in 2012 we had net borrowings of 2536 million on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature which expires on october 29 2017 the purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will allow us to continue to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2012we used 2754 million 1947 million and 1689 million to pay cash dividends in 2012 2011 and 2010 the increase in 2012 was due primarily to a fifth quarterly dividend paid at 035 per share in december 2012 the board of directors modified the dividend payment date to be the last day of the quarter in which it is declared this is a change from the previous policy which was to pay the cash dividend on the first day of the following quarter from which the cash dividend was declared going forward in 2013 we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on the last day of the quarter for which they were declared by the board of directors additionally the rate for our first four quarterly dividends increased to 033 per share in 2012 from 029 per share in 2011we also used 2451 million 2409 million and 1511 million on share repurchases in 2012 2011 and 2010 the increase in 2012 was due to a 20 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2011 partially offset by a 13 percent decrease in the average price per share repurchased the increase in 2011 was due primarily to a 41 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2010 we are currently purchasing shares under the 2009 authorization of 10000000 shares as of december 31 2012 there were 827443 shares remaining under this authorization during the third quarter of 2012 the board of directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10000000 shares of our common stock the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditionsassuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations and the amount available under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice if neededcritical accounting policies and estimatesour consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimatesrevenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisionsadditionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage and transportation management are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present29table of contentsvaluations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 346 million as of december 31 2012 increased compared to the allowance of 313 million as of december 31 2011 this increase was due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experiencegoodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2012stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividendsdisclosures about

telecommunications services maintenance contracts and commodities seeds used in our sourcing businesswe have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 206 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2012 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec

equivalents although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 500 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan
